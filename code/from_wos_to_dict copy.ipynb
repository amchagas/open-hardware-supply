       " 'abstract': ['Due to the complexity of multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) wireless channels, direct measurement is the main viable option for accurate characterization. Details on a new low-cost wideband channel sounder are presented, which was mainly constructed from conventional instruments and components. This switched architecture system is similar to commercial channel sounders and has modest cost (< US$ 50000). The sounder operates in the 2- to 8-GHz range with up to 100 MHz of instantaneous bandwidth and supports eight transmitters and receivers, which are sufficient to support the development and assessment of current and future MIMO wireless systems. In this \"open-hardware\" project, the hardware design and software components are openly available to other researchers interested in developing or enhancing the MIMO measurement capability. The actual systems built at the University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa, and Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, are presented, as are some example studies.',\n",
       "  'Eye tracking has long held the promise of being a useful methodology for human computer interaction. However, a number of barriers have stood in the way of the integration of eye tracking into everyday applications, including the intrusiveness, robustness, availability and price of eye-tracking systems. To lower these barriers, we have developed the openEyes system. The system consists of an open-hardware design for a digital eye tracker that can be built from low-cost off-the-shelf components, and a set of open-source software tools for digital image capture, manipulation, and analysis in eye-tracking applications. We expect that the availability of this system will facilitate the development of eye-tracking applications and the eventual integration of eye tracking into the next generation of everyday human computer interfaces. We discuss the methods and technical challenges of low-cost eye tracking as well as the design decisions that produced our current system.',\n",
       "  'This work presents an on-going project that consists in providing low-cost telephony services in remote areas in the Amazon region, North Brazil. The idea is to build GSM networks using open-source and open-hardware projects, such as: OpenBTS, Openmoko, IP04, Asterisk and USRP. The NavegaPara Program, which currently connects thirteen cities in the state, provides the backbone network with optical fiber and digital radios. This paper summarizes the project and discusses the strategy adopted to circumvent a specific problem: the establishment of know-how on GSM technologies among engineering (electrical and computer) students. Several hands-on experiments in GSM technologies are being currently used and some are described here. For example, the work discusses how the Matlab toolkit GSMsim can be used to analyze digitized GSM waveforms. It also describes the development of a QAM modulator for better understanding the basics of GNU Radio. The success of the project will be measured by the effect in the life of citizens who, currently, do not have any access to a phone for basic communication needs.',\n",

Careful hardware selection allows existing laboratory exercises to be modified for use with the platform, and the platform enables new exercises that would not be possible in a traditional lab. We describe the adoption of these kits in a course designed for on-campus and remote students that teaches the science and technology of modern display systems. We find that the platform delivers a consistent, high quality laboratory experience for both on-campus and remote students.',\n",

Several hundred integrated computing nodes, each hosting up to 512 neurons, will he interconnected and operated on un-cut silicon wafers. The electro-technical aspects and the details of the hardware implementation are covered in a separate contribution to this conference. This paper focuses on the usability of the system by demonstrating that biologically relevant network models can in fact be mapped to this system. Different network configurations am established on the hardware by programmable switch matrices, repeaters, and address decoders. Systematic routing algorithms are presented to map a given network model to the hardware system. Routing is simulated for several network examples, proving the system's practical applicability. Furthermore, the routing simulations are used to fix values for yet open hardware parameters.\",\n",

In this article, a scheme using background modeling based on runtime-weighted features for robustly adaptive moving object segmentation in infrared (IR) image sequence is proposed. Proposed background modeling for an open hardware (H/W) architecture design decreases the size of the search area to construct a sparse block template of search area in infrared images. The authors also compensate for motion compensation when the image moves in previous and current frames of IR imaging system. The method of separation of background and objects applies to adaptive values through time analysis of pixel intensity The proposed method uses more feature information such as intensity, deviation, block matching error, and velocity. The weighting values give a higher weight to feature information which has a large difference between the object and the background region. Based on experimental results, the proposed method showed real-time moving object segmentation through background modeling in the proposed embedded system.

A fundamental solution to manage the complexity is reuse engineering.

First, this paper identifies the main items possessing the large portion of SCA-based SDR handheld embedded system by the experiment on the target platform which is similar to a commercial mobile handheld system. Both the world interoperabillity for microwave access (WiMAX) and high speed downlink packet access (HS-DPA) waveform software packages are used as an SCA waveform application. This paper also presents the results of the relative binary size distribution of SCA software resources for looking for the major elements making an SCA-based SDR handheld embedded system heavier. As a result, when focusing on the relative weight portion of SCA core framework (CF), the SCA CF takes 16% up and others have 84% out of the whole binary size distribution of SCA software resources. The results of the experiment give us notice that the weight portion of SCA CF is minor and compatible with the overall software binary size needs of an SCA-based SDR handheld embedded system, on the other hand, the practical problem on the lightweight is in a common object request broker architecture (CORBA) and extensible markup language (XML) parser resources. Second, this paper describes an important feature for implementing a high speed broadband radio to an SCA waveform and presents the performance evaluation results of the SCA port communication on both power PC (PPC) 405 and x86 processor platforms. The PPC 405 platform, which is similar to a commercial mobile handset, takes the value of average round trip time (RTT) with a maximum of thirty six millisecond. The x86 platform, however, which is analogous to a server platform, maintains stable micro-second resolution. From our experiments, we observe that rapid SCA port communication, sufficiently less than the frame length of high-speed broadband radios, should be provided for serving those radio services in a commercial handheld system based on the SCA.',\n",

However, commercially available NICs lack programmability. Furthermore, the use of standard NICs implies that each packet crosses the bus twice, and is processed and routed in software by the OS, thus reducing forwarding performance.

This new technology has transformed the cytogenetics laboratory by adapting techniques that have heretofore been the province of molecular geneticists. Intimate knowledge and comfortable familiarity with these techniques are now a must for the modern cytogeneticist, rather than a stimulating but discretionary intellectual exercise or an elective luxury.

This technical convergence between molecular diagnostics and clinical cytogenetics is exciting and has already resulted in many stimulating discoveries. However, the traditional skills of the cytogeneticist are needed now more than ever before. As our ability to inspect the genome increases, so does the variety of abnormalities that we uncover. Understanding the mechanisms of these aberrations to guide additional testing of the parents and genetic counseling of the patients and their families requires the expertise of individuals who are well-versed in meiotic mechanisms and chromosomal structures that may lead to these abnormalities.

       "  'We describe herein the features of a novel cultivation system, combining electrical stimulation with medium perfusion for producing thick, functional cardiac patches. A custom-made electrical stimulator was integrated via inserting two carbon rod electrodes into a perfusion bioreactor, housing multiple neonatal Sprague-Dawley rat cardiac cell constructs between two 96% open-pore-area fixing nets. The stimulator produced adjustable stimulation waveform (i.e., duty cycle, number of stimulating channels, maximum stimulation amplitude, etc.), specially designed for cardiac cell stimulation. The cell constructs were subjected to a homogenous fluid flow regime and electrical stimulation under conditions optimal for cell excitation. The stimulation threshold in the bioreactor was set by first determining its value in a Petri dish under a microscope, and then matching the current density in the two cultivation systems by constructing electric field models. The models were built by Comsol Multiphysics software using the exact three-dimensional geometry of the two cultivation systems. These models illustrate, for the first time, the local electric conditions required for cardiomyocyte field excitation and they confirmed the uniformity of the electrical field around the cell constructs. Bioreactor cultivation for only 4 days under perfusion and continuous electrical stimulus (74.4 mA/cm(2), 2 ms, bipolar, 1 Hz) promoted cell elongation and striation in the cell constructs and enhanced the expression level of Connexin-43, the gap junction protein responsible for cell-cell coupling. These results thus confirm the validity of the electrical field model in predicting the optimal electrical stimulation in a rather complex cultivation system, a perfusion bioreactor.',\n",

Therefore, results that COM describes a quasi-sinusoid curve. The main evidence against SDG theory is that a flattened COM trajectory increases muscle work and force requirements.

Expression of collagen I and III, as well as matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP- 2), tissue inhibitor of MMP- 2 (TIMP-2), and colligin were analyzed by RNase protection assay. In the absence of serum, 9% CMS increased the mRNA of collagen I by 1.70- fold and collagen III by 1.64-fold. This increase was prevented by the inhibition either of PKC or of tyrosine kinase but not of PKA. Inhibition of PKC or tyrosine kinase itself reduced the expression of collagen I and collagen III mRNA. The mRNA of MMP- 2, TIMP-2, and colligin showed the same tendency by stretch. Combined with 10% serum, 6% CMS reduced the mRNA of collagen I (0.62-fold) and collagen III ( 0.79fold). Inhibition of PKC or tyrosine kinase, but not of PKA, prevented the reduction of collagen I and collagen III mRNA in 10% serum. The results show that the response of fibroblasts to CMS depends on the serum concentration. At least two signaling pathways are involved in the stretch-induced ECM regulation.

       "  'GJK is one of the main methods for distance calculations between convex objects. In this article, the adaptation of GJK for deformable object collision detection is proposed. Although the original method is only suited for distance calculations, the proposed method is capable of nding the colliding triangle pairs between two cotinuously deforming virtual objects in real time. Furthermore, it handles all deformation types at no extra time cost and it allows the client application to add, or remove triangles from the considered object meshes at run time with no extra overhead for the collision detection. The proposed method is very exible in many aspects, making it an ideal choice for virtual reality and haptic applications.',\n",

With the advent of this technology, one can move from traditional user-only based trust management systems to user and platform-based trust management systems. In this paper, we propose a TCP based trust management and negotiation framework for better security decision making. In this regard, we outline a 3-stage property model that can be leveraged to define policies of different granularities. We then propose how Trust Policy Language (TPL) can be used to create compositions of properties. Finally, the paper discusses the different architectural design choices (such as push, pull and delegation based models) in negotiating trust using these policies and their implications in a distributed web service based environment.',\n",

As these robots are quite different as well in size, shape and in actuation principle it would be very time consuming and inefficient to build a computer and hardware architecture especially tailored to the specific robot. In this paper it will be described how common aspects in robot control can be identified and how a modular software framework and a respective computer architecture can be mapped to modular components on the hardware side.

       "  'The paper addresses the potential benefits of using a field programmable gate array (FPGA) as opposed to a traditional processor for music synthesis. The benefits result from the use of a cellular design, with each cell performing identical operations on its own state and the states of its neighbours. This gives advantages of design simplicity through inherent parallelism. A cellular model which has previously been used for music synthesis is the mass spring paradigm, and this model is implemented on an FPGA. On a sequential processor, the clock speed requirements of this model increase as N-2 (where N is the number of cells), whereas the clock speed requirement increases as Non an FPGA (if the cells can be made small enough that available area on the chip is not a constraint). To make the cells small enough, a bit-serial design was used. This work was performed to advocate the FPGA as a stand-alone live performance music synthesis platform, which has the potential to be reconfigured for example in performance, between synthesis techniques as different sound patches are selected. The paper considers in particular the mass-spring model, because it demonstrates the type of music synthesis technique for which FPGAs provide the greatest potential benefit. The capability to reconfigure combined with the high performance that can be achieved using cellular design suggests that the FPGA is an ideal platform for a live performance hardware music synthesiser, combining the flexibility of software with the speed of a custom ASIC.',\n",

       "  'Typically, commercially available standard-cell libraries consist of a large set of items, including cells optimized with respect to speed, area or power consumption. A large number of cells makes the synthesis process and the library maintenance quite demanding. By using a reduced set of properly-selected cells, such efforts can be reduced, without critically affecting performance. This paper introduces an innovative library-reduction strategy, based on a evolutionary algorithm, which allows for selecting an arbitrarily small subset of cells. Library compaction is strictly related to the features of the actual synthesis tool, and is tuned by means of a large set of benchmark circuits, so that it produces results suitable for general-purpose circuit design. Different technologies were accounted for, analyzing dependence of the area, time and power figures on the library cell count. Performance, with respect to full-size library synthesis, do not appreciably degrades, and in several cases actually improves. Synthesis time decreases and library maintenance and characterization tasks can thus be significantly reduced.',\n",
       "  \"A scalable hardware/software hybrid module called Ubidule- endowed with bio-inspired ontogenetic and epigenetic features is configured to run a neural networks simulation with developmental and evolvable capabilities. We simulated the activity of hierarchically organized spiking neural networks characterized by an initial developmental phase featuring cell death followed by spike timing dependent synaptic plasticity in presence of background noise. An upstream 'sensory' network received a spatiotemporally organized external input and downstream networks were activated only via the upstream network. Precise firing sequences, formed by recurrent patterns of spikes intervals above chance levels, were observed in all recording conditions, thus suggesting the build-up of a connectivity able to sustain temporal information processing. The activity of a Ubinet -a network of Ubidules- is analyzed by means of virtual electrodes that recorded neural signals similar to EEG. The analysis of these signals was compared with a small set of human recordings and revealed common patterns of shift in quadratic phase coupling. The results suggest some interpretations of changes and plasticity of functional interactions between cortical areas driven by external stimuli and by learning/cognitive paradigms.\",\n",

Accordingly, there has been much interest in studying the role of biomechanical forces in cell biology and pathophysiology. This has led to the introduction and even commercialization of many experimental devices. Many of the early devices were limited by the heterogeneity of deformation of cells cultivated in different locations of the culture plate membranes and were also attached with complicated technical/electronic efforts resulting in a restriction of the reproducibility of these devices. The objective of this study was to design and build a simple device to allow the application of dose-dependent homogeneous equibiaxial static stretch to cells cultured on flexible silicone membranes to investigate biological and biomedical questions. In addition, cultured neonatal rat atrial cardiomyocytes were stretched with the proposed device with different strain gradients. For the first time with this study we could demonstrate that stretch up to 21% caused dose-dependent changes in biological markers such as the calcineurin activity, modulatory calcineurin-interacting protein-1, voltage-gated potassium channel isoform 4.2, and voltage-gated K+ channel-interacting proteins-2 gene expression and transient outward potassium current densities but not the protein-to-DNA ratio and atrial natriuretic peptide mRNA. With both markers mentioned last, dose-dependent stretch alterations could only be achieved with stretch up to 13%. The simple and low-cost device presented here might be applied to a wide range of experimental settings in different fields of research.',\n",

As background, simple expressions are presented for the number of available key bits, as well as the number of bits that are secure from a close eavesdropper. Two methods for generating secret keys are analyzed in the context of MIMO channels and their mismatch rate and efficiency are derived.

       "  'Sensemaking involves turning circumstances into a situation that is comprehended explicitly in words and that serves as a springboard into action. In this paper we take the position that the concept of sensemaking fills important gaps in organizational theory. The seemingly transient nature of sensemaking belies its central role in the determination of human behavior, whether people are acting in formal organizations or elsewhere. Sensemaking is central because it is the primary site where meanings materialize that inform and constrain identity and action. The purpose of this paper is to take stock of the concept of sensemaking. We do so by pinpointing central features of sensemaking, some of which have been explicated but neglected, some of which have been assumed but not made explicit, some of which have changed in significance over time, and some of which have been missing all along or have gone awry. We sense joint enthusiasm to restate sensemaking in ways that make it more future oriented, more action oriented, more macro, more closely tied to organizing, meshed more boldly with identity, more visible, more behaviorally defined, less sedentary and backward looking, more infused with emotion and with issues of sensegiving and persuasion. These key enhancements provide a foundation upon which to build future studies that can strengthen the sensemaking perspective.',\n",

       "  'Economists often assume that a patent gives its owner a well-defined legal right to exclude others from practicing the invention described in the patent. In practice, however, the rights afforded to patent holders are highly uncertain. Under patent law, a patent is no guarantee of exclusion but more precisely a legal right to try to exclude. Since only 0.1% of all patents are litigated to trial, and since nearly half of fully litigated patents are declared invalid, this distinction is critical to understanding the economic impact of patents. The growing recognition among economists and legal scholars that patents are probabilistic property rights has significant implications for our understanding of patents in four important areas: (1) reform of the system by which patents are granted; (2) the legal treatment of patents in litigation; (3) the incentives of patent holders and alleged infringers to settle their disputes through licensing or cross-licensing agreements rather than litigate them to completion; and (4) the antitrust limits on agreements between rivals that settle actual or threatened patent litigation.',\n",

One such scheme is reciprocal channel key generation, where two nodes quantize reciprocal channel state information to generate keys.

This work presents a new MIMO measurement campaign performed in LOS and NLOS indoor environments that studies the correlation of the channel between legitimate users with the eavesdropper channel, revealing what key generation rates can be attained in practice and what fraction of generated key bits are safe from eavesdroppers. The effect of eavesdropper separation, number of antennas, eavesdropper advantage, and covariance separability are studied.',\n",

       "  'Both linear and nonlinear transmit precoding strategies based on accurate channel state information (CSI) can significantly increase available throughput in a multiuser wireless system. With propagation delay, infrequent channel updates, lag due to network layer overhead, and time-varying node position or environment characteristics, channel knowledge becomes outdated and CSI-based transmission schemes can experience severe performance degradation. This paper studies the performance of precoding techniques for the multiuser broadcast channel with outdated CSI at the transmitter. Traditional channel models as well as channel realizations measured by a wideband channel sounder are used in the analysis. With measured data from an outdoor urban environment, it is further shown the existence of stable subspaces upon which transmission is possible without any instantaneous CSI at the transmitter. Such transmissions allow for consistent performance curves at the cost of initial suboptimality compared to CSI-based schemes. Copyright (c) 2008.',\n",

This study models a dual-polarized MIMO channel using the Kronecker and Weichselberger models for two different indoor environments. The author's contribution here is based on a measurement campaign employing dual-polarized 8x8 patch arrays, and is analyzed at 2.4 and 5.2 GHz, where measurements were performed in an office building and an industrial environment. The average capacities attained from the measured data is compared with that of the models. Although the Weichselberger model performs better than the Kronecker model in both environments and at both frequencies, both models are found to underestimate the measured data. The Kronecker model is known to perform poorly for large antenna sizes and the performance of the Weichselberger model can be attributed to certain parts of the channel not fading enough.\",\n",
       "  'This work explores the performance of a multiple-input multiple-output broadcast channel where both the transmitter and receivers have outdated channel knowledge due to node motion or other time-variations in the communication channel. A performance analysis based on measured channel responses reveals significant throughput degradation for optimal linear and nonlinear precoding strategies unless the channel state information (CSI) is frequently fed back to the transmitter. The paper then develops a linear beamforming precoding strategy based on channel distribution information in the form of a full spatial correlation matrix for each user. This algorithm is shown to provide highly stable communication, with a throughput that is higher than that for optimal precoders operating on outdated CSI, in a time-variant environment, indicating that this approach can operate with significantly reduced feedback frequency. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates the use of the well-known Kronecker and Weichselberger models to parameterize the full correlation matrix to enable further reduction in the amount of feedback data required for implementation of the new beamforming technique.',\n",

These include expansions from software into general culture through 'Free Culture' movements and, more recently, expansions from software into hardware and design. This article provides a critical perspective on the democratic potential of these broader 'open' contribution structures by examining how open source contributions to both software and hardware increase the opportunities for democratic participation in production, governance and knowledge exchange. By analysing attempts to 'open source' the sharing of hardware designs, it also notes the limitations of this democratization. The insights developed in the article nuance the relationship between open source cultures and commercial and market structures, identifying how the generative opportunities created by certain aspects of open source contribution structures increase the potential for democratizing production of communication tools, but also how incongruities across different open-source cultures and communities of practice limit the democratic potential of these processes.\",\n",

       "  'In this paper, we assess the economic viability of innovation by producers relative to two increasingly important alternative models: innovations by single-user individuals or firms and open collaborative innovation. We analyze the design costs and architectures and communication costs associated with each model. We conclude that both innovation by individual users and open collaborative innovation increasingly compete with and may displace producer innovation in many parts of the economy. We explain why this represents a paradigm shift with respect to innovation research, policy making, and practice. We discuss important implications and offer suggestions for further research.',\n",
       "  \"This article examines the open paradigm in design research and introduces a new conceptualization for 'open design' and a three-layer framework to demonstrate the degrees of openness in design practices. The conceptualization comprises all stages in the design process, ranging from need-finding to the openness of the design documents and the data gathered during the design process, and the commercialization of the end-product. The aspects of the product and the process merge in this framework, intertwining the aspects of technical, legal and commercial openness. Finally, the article proposes a research agenda for open design. The article builds on an extensive literature review about studies on 'open' in design: open-source software, open hardware, and participatory methods in design, such as co-design and participatory design, and user-engagement methods such as crowdsourcing and co-creation.\",\n",
       "  \"This paper presents the development and testing of an open and flexible embedded system applied to positioning and telecontrol (OFESAPO) for outdoor applications. The system is composed of a control center (CC) and a set of remote terminal units (RTUs); the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 60870-5 series has been chosen for communication among them. This is a standard protocol of real-time telecontrol applications. The CC is a personal computer, and the RTUs are based on open hardware and software. The RTU hardware is an embedded system, i.e., a system-on-chip-type design using field-programmable gate array that has been programmed with the open-core LEON running Linux operating system. For prototyping, the GR-XC3S-1500 board has been used. As there is no open source code available for the IEC standard protocols, an open source code has also been implemented. Hence, both the hardware and the software are open source in OFESAPO. Several tests have been made to show the system's limitations and the suitability for real-time applications. A prototype has also been tested in a real environment, where the real position of two moving RTUs was shown by a CC using Google Map.\",\n",
       "  'Synchrophasor measurement is increasingly becoming a standard tool of the electrical power systems engineer and is attracting much interest in the research community due to the novel new methods and techniques it offers for observing and controlling the power system. A common difficulty in the development of Synchrophasor based technology is the closed environment in which the measurement algorithms and processes governing the operation of Phasor Measurement Units, PMUs, are developed. While most PMUs will support the relevant IEEE standards for Synchrophasor measurement, where transient or dynamic operation is concerned it would be useful to have detailed knowledge of the mathematical transforms and indeed any limitations of the measurement hardware. This can be especially important in developing new protection systems utilizing Synchrophasors, when confidence in the system rests on consistent performance between devices over a long period of service, including device upgrades. The \"OpenPMU\" described in this paper intends to settle some of these concerns by defining and developing a research orientated platform for Synchrophasor algorithm and application development.',\n",

       "  \"Typical experiments in psychological and neurophysiological settings often require the accurate control of multiple input and output signals. These signals are often generated or recorded via computer software and/or external dedicated hardware. Dedicated hardware is usually very expensive and requires additional software to control its behavior. In the present article, I present some accuracy tests on a low-cost and open-source I/O board (Arduino family) that may be useful in many lab environments. One of the strengths of Arduinos is the possibility they afford to load the experimental script on the board's memory and let it run without interfacing with computers or external software, thus granting complete independence, portability, and accuracy. Furthermore, a large community has arisen around the Arduino idea and offers many hardware add-ons and hundreds of free scripts for different projects. Accuracy tests show that Arduino boards may be an inexpensive tool for many psychological and neurophysiological labs.\",\n",
       "  \"Humanoid robotics is a field of a great research interest nowadays. This work implements a low-cost teleoperated system to control a humanoid robot, as a first step for further development and study of human motion and walking. A human suit is built, consisting of 8 sensors, 6 resistive linear potentiometers on the lower extremities and 2 digital accelerometers for the arms. The goal is to replicate the suit movements in a small humanoid robot. The data from the sensors is wirelessly transmitted via two ZigBee RF configurable modules installed on each device: the robot and the suit. Replicating the suit movements requires a robot stability control module to prevent falling down while executing different actions involving knees flexion. This is carried out via a feedback control system with an accelerometer placed on the robot's back. The measurement from this sensor is filtered using Kalman. In addition, a two input fuzzy algorithm controlling five servo motors regulates the robot balance. The humanoid robot is controlled by a medium capacity processor and a low computational cost is achieved for executing the different algorithms. Both hardware and software of the system are based on open platforms. The successful experiments carried out validate the implementation of the proposed teleoperated system.\",\n",

       "  'The fusion of Biomedical Technology, Informatics and Medical Decision-making into the modern Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS), as well as the population ageing and the escalation of hospital costs are the driving forces for adopting decentralized systems of health care provision. One of the main problems arising with decentralized health care provision, such as Home Care, is the discontinuity of medical care. This discontinuity appears not only in medical data transfer, but also in the quality of medical supervision. In order to accommodate for the lack of sufficient medical supervision in Home-Care environment, we have developed low-cost prototype solution for monitoring basic physiological parameters. The implemented architecture is employing wearable biomedical signal acquisition modules, utilizing \"off the shelf\" technologies in order to minimize cost. These modules transmit the acquired vital signs through a wireless link to a laptop computer.

Their design, optimized for a wide range of radio astronomical applications, is presented. Developed for operation with the GREAT far infrared heterodyne spectrometer on-board SOFIA, the eXtended bandwidth FFTS (XFFTS) offers a high instantaneous bandwidth of 2.5GHz with 88.5 kHz spectral resolution and has been in routine operation during SOFIA's Basic Science since July 2011. We discuss the advanced field programmable gate array (FPGA) signal processing pipeline, with an optimized multi-tap polyphase filter bank algorithm that provides a nearly loss-less time-to-frequency data conversion with significantly reduced frequency scallop and fast sidelobe fall-off. Our digital spectrometers have been proven to be extremely reliable and robust, even under the harsh environmental conditions of an airborne observatory, with Allan-variance stability times of several 1000 s. An enhancement of the present 2.5GHz XFFTS will duplicate the number of spectral channels (64k), offering spectroscopy with even better resolution during Cycle 1 observations.\",\n",
       "  'The article investigates how users in the Czech wireless network community invented a technology for sending data over visible, red light. For five years, this was the most affordable method for connecting computers. The development of this technology was guided by the idea that it should be controlled by its users. With reference to this experiment, it is argued that a shared ethical and/or political vision can contribute to the establishment of norms within user communities encouraging their members to share information with each other. Thus, it is suggested that ethical and political convictions can be crucial for enabling collective innovation processes. This highlighting of normativity is intended as a complement to the common premise in Innovation Studies that users innovate to satisfy unfulfilled needs. In opposition to this view, it is argued that the needs of users are not a constant but something which emerge together with the transformation of the user community and the technology in question. Particular focus is placed on the tension between, on one hand, the norms and ethical-political motives of the user community, and, on the other hand, the needs satisfied through product development, both stemming from the same innovation process.',\n",

A new emerging group of these devices is the wearable devices, and the wireless sensor networks are a good way to integrate them in the IoT concept and bring new experiences to the daily life activities. In this paper, we present an everyday life application involving a WSN as the base of a novel context-awareness sports scenario, where physiological parameters are measured and sent to the WSN by wearable devices. Applications with several hardware components introduce the problem of heterogeneity in the network. In order to integrate different hardware platforms and to introduce a service-oriented semantic middleware solution into a single application, we propose the use of an enterprise service bus (ESB) as a bridge for guaranteeing interoperability and integration of the different environments, thus introducing a semantic added value needed in the world of IoT-based systems. This approach places all the data acquired (e. g., via internet data access) at application developers disposal, opening the system to new user applications. The user can then access the data through a wide variety of devices (smartphones, tablets, and computers) and operating systems (Android, iOS, Windows, Linux, etc.).',\n",

A careful study relying on nonstationary statistical modeling and data mining allows us to first model the time evolution of the dynamics of movements with Velo'v, that is mostly cyclostationary over the week with nonstationary evolutions over larger time-scales, and second to disentangle the spatial patterns to understand and visualize the flows of Velo'v bicycles in the city.

       "  \"Over the last five decades, progress in neural recording techniques has allowed the number of simultaneously recorded neurons to double approximately every 7 years, mimicking Moore's law. Such exponential growth motivates us to ask how data analysis techniques are affected by progressively larger numbers of recorded neurons. Traditionally, neurons are analyzed independently on the basis of their tuning to stimuli or movement. Although tuning curve approaches are unaffected by growing numbers of simultaneously recorded neurons, newly developed techniques that analyze interactions between neurons become more accurate and more complex as the number of recorded neurons increases. Emerging data analysis techniques should consider both the computational costs and the potential for more accurate models associated with this exponential growth of the number of recorded neurons.\",\n",
       "  'Dual sideband (2SB) receivers are well suited for the spectral observation of complex astronomical signals over a wide frequency range. They are extensively used in radio astronomy, their main advantages being to avoid spectral confusion and to diminish effective system temperature by a factor 2 with respect to double sideband (DSB) receivers. Using available millimeter-wave analog technology, wideband 2SB receivers generally obtain sideband rejection ratios (SRR) of 10-15 dB, insufficient for a number of astronomical applications. We report here the design and implementation of an FPGA-based sideband separating FFT spectrometer. A 4 GHz analog front end was built to test the design and measure sideband rejection. The setup uses a 2SB front end architecture, except that the mixer outputs are directly digitized before the IF hybrid, using two 8 bit ADCs sampling at 1 GSPS. The IF hybrid is implemented on the FPGA together with a set of calibration vectors that, properly chosen, compensate for the analog front end amplitude and phase imbalances. The calibrated receiver exhibits a sideband rejection ratio in excess of 40 dB for the entire 2 GHz RF bandwidth.',\n",

       "  'We are entering a new era in our ability to modify and edit the genomes of model organisms. Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) opened the door to the first custom nuclease-targeted genome engineering in the late 1990s. However, ZFNs remained out of reach for most research labs because of the difficulty of production, high costs, and modest efficacy in many applications. Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) were built upon a DNA binding system discovered in a group of plant bacterial pathogens and broadened custom nuclease technology, showing significant improvements in both targeting flexibility and efficiency. Perhaps most importantly, TALENs are open source and easy to produce, providing zebrafish laboratories around the world with affordable tools that can be made in-house rapidly, at low cost, and with reliably high activity. Now a new system for targeted genome engineering derived from the CRISPR/Cas system in eubacteria and archaea promises to simplify this process further. Together, these tools will help overcome many of the bottlenecks that have constrained gene targeting in zebrafish, paving the way for advanced genome engineering applications in this model teleost.',\n",

It is shown that this method is suitable for implementation in the intrinsically distributed computing environment found in wireless smart sensor networks (WSSNs). The HHT-based decentralized data processing is, then, programmed and implemented on the Crossbow IRIS mote sensor platform.

To achieve this, a GUI was developed to randomly create missions of different sizes and complexities. The GUI offers the developer the choice of automatically generating such missions, edit them and/or create them. The robots may be programmed by various solving algorithms to complete the course and find a solution. The advantage of this approach is that it offers environment and robot real-time merging, robot performance tracking and rapid (on-the-fly) algorithms development. In this paper, the rescuing robot will follow an embedded Wall-Following algorithm.',\n",

A need has been identified for an open-source alternative to commercial PMU devices tailored to the needs of the university researcher and for enabling the development of new synchrophasor instruments from this foundation. OpenPMU achieves this through open-source hardware design specifications and software source code, allowing duplicates of the OpenPMU to be fabricated under open-source licenses. This paper presents the OpenPMU device based on the Labview development environment. The device is performance tested according to the IEEE C37.118.1 standard. Compatibility with the IEEE C37.118.2 messaging format is achieved through middleware which is readily adaptable to other PMU projects or applications. Improvements have been made to the original design to increase its flexibility.

Doing-it-together (DIT) and the idea of community and shared experiences are at the root of DIY practice. This article discusses how the workshop and the event have become central to practitioners working in the field of DIY. Collective instrument building, the concept of the living installation, and performance are viewed as a holistic event. Some specific examples of the author's work known as Dirty Electronics are considered, where emphasis is placed upon experience rather than the 'something to take home' factor. These include the following works: ICA Solder a Score, Noise Shadow, Still and Cut & Thrust. Composing 'outside' electronics is regarded as a method for revealing processes that can be represented in other areas of the work beyond sound-generating circuits. The article also looks at how building circuits and sound devices acts as a way to create a tabula rasa, and how the idea of delegated performance, where instruments are played by 'non-experts', serves to establish a naive approach and authenticity in performance. Through the sharing of information online and in workshops, the DIY community has become knowledgeable, which has resulted in a community 'full of experts' and the growth of custom-designed circuits. The rise of discrete hand-held music players, such as the Buddha Machine, and the boutique synthesiser are also discussed, and the physical artefact and sound object are seen as a vehicle for the dissemination of ideas.

       "  'A new method for conducting laboratory measurements of the velocities and polarizations of compressional and shear waves in rock samples uses a laser Doppler interferometer (LDI). LDI can measure the particle velocity of a small (0.03 mm(2)) element of the surface of the sample along the direction of the laser beam. By measuring the particle velocity of the same surface element in three linearly independent directions and then transforming those velocities to Cartesian coordinates, three orthogonal components of the particle-velocity vector are obtained. Thus, LDI can be used as a localized three-component (3C) receiver of ultrasonic waves, and, together with a piezoelectric transducer as a source, it can simulate a 3C seismic experiment in the laboratory. Performing such 3C measurements at various locations on the surface of the sample produces a 3C seismogram, which can be used to separate the P-wave and two S-waves and to find the polarizations and traveltimes of those waves. Then, the elasticity tensor of the medium can be obtained by minimizing the misfit between measured and predicted polarizations and traveltimes. Computation of the polarizations and traveltimes of body waves inside a sample with a given elasticity tensor is based on the Christoffel equation. The predicted polarizations on the surface then are obtained using the anisotropic Zoeppritz equations. The type of velocity measured (phase or group velocity) depends on the acquisition geometry and the material properties. This is taken into account in the inversion procedure.

       "  'Electrophysiological recordings from ensembles of neurons in behaving mice are a central tool in the study of neural circuits. Despite the widespread use of chronic electrophysiology, the precise positioning of recording electrodes required for high-quality recordings remains a challenge, especially in behaving mice. The complexity of available drive mechanisms, combined with restrictions on implant weight tolerated by mice, limits current methods to recordings from no more than 4-8 electrodes in a single target area. We developed a highly miniaturized yet simple drive design that can be used to independently position 16 electrodes with up to 64 channels in a package that weighs ~2 g. This advance over current designs is achieved by a novel spring-based drive mechanism that reduces implant weight and complexity. The device is easy to build and accommodates arbitrary spatial arrangements of electrodes. Multiple optical fibers can be integrated into the recording array and independently manipulated in depth. Thus, our novel design enables precise optogenetic control and highly parallel chronic recordings of identified single neurons throughout neural circuits in mice.',\n",
       "  \"Given that open innovation web-based platforms (OIPs) allow for the collaboration of individuals and companies, this paper focuses on exploring the motivations for participating and collaborating in OIPs. Extant studies are conflicting, especially with respect to the importance of the monetary reward as a motivation. Moreover, literature supports our premise from the individuals' motivations analysis viewpoint, but not from the companies' perspective. Finally, literature does not consider the differences related to different members and to different phases of the innovation process. First, we base the literature on open innovation on the Internet (crowdsourcing, peer production and open source) to identify the potential motivations. We then deeply analyse 116 OIPs to determine if the motivations can be a function of the phase of innovation and the dependency on members. We show that the design of the motivational system should take into consideration the different stages of the innovation process and that the OIPs should consider moving from 'work place' logic to 'social place' logic.\",\n",

The multidisciplinary nature of such systems makes it challenging to give students exposure to and experience in all their facets. This paper proposes a generic architecture, containing multiple processors, that allows easy integration of custom and/or predefined peripherals. The architecture allows students to explore both the hardware and software issues associated with real-time and embedded systems. Furthermore, the architecture can be extended to train students in advanced concepts in embedded multiprocessor systems. This generic architecture has been used for two courses at the National University of Singapore-one on real-time embedded systems and the other emphasizing the hardware aspects of embedded systems. The project in the real-time embedded systems course has students develop a five-a-side soccer system on multiple field-programmable gate array (FPGA) boards using embedded processors. In the embedded hardware design course project, students use an embedded processor-based system to perform decryption of a block encrypted image, accelerated through a custom co-processor. The use of displays gives students a visual/interactive experience and a sense of accomplishment, while reinforcing the theoretical concepts.

A robot can provide assistance with these tasks by moving its end effector to poses near the care-receiver's body. However, perceiving and maneuvering around the care-receiver's body can be challenging due to a variety of issues, including convoluted geometry, compliant materials, body motion, hidden surfaces, and the object upon which the body is resting (e.g., a wheelchair or bed). Using geometric simulations, we first show that an assistive robot can achieve a much larger percentage of end-effector poses near the care-receiver's body if its arm is allowed to make contact. Second, we present a novel system with a custom controller and whole-arm tactile sensor array that enables a Willow Garage PR2 to regulate contact forces across its entire arm while moving its end effector to a commanded pose. We then describe tests with two people with motor impairments, one of whom used the system to grasp and pull a blanket over himself and to grab a cloth and wipe his face, all while in bed at his home. Finally, we describe a study with eight able-bodied users in which they used the system to place objects near their bodies.

       "  'The work presented in this paper is part of a larger initiative to develop a Geo-based Load Forecasting (GLF) methodology for distribution master planning in South Africa. Part of the planning process, is forecasting the peak load for a geographical area with a given load class composition. This forecast is used to plan the capacity and timeline of infrastructure to service that area. In this paper, an overview of the GLF peak load estimation technique is provided as background. A Monte Carlo simulation based approach to evaluate the accuracy of this method was developed and is presented. Using the simulation, an evaluation of the current method and load library was completed and the results show that the current method significantly under-estimates the peak load. This can be attributed to changes in the load profile shapes of customers since 2007 when the current load profile library was derived, as well as simplifications in the derivation of the customer load behaviour. Specifically, the differences between the load behaviours of customers within a specific load class is ignored. An enhancement to the geo-based method is presented and compares well with simulated results across different customer classes and load aggregation periods. This improvement reflects the customer load behaviour more accurately and can readily be incorporated as part of the distribution master planning process.',\n",

DlYbio combines an open source ethos, with a DIY will to do things and the joy to mess with biological matter. As biohacking is about de-composing and re-composing things, DIYbio takes on a particular approach to the making of the new and to the making of futures that this paper explores. Inspired by Heidegger's notion of the thing, I suggest that differing from institutionalized forms of biology, DlYbio produces things rather than techno-objects. I go into this point by first situating DIYbio in relation to synthetic biology and other instutionalised forms of biology. To explore how DlYbio takes on a particular approach to the making of the new, I look at a number of things that DlYbio groups have projected, designed and realized. I suggest that DlYbio combines a sort of individual craftiness and self-determination to do things with a praxis in which things are always in the making, waiting for the next realization. DIYbio take on an approach to the making of things and futures that is immediate and mundane.

Whilst this form of media access control brings several timeliness benefits, studies have also illustrated negative effects on transmission reliability. This paper extends the 'window transmission' technique which was recently proposed by the authors to help overcome this problem in TDMA-based networks to include the effects of correlated (burst) errors. This paper employs a simple Markov model to describe burst error behaviors in a CAN network, and the model is used to develop an algorithm for calculating TDMA slot sizes which aim to provide prespecified statistical guarantees of message delivery. Computational results are presented which indicate that the technique can reduce the amount of bandwidth needed for specified reliability levels by a significant factor when compared to the use of message duplicates. The paper is concluded with an empirical study which provides further supportive evidence for the described technique.\",\n",

This paper presents a power saving scheme to improve the power efficiency of the MSSR by dynamically adapting the size of its internal architecture to the offered load to reduce power needs. The off-line problem is defined as a mixed integer linear programming optimization model, shown to be NP-hard. We propose a differential on-line heuristic to solve the optimization problem when the traffic load changes. The heuristic avoids the complete MSSR reconfiguration of the optimal off-line solution that may lead to forwarding delay increase or service interruption. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed on-line algorithm, that gracefully modifies the internal MSSR configuration, preserves the load proportional power demand characteristics of the optimal off-line solution.',\n",

Twenty students engaged in this 2-h weekly lecture over the 14 weeks of the Autumn 2011 semester, complemented by a weekly 2-h laboratory session with the ETHZ haptic paddle.

       "  \"Although several brain regions show significant specialization, higher functions such as cross-modal information integration, abstract reasoning and conscious awareness are viewed as emerging from interactions across distributed functional networks. Analytical approaches capable of capturing the properties of such networks can therefore enhance our ability to make inferences from functional MRI, electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography data. Graph theory is a branch of mathematics that focuses on the formal modelling of networks and offers a wide range of theoretical tools to quantify specific features of network architecture (topology) that can provide information complementing the anatomical localization of areas responding to given stimuli or tasks (topography). Explicit modelling of the architecture of axonal connections and interactions among areas can furthermore reveal peculiar topological properties that are conserved across diverse biological networks, and highly sensitive to disease states. The field is evolving rapidly, partly fuelled by computational developments that enable the study of connectivity at fine anatomical detail and the simultaneous interactions among multiple regions. Recent publications in this area have shown that graph-based modelling can enhance our ability to draw causal inferences from functional MRI experiments, and support the early detection of disconnection and the modelling of pathology spread in neurodegenerative disease, particularly Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, neurophysiological studies have shown that network topology has a profound link to epileptogenesis and that connectivity indices derived from graph models aid in modelling the onset and spread of seizures. Graph-based analyses may therefore significantly help understand the bases of a range of neurological conditions.

This reflects the assumption that the mapping between sensor signal patterns and activity classes is known at design-time. This cannot be guaranteed in mobile and pervasive computing, where unpredictable changes can often occur in open-ended environments. Run-time adaptation can address these issues. We introduce and formalize a data processing architecture extending current approaches that allows for a wide range of realizations of adaptive activity recognition systems.

Analysis of these performance gains is based on actual data throughput and channel-state measurements of an airborne 4x4 MIMO-enabled orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system. Practical realization of these performance gains with a coded-OFDM wideband system was accomplished through airborne field trials across multiple flight profiles. We show through experimental validation that average MIMO throughput gains in excess of 2x can be achieved relative to a SISO system. These field trials also indicate that MIMO processing can deliver a 1.6x increase in the range of the link. Additionally, if channel-state information (CSI) is available at the transmitter - which enables MIMO eigen beamforming - the average throughput gain can be further increased to 4.5x and the link range can be increased by as much as 3.6x. It is also shown that for a 4x4 MIMO system to deliver the same throughput performance as a conventional SISO system in an air-to-ground environment, a relative TX power savings of up to 21 dB can be realized.',\n",

We propose a new means to mitigate the effects of NBTI on SRAM-based register files, which are particularly vulnerable due to their small structure size and are under continuous voltage stress for prolonged intervals. The conducted results from our technology simulator demonstrate the severity of NBTI effects on the SRAM cells - especially when process variation is taken into account. Based on the presented analysis, we show that NBTI stress in different registers needs to be tackled using different strategies corresponding to their access patterns. To this end, we propose to selectively increase the resilience of individual registers against NBTI. Our technique balances the gate voltage stress of the two PMOS transistors of an SRAM cell such that both are under stress for approximately the same amount of time during operation thereby minimizing the deleterious effects of NBTI. We present mitigation implementations in both hardware and in software along with the incurred overhead. Through a wide range of applications we can show that our technique reduces the NBTI-induced reliability degradation by 35% on average. This is 22% better than current State-of-the-Art.',\n",

Building on this comparison it is argued that technological determinism does not always lead to political resignation, but can also serve as a foundation for collective action.\",\n",

       "  'This paper proposes two methods for UAV translational velocity estimation based on onboard sensing only. Spherical image measurements provided by a single onboard camera along with IMU data consist the main information feeding the estimators. The first algorithm consists of a nonlinear observer, designed using Lyapunov synthesis, while the second is based on the Unscented Kalman filtering technique. Differently with respect to existing approaches, the velocity is directly estimated from the onboard image without the need to fully estimate the vehicle 3D pose. The low computational requirement makes the proposed techniques suitable for applications where the execution time is of prominent importance even if no powerful hardware is available, as it is the case with UAV systems. Experimental results validate the algorithms, and this with the use of only four image features.',\n",

The homogeneity of surface strain distribution across the cell culture substrate was confirmed with ARAMIS deformation analysis. The proliferation marker, Ki-67, detected in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and 3-[4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide cytotoxicity assay performed on human atrial fibroblasts confirmed biocompatibility of this novel device. Cyclic stretch treatment for 24 h resulted in the perpendicular alignment of human atrial fibroblasts. An electrical stimulation system containing carbon electrodes was characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and charge injection/recovery studies, which indicated that increased corrosive reactions were associated with a higher input voltage and prolonged pulse duration. Field stimulation delivered through this system could induce rhythmic contractions in adult rat ventricular myocytes, with contractile characteristics similar to those paced in a standard field stimulation chamber. In conclusion, this bioreactor provides a novel tool to study the interaction between physical stimulation and cardiac cell physiology.',\n",

       "  'A cognitive mobile robot must be able to autonomously solve the three complex problems of navigating: where it is, where it is going and how it is going to get there. The first is addressed by techniques for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). The next stage of navigating is to plan a path to a goal, which is often achieved by learning techniques due to the scale of search required. Commonly, the localisation and mapping stage is separated from path planning stage, with the function not of interest being considered ideal in order to simplify the problem (similarly, the goal is often predetermined by an external agent, such as a human operator specifying a location to reach). This work integrates the planning with the localisation and mapping in order to investigate the benefits of considering these aspects together (rather than as a separate functions as is often assumed). Firstly, experiments on real-robots show decreased localisation error in this approach (1.8 mm +/- 0.41 mm to 1.2 mm +/- 0.26 mm). Secondly, the number of steps to goal has concurrently been reduced (13.4 steps to 11.8 steps). This work is novel in the integration of evolutionary computation planning techniques with SLAM. It also has enabled the opportunity for rule-sharing between heterogeneous robots and the inclusion of action policies in SLAM filter updates.',\n",

       "  'Among various approaches to eye tracking systems, light-reflection based systems with non-imaging sensors, e.g., photodiodes or phototransistors, are known to have relatively low complexity; yet, they provide moderately accurate estimation of the point of gaze. In this paper, a low-computational approach on gaze estimation is proposed using the Eye Touch system, which is a light-reflection based eye tracking system, previously introduced by the authors. Based on the physical implementation of Eye Touch, the sensor measurements are now utilized in low-computational least-squares algorithms to estimate arbitrary gaze directions, unlike the existing light reflection-based systems, including the initial Eye Touch implementation, where only limited predefined regions were distinguished. The system also utilizes an effective pattern classification algorithm to be able to perform left, right, and double clicks based on respective eye winks with significantly high accuracy. In order to avoid accuracy problems for sensitive sensor biasing hardware, a robust custom microcontroller-based data acquisition system is developed. Consequently, the physical size and cost of the overall Eye Touch system are considerably reduced while the power efficiency is improved. The results of the experimental analysis over numerous subjects clearly indicate that the proposed eye tracking system can classify eye winks with 98% accuracy, and attain an accurate gaze direction with an average angular error of about 0.93. Due to its lightweight structure, competitive accuracy and low-computational requirements relative to video-based eye tracking systems, the proposed system is a promising human-computer interface for both stationary and mobile eye tracking applications.',\n",

In fact, the properties of real world powerline channels are substantially different from those commonly exhibited by their wireless counterparts, so that standard methods for wireless channel sounding cannot be adapted to a powerline scenario. In this paper, after providing some general design guidelines for powerline channel sounding, a detailed description of a FPGA-based implementation of a wideband powerline channel sounder is provided. Such a tool is based on low cost hardware and is flexible, since it can be easily customized to user needs using a set of simple graphical user interfaces.

Analyzing this fast growing, large data set requires efficient and reliable detection routines. Currently most meteor echo routines search for underdense meteor trails, often discarding overdense and nonspecular meteor trails. This is because their main purpose is the study of mesospheric winds. But the study of meteor flux requires the unique identification of each type of meteor reflections. In this paper, a multilayer radar detection and classification algorithm is proposed to correctly identify multiple types of meteor trail reflections. The process consists of two steps. The first step is based on the time-frequency waveform detector. In this step, we start by selecting low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values in order to detect all types of radar echoes; however, a high probability offalse alarm is often produced. In the second step, several features from the detected echoes in step one are extracted and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier is constructed to further classify these echoes. The algorithm was tested using data collected from a 50-MHz radar stationed near Salinas, Puerto Rico, on April 5, 1998. A total of 270 detected echoes were labeled as underdense, overdense, nonspecular, other ionospheric echoes, and noise. We used 50% of the labeled echoes as training samples and divided the rest 50% testing samples as 10 subsets for testing. This technique successfully classified about 85% of the testing samples. Details concerning implementation, feature extraction, and data visualization are presented and discussed.',\n",

One of the main problems arising with decentralized health care provision, such as Home Care, is the discontinuity of medical care. This discontinuity appears not only in medical data transfer, but also in the quality of medical supervision. In order to accommodate for the lack of sufficient medical supervision in Home-Care environment, we have developed low-cost prototype solution for monitoring basic physiological parameters.

       "  \"Humanoid robotics is a field of a great research interest nowadays. This work implements a low-cost teleoperated system to control a humanoid robot, as a first step for further development and study of human motion and walking. A human suit is built, consisting of 8 sensors, 6 resistive linear potentiometers on the lower extremities and 2 digital accelerometers for the arms. The goal is to replicate the suit movements in a small humanoid robot. The data from the sensors is wirelessly transmitted via two ZigBee RF configurable modules installed on each device: the robot and the suit. Replicating the suit movements requires a robot stability control module to prevent falling down while executing different actions involving knees flexion. This is carried out via a feedback control system with an accelerometer placed on the robot's back. The measurement from this sensor is filtered using Kalman. In addition, a two input fuzzy algorithm controlling five servo motors regulates the robot balance. The humanoid robot is controlled by a medium capacity processor and a low computational cost is achieved for executing the different algorithms. Both hardware and software of the system are based on open platforms. The successful experiments carried out validate the implementation of the proposed teleoperated system.\",\n",

Thus, it is suggested that ethical and political convictions can be crucial for enabling collective innovation processes. This highlighting of normativity is intended as a complement to the common premise in Innovation Studies that users innovate to satisfy unfulfilled needs. In opposition to this view, it is argued that the needs of users are not a constant but something which emerge together with the transformation of the user community and the technology in question.

In order to achieve adequate cooling, phenomena like Joule Thomson, Peltier or the thermal tube principle are now employed. Correct Central processing unit (CPU) functioning imposes use of efficient heat exchangers. Experimental investigations showed a different behavior for heat radiators, depending on the flow channels configuration and chosen route for the air circulated by the system fan. For the present study, the adopted mathematical model takes into consideration several aspects, such as flow regime, air viscosity, microchannel physical parameters and characteristics of CPU-cooler interface material. Temperature variations in CPU area were analytically calculated starting from a Holman model, completed by resolution of Fourier equations for a stationary unidirectional regime, with parallel flat walls, and internal heat sources. The CPU was assumed to generate all the heat. A CPU cooling system behavior was investigated using a heat transfer model, created in ANSYS, for the above-mentioned conditions.',\n",
       "  \"Given that open innovation web-based platforms (OIPs) allow for the collaboration of individuals and companies, this paper focuses on exploring the motivations for participating and collaborating in OIPs. Extant studies are conflicting, especially with respect to the importance of the monetary reward as a motivation. Moreover, literature supports our premise from the individuals' motivations analysis viewpoint, but not from the companies' perspective. Finally, literature does not consider the differences related to different members and to different phases of the innovation process. First, we base the literature on open innovation on the Internet (crowdsourcing, peer production and open source) to identify the potential motivations. We then deeply analyse 116 OIPs to determine if the motivations can be a function of the phase of innovation and the dependency on members. We show that the design of the motivational system should take into consideration the different stages of the innovation process and that the OIPs should consider moving from 'work place' logic to 'social place' logic.\",\n",
       "  'This study sought to determine the validity of a new system for assessing the displacement and average velocity within machine-based resistance training exercise using the Chronojump System. The new design is based on a contact bar and a simple, low-cost mechanism that detects the conductivity of electrical potentials with a precision chronograph. This system allows coaches to assess velocity to control the strength training process. A validation study was performed by assessing the concentric phase parameters of a leg press exercise. Output time data from the Chronojump System in combination with the preestablished range of movement was compared with data from a position sensor connected to a Biopac System. A subset of 87 actions from 11 professional tennis players was recorded and, using the two methods, average velocity and displacement variables in the same action were compared. A t-test for dependent samples and a correlation analysis were undertaken. The r value derived from the correlation between the Biopac System and the contact Chronojump System was >0.94 for all measures of displacement and velocity on all loads (p < 0.01). The Effect Size (ES) was 0.18 in displacement and 0.14 in velocity and ranged from 0.09 to 0.31 and from 0.07 to 0.34, respectively. The magnitude of the difference between the two methods in all parameters and the correlation values provided certain evidence of validity of the Chronojump System to assess the average displacement velocity of loads in a resistance training machine.',\n",
       "  'Reliable obstacle avoidance is a key to navigating with UAVs in the close vicinity of static and dynamic obstacles. Wheel-based mobile robots are often equipped with 2D or 3D laser range finders that cover the 2D workspace sufficiently accurate and at a high rate. Micro UAV platforms operate in a 3D environment, but the restricted payload prohibits the use of fast state-of-the-art 3D sensors. Thus, perception of small obstacles is often only possible in the vicinity of the UAV and a fast collision avoidance system is necessary. We propose a reactive collision avoidance system based on artificial potential fields, that takes the special dynamics of UAVs into account by predicting the influence of obstacles on the estimated trajectory in the near future using a learned motion model. Experimental evaluation shows that the prediction leads to smoother trajectories and allows to navigate collision-free through passageways.',\n",

Collective instrument building, the concept of the living installation, and performance are viewed as a holistic event. Some specific examples of the author's work known as Dirty Electronics are considered, where emphasis is placed upon experience rather than the 'something to take home' factor.

Composing 'outside' electronics is regarded as a method for revealing processes that can be represented in other areas of the work beyond sound-generating circuits. The article also looks at how building circuits and sound devices acts as a way to create a tabula rasa, and how the idea of delegated performance, where instruments are played by 'non-experts', serves to establish a naive approach and authenticity in performance. Through the sharing of information online and in workshops, the DIY community has become knowledgeable, which has resulted in a community 'full of experts' and the growth of custom-designed circuits. The rise of discrete hand-held music players, such as the Buddha Machine, and the boutique synthesiser are also discussed, and the physical artefact and sound object are seen as a vehicle for the dissemination of ideas. Finally, the question is asked: 'In DIY practice, where does the authentic document of the work lie?'\",\n",

The results of the clinical trial show that the system is able to reduce the number of falls on a geriatric ward. Next steps are the design of a specialized sensor node that is easier to use and can be applied on an even larger scale due to its reduced cost. A multi-center trial with a larger number of patients is required to confirm the results of this pilot study.\"],\n",
       "  'Current research in evolutionary robotics is largely focused on creating controllers by either evolving neural networks or refning genetic programs based on grammar trees. We propose the use of the dataow languages for the construction of effective robotic controllers and the evolution of new controllers using genetic programming techniques. These languages have the advantages of being built on concurrent execution frameworks that lend themselves to formal verification along with being visualized as a dataow graph. In this paper, we compare and contrast the development and subsequent evolution of one such process-oriented control algorithm. Our control software was built from compos-able, communicating processes executing in parallel, and we tested our solution in an annual fire-fighting robotics competition. Subsequently, we evolved new controllers in a virtual simulation of this parallel dataow domain, and in doing so discovered and quantified more efficient solutions. This research demonstrates the effectiveness of using process networks as the basis for evolutionary robotics.',\n",
       "  'Government supported nano-satellite launch programs and emerging commercial small satellite launch services are reducing the cost of access to space for educational and other CubeSat projects. The cost and complexity of designing and building these satellites remains a vexing complication for many would be CubeSat aspirants. The Open Prototype for Educational NanoSats (OPEN), a proposed nano-satellite development platform, is described in this paper. OPEN endeavors to reduce the costs and risks associated with educational, government and commercial nano-satellite development. OPEN provides free and publicly available plans for building, testing and operating a versatile, low-cost satellite, based on the standardized CubeSat form-factor. OPEN consists of public-domain educational reference plans, complete with engineering schematics, CAD files, construction and test instructions as well as ancillary reference materials relevant to satellite building and operation. By making the plan, to produce a small but capable spacecraft freely available, OPEN seeks to lower the barriers to access on the other side (non-launch costs) of the satellite cost equation.',\n",

The WILGA conferences take place two times a year and the participants are young scientists from this country and abroad. This paper debates chosen topical tracks and some papers presented during the 31 WILGA Multi-Conference, which took place on 8-10 February 2013 at the Faculty of WEiTI PW. The January conference was attended by around 100 persons. Here we discuss closer the subjects of biomedical photonics, electronics and informatics, as well as chosen aspects of applications of advanced photonic, electronic circuits and systems. The 32nd WILGA Symposium took place on 27 May - 02 June 2013 in WUT WILGA resort near Warsaw. These two editions of WILGA Conferences - January and May have generated more than 250 articles, from which around 100 were chosen by the Symposium and Conference Committees to be published in this volume of Proc. SPIE. WILGA Symposium papers are traditionally submitted via the WILGA web page [wilga.ise.pw.edu.pl] to the SPIE Proceedings publishing system [spie.org]. Email for the correspondence is: photonics@ise.pw.edu.pl. All Wilga papers are published in journals Elektronika, IJET-PAN and in Proc. SPIE. Topical tracks of the symposium usually embrace, among others, new technologies for photonics, sensory and nonlinear optical fibers, object oriented design of hardware, photonic metrology, optoelectronics and photonics applications, photonics-electronics co-design, optoelectronic and electronic systems for astronomy and high energy physics experiments, JET and pi-of-the sky experiments development. The symposium In its two editions a year is a summary of the development of numerable Ph.D. theses carried out in this country and this geographical region in the area of advanced electronic and photonic systems.

       "  \"http://DlYbio.org (Do It Yourself Biology) is an online site and a digital brand subscribed to local groups of amateur biologists worldwide. Despite of making up a rather heterogeneous public, DIYbio groups are organized around a concern to make biology accessible, easy and enjoyable. DlYbio combines an open source ethos, with a DIY will to do things and the joy to mess with biological matter. As biohacking is about de-composing and re-composing things, DIYbio takes on a particular approach to the making of the new and to the making of futures that this paper explores. Inspired by Heidegger's notion of the thing, I suggest that differing from institutionalized forms of biology, DlYbio produces things rather than techno-objects. I go into this point by first situating DIYbio in relation to synthetic biology and other instutionalised forms of biology. To explore how DlYbio takes on a particular approach to the making of the new, I look at a number of things that DlYbio groups have projected, designed and realized. I suggest that DlYbio combines a sort of individual craftiness and self-determination to do things with a praxis in which things are always in the making, waiting for the next realization. DIYbio take on an approach to the making of things and futures that is immediate and mundane. Yet, as an emerging public, DlYbio relies on an ambiguous relation to institutionalized science, and might be turned into a transfer of materialities and temporalities from public domains to science.

       "  'Researchers who develop new home technologies using connected devices (e.g. sensors) often want to conduct large-scale field studies in homes to evaluate their technology, but conducting such studies today is quite challenging, if not impossible. Considerable custom engineering is required to ensure hardware and software prototypes work robustly, and recruiting and managing more than a handful of households can be difficult and cost-prohibitive. To lower the barrier to developing and evaluating new technologies for the home environment, we call for the development of a shared infrastructure, called HomeLab. HomeLab consists of a large number of geographically distributed households, each running a common, flexible framework (e.g., HomeOS [4]) in which experiments are implemented. The use of a common framework enables engineering effort, along with experience and expertise, to be shared among many research groups. Recruitment of households to HomeLab can be organic: as a research group recruits (a few) households to participate in its field study, these households can be invited to join HomeLab and participate in future studies conducted by other groups. As the pool of households participating in HomeLab grows, we hope that researchers will find it easier to recruit a large number of households to participate in field studies.',\n",
       "  'The work presented in this paper is part of a larger initiative to develop a Geo-based Load Forecasting (GLF) methodology for distribution master planning in South Africa. Part of the planning process, is forecasting the peak load for a geographical area with a given load class composition. This forecast is used to plan the capacity and timeline of infrastructure to service that area. In this paper, an overview of the GLF peak load estimation technique is provided as background. A Monte Carlo simulation based approach to evaluate the accuracy of this method was developed and is presented. Using the simulation, an evaluation of the current method and load library was completed and the results show that the current method significantly under-estimates the peak load. This can be attributed to changes in the load profile shapes of customers since 2007 when the current load profile library was derived, as well as simplifications in the derivation of the customer load behaviour. Specifically, the differences between the load behaviours of customers within a specific load class is ignored. An enhancement to the geo-based method is presented and compares well with simulated results across different customer classes and load aggregation periods. This improvement reflects the customer load behaviour more accurately and can readily be incorporated as part of the distribution master planning process.',\n",

       "  'A new method for conducting laboratory measurements of the velocities and polarizations of compressional and shear waves in rock samples uses a laser Doppler interferometer (LDI). LDI can measure the particle velocity of a small (0.03 mm(2)) element of the surface of the sample along the direction of the laser beam. By measuring the particle velocity of the same surface element in three linearly independent directions and then transforming those velocities to Cartesian coordinates, three orthogonal components of the particle-velocity vector are obtained. Thus, LDI can be used as a localized three-component (3C) receiver of ultrasonic waves, and, together with a piezoelectric transducer as a source, it can simulate a 3C seismic experiment in the laboratory. Performing such 3C measurements at various locations on the surface of the sample produces a 3C seismogram, which can be used to separate the P-wave and two S-waves and to find the polarizations and traveltimes of those waves. Then, the elasticity tensor of the medium can be obtained by minimizing the misfit between measured and predicted polarizations and traveltimes. Computation of the polarizations and traveltimes of body waves inside a sample with a given elasticity tensor is based on the Christoffel equation. The predicted polarizations on the surface then are obtained using the anisotropic Zoeppritz equations. The type of velocity measured (phase or group velocity) depends on the acquisition geometry and the material properties. This is taken into account in the inversion procedure. A \"walkaway\" laboratory experiment demonstrates the high accuracy of this method.',\n",

The multidisciplinary nature of such systems makes it challenging to give students exposure to and experience in all their facets. This paper proposes a generic architecture, containing multiple processors, that allows easy integration of custom and/or predefined peripherals. The architecture allows students to explore both the hardware and software issues associated with real-time and embedded systems. Furthermore, the architecture can be extended to train students in advanced concepts in embedded multiprocessor systems. This generic architecture has been used for two courses at the National University of Singapore-one on real-time embedded systems and the other emphasizing the hardware aspects of embedded systems. The project in the real-time embedded systems course has students develop a five-a-side soccer system on multiple field-programmable gate array (FPGA) boards using embedded processors. In the embedded hardware design course project, students use an embedded processor-based system to perform decryption of a block encrypted image, accelerated through a custom co-processor. The use of displays gives students a visual/interactive experience and a sense of accomplishment, while reinforcing the theoretical concepts. Both qualitative and quantitative assessment results are presented, showing how students perceived these projects and met the learning objectives.',\n",

This paper employs a simple Markov model to describe burst error behaviors in a CAN network, and the model is used to develop an algorithm for calculating TDMA slot sizes which aim to provide prespecified statistical guarantees of message delivery. Computational results are presented which indicate that the technique can reduce the amount of bandwidth needed for specified reliability levels by a significant factor when compared to the use of message duplicates.

However, the large volume of acoustic data and the lengthy and laborious task of manually analyzing these data have hindered broad application of this technique. To overcome these limitations, a generalized automated detection and classification system (DCS) was developed to efficiently and accurately identify low-frequency baleen whale calls. The DCS (1) accounts for persistent narrowband and transient broadband noise, (2) characterizes temporal variation of dominant call frequencies via pitch-tracking, and (3) classifies calls based on attributes of the resulting pitch tracks using quadratic discriminant function analysis (QDFA). Automated detections of sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis) downsweep calls and North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) upcalls were evaluated using recordings collected in the southwestern Gulf of Maine during the spring seasons of 2006 and 2007. The accuracy of the DCS was similar to that of a human analyst: variability in differences between the DCS and an analyst was similar to that between independent analysts, and temporal variability in call rates was similar among the DCS and several analysts.

Usually, web technologies have been introduced to complement the control systems with smart add-ons and user friendly services or, for instance, to safely allow access to the control system to users from remote sites. Despite this still narrow spectrum of employment, some software technologies developed for high-performance web services, although originally intended and optimized for these particular applications, deserve some features suggesting a deeper integration in a control system and, eventually, their use to develop some of the control system's core components.

Despite the advances in smart sensor technologies, on-board computing capability of smart sensors has been considered as one of the most difficult challenges in the application of the smart sensors in SHM. Taking the advantage of recent developments in microprocessor which provides powerful on-board computing functionality for smart sensors, this paper presents a new decentralized data processing approach for modal identification using the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) algorithm, which is based on signal decomposition technique. It is shown that this method is suitable for implementation in the intrinsically distributed computing environment found in wireless smart sensor networks (WSSNs). The HHT-based decentralized data processing is, then, programmed and implemented on the Crossbow IRIS mote sensor platform.

The ETHZ haptic paddle was developed for a new pHRI course offered in the undergraduate Mechatronics Focus track of the Mechanical Engineering curriculum at ETH Zurich, Switzerland. Twenty students engaged in this 2-h weekly lecture over the 14 weeks of the Autumn 2011 semester, complemented by a weekly 2-h laboratory session with the ETHZ haptic paddle. In pairs, students worked through three common sets of experiments before embarking on a specialization project that investigated one of several advanced topics such as impedance control with force feedback, admittance control, the effect of velocity estimation on stability, or electromyographic control. For these projects, students received additional hardware, including force sensors, electrooptical encoders or high-performance data acquisition cards. The learning objectives were developed in the context of an accompanying faculty development program at ETH Zurich; a set of interactive sequences and the oral exam were explicitly aligned to these learning objectives. The outcomes of the specialization project presentations and oral exams, and a student evaluation of the course, demonstrated that the ETHZ haptic paddle is a valuable tool that allows students to quite literally grasp abstract principles such as mechanical impedance, passivity, and human factors and helps students create a tangible link between theory and practice in the highly interdisciplinary field of pHRI.',\n",
       "  'Most approaches to recognize human activities rely on pattern recognition techniques that are trained once at design time, and then remain unchanged during usage. This reflects the assumption that the mapping between sensor signal patterns and activity classes is known at design-time. This cannot be guaranteed in mobile and pervasive computing, where unpredictable changes can often occur in open-ended environments. Run-time adaptation can address these issues. We introduce and formalize a data processing architecture extending current approaches that allows for a wide range of realizations of adaptive activity recognition systems. The adaptive activity recognition chain (adARC) includes self-monitoring, adaptation strategies and external feedback as components of the now closed-loop recognition system. We show an adARC capable of unsupervised self-adaptation to run-time changing class distributions. It improves activity recognition accuracy when sensors suffer from on-body displacement. We show an adARC capable of adaptation to changing sensor setups. It allows for scalability by enabling a recognition systems to autonomously exploit newly introduced sensors. We discuss other adaptive recognition systems within the adARC architecture.

       "  \"Although several brain regions show significant specialization, higher functions such as cross-modal information integration, abstract reasoning and conscious awareness are viewed as emerging from interactions across distributed functional networks. Analytical approaches capable of capturing the properties of such networks can therefore enhance our ability to make inferences from functional MRI, electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography data. Graph theory is a branch of mathematics that focuses on the formal modelling of networks and offers a wide range of theoretical tools to quantify specific features of network architecture (topology) that can provide information complementing the anatomical localization of areas responding to given stimuli or tasks (topography). Explicit modelling of the architecture of axonal connections and interactions among areas can furthermore reveal peculiar topological properties that are conserved across diverse biological networks, and highly sensitive to disease states. The field is evolving rapidly, partly fuelled by computational developments that enable the study of connectivity at fine anatomical detail and the simultaneous interactions among multiple regions. Recent publications in this area have shown that graph-based modelling can enhance our ability to draw causal inferences from functional MRI experiments, and support the early detection of disconnection and the modelling of pathology spread in neurodegenerative disease, particularly Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, neurophysiological studies have shown that network topology has a profound link to epileptogenesis and that connectivity indices derived from graph models aid in modelling the onset and spread of seizures. Graph-based analyses may therefore significantly help understand the bases of a range of neurological conditions.

We propose a differential on-line heuristic to solve the optimization problem when the traffic load changes. The heuristic avoids the complete MSSR reconfiguration of the optimal off-line solution that may lead to forwarding delay increase or service interruption. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed on-line algorithm, that gracefully modifies the internal MSSR configuration, preserves the load proportional power demand characteristics of the optimal off-line solution.',\n",

       "  \"In this paper, we present the design of a new structural extension for the e-puck mobile robot. The extension may be used to transform what is traditionally a swarm robotics platform into a self-reconfigurable modular robotic system. We introduce a modified version of a previously developed collective locomotion algorithm and present new experimental results across three different themes. We begin by investigating how the performance of the collective locomotion algorithm is affected by the size and shape of the robotic structures involved, examining structures containing up to nine modules. Without alteration to the underlying algorithm, we then analyse the implicit self-assembling and self-reconfiguring capabilities of the system and show that the novel use of 'virtual sensors' can significantly improve performance. Finally, by examining a form of environment driven self-reconfiguration, we observe the behaviour of the system in a more complex environment. We conclude that the modular e-puck extension represents a viable platform for investigating collective locomotion, self-assembly and self-reconfiguration.\",\n",
       "  'To simulate the cardiac niche, a bioreactor system was designed and constructed to incorporate cyclic stretch, rhythmic electrical stimulation, and constant perfusion. The homogeneity of surface strain distribution across the cell culture substrate was confirmed with ARAMIS deformation analysis. The proliferation marker, Ki-67, detected in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and 3-[4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide cytotoxicity assay performed on human atrial fibroblasts confirmed biocompatibility of this novel device. Cyclic stretch treatment for 24 h resulted in the perpendicular alignment of human atrial fibroblasts. An electrical stimulation system containing carbon electrodes was characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and charge injection/recovery studies, which indicated that increased corrosive reactions were associated with a higher input voltage and prolonged pulse duration. Field stimulation delivered through this system could induce rhythmic contractions in adult rat ventricular myocytes, with contractile characteristics similar to those paced in a standard field stimulation chamber. In conclusion, this bioreactor provides a novel tool to study the interaction between physical stimulation and cardiac cell physiology.',\n",

The concept collective action framing' is borrowed from social movement theory to describe how hackers have appropriated notions of a post-industrial, information society in their struggles against intellectual property laws and state censorship. Hackers have reintroduced an element of conflict and antagonism into otherwise politically innocuous visions of post-industrialism. This residual of antagonism can be traced back to the roots of the post-industrial myth in Marxist, historical materialist theory. By exploring these origins, the article proceeds to compare the hopes invested by hackers in the emancipatory force of information technology with the earlier beliefs of labour movements that the forces of history were on their side. Building on this comparison it is argued that technological determinism does not always lead to political resignation, but can also serve as a foundation for collective action.\",\n",

UAVs are teleoperated robots used in various situations, including disaster area inspection and movie content creation. This study aimed to integrate humans and machines with different abilities (i.e., flying) to virtually augment human abilities. Precise manipulation of UAVs normally involves simultaneous control of motion parameters and requires the skill of a trained operator. This paper proposes a new method that directly connects the user's body and head motion to that of the UAV. The user's natural movement can be synchronized with UAV motions such as rotation and horizontal and vertical movements.

Spherical image measurements provided by a single onboard camera along with IMU data consist the main information feeding the estimators. The first algorithm consists of a nonlinear observer, designed using Lyapunov synthesis, while the second is based on the Unscented Kalman filtering technique. Differently with respect to existing approaches, the velocity is directly estimated from the onboard image without the need to fully estimate the vehicle 3D pose. The low computational requirement makes the proposed techniques suitable for applications where the execution time is of prominent importance even if no powerful hardware is available, as it is the case with UAV systems.

This approach contrasts the way existing platforms were designed. The use of a switched Ethernet-network, instead of commonly used bus-systems, depicts a paradigm change in this field of robotics. The second part stipulates a strict decomposition of the robot module into various submodules. A powerful main-CPU, running a mu Clinux, represents the central entity of the architecture. It is supported by several peripheral microcontrollers, which perform low-level tasks and data preprocessing only. The submodules are treated as blackboxes, being independant from each other, only loosely coupled by a local SPI-bus. This results in a more robust and manageable system. As the number of submodules is not restricted, the architecture is very flexible. The employment of standards like POSIX and Ethernet severely eases the developmental process and further research.',\n",

       "  'A cognitive mobile robot must be able to autonomously solve the three complex problems of navigating: where it is, where it is going and how it is going to get there. The first is addressed by techniques for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). The next stage of navigating is to plan a path to a goal, which is often achieved by learning techniques due to the scale of search required. Commonly, the localisation and mapping stage is separated from path planning stage, with the function not of interest being considered ideal in order to simplify the problem (similarly, the goal is often predetermined by an external agent, such as a human operator specifying a location to reach). This work integrates the planning with the localisation and mapping in order to investigate the benefits of considering these aspects together (rather than as a separate functions as is often assumed). Firstly, experiments on real-robots show decreased localisation error in this approach (1.8 mm +/- 0.41 mm to 1.2 mm +/- 0.26 mm). Secondly, the number of steps to goal has concurrently been reduced (13.4 steps to 11.8 steps). This work is novel in the integration of evolutionary computation planning techniques with SLAM.

       "  \"For the purpose of autonomous UAV flight control, cameras are ubiquitously exploited as a cheap and effective onboard sensor for obtaining non-metric position or velocity measurements. Since the metric scale cannot be directly recovered from visual input only, several methods have been proposed in the recent literature to overcome this limitation by exploiting independent 'metric' information from additional onboard sensors. The flexibility of most approaches is, however, often limited by the need of constantly tracking over time a certain set of features in the environment, thus potentially suffering from possible occlusions or loss of tracking during flight. In this respect, in this paper we address the problem of estimating the scale of the observed linear velocity in the UAV body frame from direct measurement of the instantaneous (and non-metric) optical flow, and the integration of an onboard Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for providing (metric) acceleration readings. To this end, two different estimation techniques are developed and critically compared: a standard Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and a novel nonlinear observer stemming from the adaptive control literature. Results based on simulated and real data recorded during a quadrotor UAV flight demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.\",\n",

A robot can provide assistance with these tasks by moving its end effector to poses near the care-receiver's body. However, perceiving and maneuvering around the care-receiver's body can be challenging due to a variety of issues, including convoluted geometry, compliant materials, body motion, hidden surfaces, and the object upon which the body is resting (e.g., a wheelchair or bed). Using geometric simulations, we first show that an assistive robot can achieve a much larger percentage of end-effector poses near the care-receiver's body if its arm is allowed to make contact. Second, we present a novel system with a custom controller and whole-arm tactile sensor array that enables a Willow Garage PR2 to regulate contact forces across its entire arm while moving its end effector to a commanded pose.

       "  'Meteor radar data are continuously collected by different radar systems that operate throughout the year. Analyzing this fast growing, large data set requires efficient and reliable detection routines. Currently most meteor echo routines search for underdense meteor trails, often discarding overdense and nonspecular meteor trails. This is because their main purpose is the study of mesospheric winds. But the study of meteor flux requires the unique identification of each type of meteor reflections. In this paper, a multilayer radar detection and classification algorithm is proposed to correctly identify multiple types of meteor trail reflections. The process consists of two steps. The first step is based on the time-frequency waveform detector. In this step, we start by selecting low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values in order to detect all types of radar echoes; however, a high probability offalse alarm is often produced. In the second step, several features from the detected echoes in step one are extracted and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier is constructed to further classify these echoes. The algorithm was tested using data collected from a 50-MHz radar stationed near Salinas, Puerto Rico, on April 5, 1998. A total of 270 detected echoes were labeled as underdense, overdense, nonspecular, other ionospheric echoes, and noise. We used 50% of the labeled echoes as training samples and divided the rest 50% testing samples as 10 subsets for testing. This technique successfully classified about 85% of the testing samples.

Low cost high-frequency dielectric probes were used in the platform and lab tested on three non-saline soils (ECe1: 2.5 < 0.1 mS/cm). Empirical calibration curves were subjected to cross-validation (leave-one-out method), and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) were respectively 0.09 for the overall model, 0.09 for the sandy soil, 0.07 for the clay loam and 0.08 for the sandy loam.

R2P aims at dramatically reduce time and efforts required to build a prototype robot, making it possible to focus the resources on the development of new robotic applications instead of struggling on their implementation. This enables also people with experience in a specific application domain, but with little technical background, to actively participate in the development of new robotic applications.

       "  \"This article discusses the visions and practices of DIY (do-it-yourself) maker culture in China. It analyses how the ideals held by DIY makers, such as openness, peer production, and individual empowerment, are formulated in relation to China's project of building a creative society and economy. To demonstrate, this article draws from long-term ethnographic research, including the setting up of China's first hackerspace, the proliferation of making, and partnerships between makers and manufacturers. China's makers are driven to reinvent what creativity, innovation, industrial production and citizenship mean today, simultaneously exploiting and challenging political rhetoric. By setting up hackerspaces, designing open technologies and starting up businesses, they craft alternative subject positions, for themselves and others. The contribution of this article is threefold. First, it fills a gap in current research by providing an account of a culture of technology production. Second, it proposes the analytical lens of 'making subjectivities' to open up the concept of the netizen, illustrating the importance for Chinese Internet research to consider not only technology use, but also the culture and materials of its production. Third, it demonstrates that maker culture is better understood as a parasitic culture rather than a counter culture, altering the system from within, contributing to our understanding of the relationship between technology use, production, society, activism and the state.\",\n",

The development and commercialization of low cost smart meters will be an important field of manufacturing in the next future. On the other hand, in addition to simple measurement of energy flows for billing purposes, there is a great interest in customers and utilities in characterize the energy in terms of level of quality, but this requires the calculation of various indexes and the performing of even complex analyses. This leads to an increase of the requirements of both analogical and digital devices composing the smart meters. Great advantages from this point of view come from the availability of more and more powerful microcontrollers at low cost. Analogical devices, such as current and voltage transducers, for power quality assessment over a wide frequency range at low cost still remain a critical aspect.

The aim is to control a large number of simple robots in order to solve common complex tasks. Due to the hardware complexities and cost of robot platforms, current research in swarm robotics is mostly performed by simulation software. The simulation of large numbers of these robots in robotic swarm applications is extremely complex and often inaccurate due to the poor modelling of external conditions. In this paper, we present the design of a low-cost, open platform autonomous micro robot (Colias) for robotic swarm applications. Colias employs a circular platform with a diameter of 4 cm. It has a maximum speed of 35 cm/s which enables it to be used in swarm scenarios very quickly over large arenas. Long-range infrared modules with an adjustable output power allow the robot to communicate with its direct neighbours at a range of 0.5 cm to 2 m. Colias has been designed as a complete platform with supporting software development tools for robotics education and research. It has been tested in both individual and swarm scenarios, and the observed results demonstrate its feasibility for use as a micro-sized mobile robot and as a low-cost platform for robot swarm applications.',\n",

       "  \"Open innovation research and practice recognize the important role of external complementors in value creation. At the same time, firms need to retain exclusive control over some essential components to capture value from their product and/or service system. This paper contributes to the literature by analyzing some of the trade-offs between openness to external value creation and closedness for internal value capture. It focuses on selective openness as a key variable and investigates how it affects value creation by external complementors, specifically the members of user innovation communities. Openness, it is hypothesized, matters to community members: The more open a product design is, the higher their sense of involvement in the innovation project, and the larger the effort they devote to it. Unlike prior literature, different forms and loci of openness are distinguished, specifically the transparency, accessibility, and replicability of different components of the product being developed. Hypotheses are tested based on survey data (n=309) from 20 online communities in the consumer electronics and information technology hardware industries. Multilevel regression analysis is used to account for clustering, and thus nonindependent data, at the community level. We find that openness indeed increases community members' involvement in the innovation project and their contributions to it. Interestingly, however, some forms and loci of openness strongly affect community perceptions and behavior, while others have limited or no impact. This finding suggests that, at least in relation to user communities, the trade-off that firms face between external value creation and internal value capture is softer than hitherto understood. Contingency factors that may be able to explain these patterns are advanced. For example, users are expected to value the form of openness that they have the capabilities and incentives to exploit. The findings in this paper extend the literature on selective openness in innovation. They emphasize the need to study the demand for different forms of openness at the subsystem level and align supply-side strategies to it. In managerial practice, a careful assessment of the demand for openness enables firms to successfully use selective openness and to effectively appropriate value from selectively open systems.\",\n",

The performance of UAV-system components such as inertial navigation sensors, propulsion, control processors and algorithms are gradually improving. Simultaneously, lidar technologies are continuously developing in terms of reliability, accuracy, as well as speed of data collection, storage and processing. The lidar development towards miniature systems with high data rates has, together with recent UAV development, a great potential for new three dimensional (3D) mapping capabilities. Compared to lidar mapping from manned full-size aircraft a small unmanned aircraft can be cost efficient over small areas and more flexible for deployment. An advantage with high resolution lidar compared to 3D mapping from passive (multi angle) photogrammetry is the ability to penetrate through vegetation and detect partially obscured targets. Another advantage is the ability to obtain 3D data over the whole survey area, without the limited performance of passive photogrammetry in low contrast areas. The purpose of our work is to demonstrate 3D lidar mapping capability from a small multirotor UAV. We present the first experimental results and the mechanical and electrical integration of the Velodyne HDL-32E lidar on a six-rotor aircraft with a total weight of 7 kg. The rotating lidar is mounted at an angle of 20 degrees from the horizontal plane giving a vertical field-of-view of 10-50 degrees below the horizon in the aircraft forward directions. For absolute positioning of the 3D data, accurate positioning and orientation of the lidar sensor is of high importance. We evaluate the lidar data position accuracy both based on inertial navigation system (INS) data, and on INS data combined with lidar data. The INS sensors consist of accelerometers, gyroscopes, GPS, magnetometers, and a pressure sensor for altimetry. The lidar range resolution and accuracy is documented as well as the capability for target surface reflectivity estimation based on measurements on calibration standards.

       "  'This paper considers the design, construction, and example use of a new type of 3D printer which fabricates three-dimensional objects from soft fibers (wool and wool blend yarn). This printer allows the substantial advantages of additive manufacturing techniques (including rapid turnaround prototyping of physical objects and support for high levels of customization and configuration) to be employed with a new class of material. This material is a form of loose felt formed when fibers from an incoming feed of yarn are entangled with the fibers in layers below it. The resulting objects recreate the geometric forms specified in the solid models which specify them, but are soft and flexible - somewhat reminiscent in character to hand knitted materials. This extends 3D printing from typically hard and precise forms into a new set of forms which embody a different aesthetic of soft and imprecise objects, and provides a new capability for researchers to explore the use of this class of materials in interactive devices.',\n",

       "  'Communication is responsible for the majority of energy consumption in typical wireless sensor networks (WSNs). While transmission energy can be controlled at each node, reception energy is outside the control of the nodes because they usually do not know the arrival time of their packets and they cannot avoid overhearing packets directed to the other nodes in range. Energy-aware MAC protocols apply duty-cycling which keeps the radio module off for most of the time and wakes it up periodically, but they suffer from overhearing which has been addressed so far either by means of preambles or by means of separate wake-up channels. This paper proposes a complementary approach which exploits the hardware frame filtering capabilities provided by state-of-the-art radio transceivers. Extensive experiments performed on VirtualSense motes show that hardware frame filtering saves more than 50% of the energy spent in the reception of non-intended packets.',\n",

This paper presents the design, implementation and evaluation of a PCIe-based rack area network system called Marlin, which is designed to support the communications and resource sharing needs of disaggregated racks. By virtue of being based on PCIe, Marlin presents a memory-based addressing model for both I/O device sharing among multiple hosts and inter-host communications. That is, when a node communicates with other nodes or accesses resources in the same rack, it uses memory read and write operations. In the area of inter-node communications, Marlin offers hardware-based remote direct memory access (HRDMA) as a first-class communications primitive between servers within a rack. In addition, Marlin supports socket-based communications for legacy network applications and cross-machine zero memory copying for applications designed specifically to take full advantage of memory-based communications.

The control-processing PPC controls data-processing PPCs by using data-exchange mechanisms, such as a shared memory or an on-chip network, which are more uniform and simpler than those between a CPC and PPCs. This control method is applied to a virtual-link control-processing task and packet-processing tasks in a network node with a virtualization function.

We present a proof-of-concept system that has enabled a person with severe quadriplegia named Henry Evans to shave himself in his own home using a general purpose mobile manipulator (PR2 from Willow Garage). The robot primarily provides assistance by holding a tool (e.g., an electric shaver) at user-specified locations around the user\\'s head, while he/she moves his/her head against it. If the robot detects forces inappropriate for the task (e.g., shaving), it withdraws the tool. The robot also holds a mirror with its other arm, so that the user can see what he/she is doing. For all aspects of the task, the robot and the human work together.

With the increasing popularity of open-source processes for developing both software and physical systems, there is a need to develop computational models of product evolution in such dynamic product developments scenarios. Existing studies on the evolution of products involve modeling products as networks, taking snapshots of the structure at different time steps, and comparing the structural characteristics. Such approaches are limited because they do not capture the underlying dynamics through which products evolve. In this paper, we take a step toward addressing this gap by presenting a generative network model for product evolution. The generative model is based on different mechanisms though which networks evolve-addition and removal of nodes, addition and removal of links. The model links local network observations to global network structures. It is utilized for modeling and analyzing the evolution of a software product (Drupal) and a physical product (RepRap) developed by open source processes. For the software product, the generated networks are compared with the actual product structures using various network measures including average degree, density, clustering coefficients, average shortest path, propagation cost, clustered cost, and degree distributions. For the physical product, the product evolution is analyzed in terms of the proposed mechanisms. The proposed model has three general applications: longitudinal studies of a product's evolution, cross-sectional studies of evolution of different products, and predictive analyzes.\",\n",

Our system offers a solution for rehabilitation of the hand, wrist originated problems with a smartphone based mobile mixed reality game that will be used in conjunction with traditional rehabilitation programs such as home treatment. The key factor in the success of the home treatment is compliance of patients to the given therapy instructions. However, therapists report that patients do not carry on their home-exercises and activities. The main reason is the lack of motivation and boredom for the given activities. These activities require patients to carry out set of repetitive movements. The lack of motivation in exercises causes discontinuity and increases the recovery time and eventually increases the cost of the treatment. Therefore, we propose a complete framework by reducing the drawbacks of the traditional therapy. Our framework has three components; hardware, smartphone game, and cloud for data storage and processing.

       "  'The Italian Aerospace Research Center (CIRA) is currently designing an unmanned aerial research system that is lightweight and has high-structural flexibility, code named the High Altitude Performance Demonstrator (HAPD).The project is framed within the Italian Aerospace Research Program, under the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Chapter. This unmanned aerial system is mainly aimed at developing and validating advanced modeling methodologies for flexible aircrafts. A compendium of the system is provided in this paper, together with a deeper discussion of how CIRA developed the structural and aeroelastic design of HAPD. Some experimental tests performed to validate the main concepts are also presented. The vehicle has an unconventional joined-wing configuration that mitigates undesired extreme flexibility, but that results in a more complicated design. First, aeroelasticity has been taken into account from the preliminary stages of design because flexibility significantly affects aircraft behavior. Second, the HAPD structure is redundant with regard to constraints (because of its joined wing), thus making the internal forces dependent on the stiffness distribution. For these reasons, the availability of an integrated methodology that can support the structural design is mandatory. The output of such a methodology consists of primary structure stiffness distributions (fuselage, wings, and vertical tail), compatibly with the absence of any aeroelastic instability, and structural failure under operative loads.',\n",
       "  'In order to construct a green-light-regulated gene expression system for cyanobacteria, we characterized a green-light sensing system derived from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, consisting of the green-light sensing histidine kinase CcaS, the cognate response regulator CcaR, and the promoter of cpcG2 (P-cpcG2). CcaS and CcaR act as a genetic controller and activate gene expression from P-cpcG2 with green-light illumination. The green-light induction level of the native P-cpcG2 was investigated using GFPuv as a reporter gene inserted in a broad-host-range vector. A clear induction of protein expression from native P-cpcG2 under green-light illumination was observed; however, the expression level was very low compared with P-trc, which was reported to act as a constitutive promoter in cyanobacteria. Therefore, a Shine-Dalgarno-like sequence derived from the cpcB gene was inserted in the 5 untranslated region of the cpcG2 gene, and the expression level of CcaR was increased. Thus, constructed engineered green-light sensing system resulted in about 40-fold higher protein expression than with the wild-type promoter with a high ON/OFF ratio under green-light illumination. The engineered green-light gene expression system would be a useful genetic tool for controlling gene expression in the emergent cyanobacterial bioprocesses.',\n",

The vital basis of compensating frequency errors is how to obtain accurately corresponding sensitive parameters of crystal oscillator. In the traditional calibration approach of acceleration sensitivity coefficient, indispensably using precise frequency reference and measurement equipment makes the calibration process expensive and complex, that fails to be widely applied in GPS navigation system. Combined a precise frequency reference of GPS satellites with the carrier tracking loop principle, the paper analyzes the acceleration frequency errors transmission mechanism of crystal oscillator in the carrier tracking loop, and designs an adaptive weighted EKF to handle frequency bias observed values synchronously in multiple tracking loops, which reduces frequency bias estimating noise and separates frequency offset and frequency drift rate, from the receiver's frequency bias observation in the crystal oscillator. And on this basis, acceleration sensitivity coefficients of crystal oscillator calibrate on the super tight combination navigation board by 2g flipping calibration method. The experiments show that the method is able to effectively calibrate acceleration sensitivity coefficients of crystal oscillator, which is the solution base of compensating crystal oscillator acceleration frequency errors on related GPS technology research.\",\n",

The MSSR architecture overcomes scalability and performance issues of single software router by providing parallel forwarding paths. Like many networking devices, a MSSR must be sized for peak traffic load, which implies energy inefficiency at low loads. Thus, we focus on energy saving schemes to improve the router energy efficiency by dynamically adapting the MSSR architecture to the currently offered load. We first introduce an optimal energy saving algorithm defined as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) optimization model. Then, heuristic solutions, named differential algorithms are discussed. While the optimal approach provides higher energy savings, the heuristics avoid the complete MSSR reconfiguration, thus reducing forwarding delays and minimizing service interruption. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed heuristic algorithms, that gracefully modifies the internal MSSR configuration, preserve the load proportional energy demand characteristics of the optimal algorithm, with a minimal loss of efficiency, largely compensated by algorithm simplicity.

       "  \"Understanding the complex properties of electronic and spintronic devices at the micro-and nanoscale is a topic of intense current interest as it becomes increasingly important for scientific progress and technological applications. In operando characterization of such devices by scanning probe techniques is particularly well-suited for the microscopic study of these properties. We have developed a scanning probe microscope (SPM) which is capable of both standard force imaging (atomic, magnetic, electrostatic) and simultaneous electrical transport measurements. We utilize flexible and inexpensive FPGA (field-programmable gate array) hardware and a custom software framework developed in National Instrument's LabVIEW environment to perform the various aspects of microscope operation and device measurement. The FPGA-based approach enables sensitive, real-time cantilever frequency-shift detection. Using this system, we demonstrate electrostatic force microscopy of an electrically biased graphene field-effect transistor device. The combination of SPM and electrical transport also enables imaging of the transport response to a localized perturbation provided by the scanned cantilever tip. Facilitated by the broad presence of LabVIEW in the experimental sciences and the openness of our software solution, our system permits a wide variety of combined scanning and transport measurements by providing standardized interfaces and flexible access to all aspects of a measurement (input and output signals, and processed data). Our system also enables precise control of timing (synchronization of scanning and transport operations) and implementation of sophisticated feedback protocols, and thus should be broadly interesting and useful to practitioners in the field.

       "  \"This paper explores the use of optical mouse sensors for building positioning systems. A low-cost, customized optical sensor positioning system has been developed, with desirable high performance. Unlike the traditional dead-reckoning method using rotary encoders, optical mouse sensors are unacted on the errors induced by wheel slippage. However, some research has indicated that height variations can bring errors in 2D displacement measurements when using optical mouse sensors. What's more, the so-called error cumulative phenomenon is an inevitable problem to every motion positioning system. To overcome these weaknesses, our main contributions are in two aspects. One is that a new adaptation mechanism is presented to enhance the positioning robustness to surface height variations. This performance enhancement attributes to the height-variation awareness of our presented system, in addition to the required positioning capability. The other is that a novel calibration paradigm with the assisted landmarks is proposed to eliminate the error cumulative phenomenon. This induced performance enhancement benefits from the high-speed optic flow sensing capability of optical mouse sensors. Experimental results are reported to validate the enhancement capability of the presented positioning system.\",\n",

In this study, we have investigated whether monophasic and biphasic pulsed ES could exert any effect on the proliferation and differentiation of human cardiac progenitor cells (hCPCs) isolated from human heart fragments. Cells were cultured under continuous exposure to monophasic or biphasic ES with fixed cycles for 1 or 3 days. Results indicate that neither stimulation protocol affected cell viability, while the cell shape became more elongated and reoriented more perpendicular to the electric field direction. Moreover, the biphasic ES clearly induced the upregulation of early cardiac transcription factors, MEF2D, GATA-4, and Nkx2.5, as well as the de novo expression of the late cardiac sarcomeric proteins, troponin T, cardiac alpha actinin, and SERCA 2a. Both treatments increased the expression of connexin 43 and its relocation to the cell membrane, but biphasic ES was faster and more effective. Finally, when hCPCs were exposed to both monophasic and biphasic ES, they expressed de novo the mRNA of the voltage-dependent calcium channel Cav 3.1((1G)) subunit, which is peculiar of the developing heart. Taken together, these results show that ES alone is able to set the conditions for early differentiation of adult hCPCs toward a cardiac phenotype.',\n",
       "  \"In this paper, we present a distributed control strategy, enabling agents to converge onto and travel along a consensually selected curve among a class of closed planar curves. Individual agents identify the number of neighbors within a finite circular sensing range and obtain information from their neighbors through local communication. The information is then processed to update the control parameters and force the swarm to converge onto and circulate along the aforementioned planar curve. The proposed mathematical framework is based on stochastic differential equations driven by white Gaussian noise (diffusion processes). Using this framework, there is maximum probability that the swarm dynamics will be driven toward the consensual closed planar curve. In the simplest configuration where a circular consensual curve is obtained, we are able to derive an analytical expression that relates the radius of the circular formation to the agent's interaction range. Such an intimate relation is also illustrated numerically for more general curves. The agent-based control strategy is then translated into a distributed Braitenberg-inspired one. The proposed robotic control strategy is then validated by numerical simulations and by implementation on an actual robotic swarm. It can be used in applications that involve large numbers of locally interacting agents, such as traffic control, deployment of communication networks in hostile environments, or environmental monitoring.\",\n",

By implementing advanced algorithms to treat overlapping point spread functions (PSFs), imaging of densely activated molecules can improve the limited temporal resolution, as has been well demonstrated in two-dimensional imaging. However, three-dimensional (3D) localization of high-density data remains challenging since PSFs are far more similar along the axial dimension than the lateral dimensions. Here, we present a new, high-density 3D imaging system and algorithm. The hybrid system is implemented by combining astigmatic and biplane imaging. The proposed 3D reconstruction algorithm is extended from our state-of-the art 2D high-density localization algorithm. Using mutual coherence analysis of model PSFs, we validated that the hybrid system is more suitable than astigmatic or biplane imaging alone for 3D localization of high-density data. The efficacy of the proposed method was confirmed via simulation and real data of microtubules.

The robot can then switch into an interaction mode when contact occurs. The control loop must also be designed with interaction in mind. To implement these mechanisms, knowledge of environmental interaction forces is required. In principle, they may be measured or estimated. In this paper, we present a novel model-based method for external wrench estimation in flying robots. The estimation is based on proprioceptive sensors and the robot's dynamics model only.

The disturbance compensator has a dual purpose: to reconstruct the actuator fault (which is used by the FD technique) and to design the discrete-time controller to obtain a FTC. That is, the actuator faults are reconstructed and then the control inputs are modified to achieve a FTC with a comparable behavior to the fault-free case.

The use of SDR system in which its components are implemented by means of software is to reduce cost and complexity in the design and implementation. Whilst the signal processing of FMCW radar is carried out using Matlab (R) with triangular linear frequency modulation (LFM) waveform to obtain the target distance and the target relative speed for stationary and moving target, respectively.

Recently low-cost open-source gas metal arc weld (GMAW) RepRap 3D printers have been developed. The entry-level welders used have minimal controls and therefore lack any real-time measurement of welder voltage or current. The preliminary work on process optimization of GMAW 3D printers requires a low-cost sensor and data logger system to measure welder current and voltage.

The sensor system was designed, built, and tested with two entry-level MIG welders. The full bill of materials and open source designs are provided. Voltage and current were measured while making stepwise adjustments to the manual voltage setting on the welder. Three conditions were tested while welding with steel and aluminum wire on steel substrates to assess the role of electrode material, shield gas, and welding velocity. The results showed that the open source sensor circuit performed as designed and could be constructed for <$100 in components representing a significant potential value through lateral scaling and replication in the 3D printing community.',\n",

This last question came up many times with assertions that traditional service providers need to see opportunity for equivalent or greater revenue dollars before they will buy-in. This paper identifies open value propositions for GFSP stakeholders and proposes a framework for creating and structuring that value.

Relatively new, low-cost open-source microcontrollers provide an alternative way to build sensor-based irrigation controllers for both agricultural and domestic applications.

Although there is not a unique definition of what a smart city is, it is generally accepted that \"smart\" urban policies refer to local governments\\' initiatives that use information and communication technologies in order to increase the quality of life of their inhabitants while contributing to a sustainable development. So far, \"smart city\" approaches have generally been related to top-down processes of technology diffusion. The purpose of this paper is to present a broader view on \"smart\" initiatives to analyze both top-down and bottom-up dynamics in a smart city. The authors argue that these two perspectives are complementary and its combination can reinforce the collaboration between different city stakeholders. Top-down and bottom-up initiatives are not opposed forces but, on the contrary, can have a synergistic effect on the innovation capacity of the city.

Even if the authors have emphasized the importance of the bottom-up initiatives, citizens do not have often the resources to act without governmental intervention. This is the case of services that require high-cost infrastructures or regulatory changes. Also, as it usually happens in the case of disruptive technology, it is hard for citizens to understand the possibilities of its use. In these cases, firms and institutions must play an important role in the first phases of the diffusion of innovations, by informing and incentivizing its use. It is also important to note that some of the emerging usages of technology are confronted to legal or regulatory issues. For instance, distributed and shared Wi-Fi networks might be in opposition to economic interests of internet providers, that often difficult its expansion. It is also the case of services of the sharing economy that represent a menace to established institutions (like the tensions between Uber and taxi companies, or Airbnb and hotels). In these cases, city halls like it is the case in Barcelona, tend to respond to these emergent uses of technology by regulating to ensure protection to existing corporate services.',\n",

In this paper we evaluate the accuracy of a system consisting of a lidar sensor on a small UAV. High geometric accuracy in the produced point cloud is a fundamental qualification for detection and recognition of objects in a single-flight dataset as well as for change detection using two or several data collections over the same scene. Our work presented here has two purposes: first to relate the point cloud accuracy to data processing parameters and second, to examine the influence on accuracy from the UAV platform parameters. In our work, the accuracy is numerically quantified as local surface smoothness on planar surfaces, and as distance and relative height accuracy using data from a terrestrial laser scanner as reference. The UAV lidar system used is the Velodyne HDL-32E lidar on a multirotor UAV with a total weight of 7 kg. For processing of data into a geographically referenced point cloud, positioning and orientation of the lidar sensor is based on inertial navigation system (INS) data combined with lidar data. The combination of INS and lidar data is achieved in a dynamic calibration process that minimizes the navigation errors in six degrees of freedom, namely the errors of the absolute position (x, y, z) and the orientation (pitch, roll, yaw) measured by GPS/INS.

The UAV brings mobility to the integrated sensor payload so that the sensors can access remote sites and collect data of structures and field features following an earthquake or a natural disaster. A light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor and high resolution camera are installed on a UAV to obtain highly detailed and accurate topological maps of physical surfaces from which structural cracks, surface chances and minor faulting can be detected. One of the challenges in automating the operation of the UAV in challenging operational environments such as GPS-denied environments (e. g., under bridges, indoor environments) is accurate navigation. In a GPS-denied environment, localization relies on on-board sensors, which has limited accuracy when positioning the UAV in a fixed coordinate system. This paper explores solutions to this problem with vision-and marker-based localization methods. The experimental results are based on a LiDAR and camera payload integrated with an octo-rotor UAV platform that has an onboard inertial measurement unit. The experimental results show that three dimensional navigation and geometric mapping in unknown operational environments are both feasible and accurate.',\n",

Advances such as open source hardware, personal medical devices, and mobile phone apps are creating opportunities for custom-made medical devices and personalized care. However, they also introduce new challenges in balancing the need for regulation (ensuring safety and performance) with the need to innovate flexibly and efficiently. Compared with the emergence of new technologies, health technology design standards and regulations evolve slowly, and therefore, it can be difficult to apply these standards to the latest developments.

Medical device standards may not be flexible enough when evaluating the usability of mobile medical devices that can be used in a multitude of different ways, outside of clinical settings.

However, a number of challenges exist: ultra-high-bit-rate requirements from the transport of increased bandwidth radio streams for multiple antennas in future mobile networks, and low latency and jitter to meet delay requirements and the demands of joint processing. A new fronthaul functional division is proposed which can alleviate the most demanding bit-rate requirements by transport of baseband signals instead of sampled radio waveforms, and enable statistical multiplexing gains.

       "  \"Datacenter networks deal with a variety of workloads, ranging from latency-sensitive small flows to bandwidth-hungry large flows. Load balancing schemes based on flow hashing, e.g., ECMP, cause congestion when hash collisions occur and can perform poorly in asymmetric topologies. Recent proposals to load balance the network require centralized traffic engineering, multipath-aware transport, or expensive specialized hardware. We propose a mechanism that avoids these limitations by (i) pushing load-balancing functionality into the soft network edge (e.g., virtual switches) such that no changes are required in the transport layer, customer VMs, or networking hardware, and (ii) load balancing on fine-grained, near-uniform units of data (flowcells) that fit within end-host segment offload optimizations used to support fast networking speeds. We design and implement such a soft-edge load balancing scheme, called Presto, and evaluate it on a 10 Gbps physical testbed. We demonstrate the computational impact of packet reordering on receivers and propose a mechanism to handle reordering in the TCP receive offload functionality. Presto's performance closely tracks that of a single, non-blocking switch over many workloads and is adaptive to failures and topology asymmetry.\",\n",

However, this type of fixation is associated with some potential complications that can be obviated if percutaneous fixation is avoided. The purpose of the present study was to prospectively collect clinical and radiographic outcomes of operative correction of hammertoe deformity using a permanently implanted 1-piece intramedullary device. A total of 29 patients with 60 painful, rigid hammertoes were prospectively enrolled, clinically and radiographically examined, operatively treated, then followed and re-examined. The outcomes were measured in terms of the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society lesser toe and visual analog pain scores. After >= 18 months of follow-up, the incidence of fusion with satisfactory radiographic alignment was 85% (51 of 60 toes). One toe (1.67%) developed early postoperative implant failure because of dislocation of the device, there were no cases of infection, and the mean American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society lesser toe score was 87.4 +/- 1.3 and the mean visual analog scale pain score was 1.78 +/- 0.94. Twenty-five patients (86.21%) stated that they had no symptoms in the involved toes after surgery, and 4 (13.8%) experienced occasional pain, 2 (6.9%) of whom reported limitations of recreational activities and 2 (6.9%) reported persistent swelling without activity limitations.

These data require to be self-reported by the users and this activity can be very cumbersome, requiring an high compliance to be effective: instead users often fail in reporting their data due to forgetfulness, lack of time and motivation. To overcome these problems, we propose to exploit Tangible User Interface for relieving the task of self-reporting.

       "  'Pelvic fractures are uncommon but complex injuries associated with a high degree of morbidity and mortality. Most fractures involving the pelvis, specifically the sacrum, can be effectively stabilized with iliosacral screws alone. However, significantly unstable fractures, particularly vertical shear patterns, as well as U-type variant sacral fracture patterns that create spinopelvic instability, require the addition of lumbopelvic fixation. The surgical technique involves neurologic decompression as necessary, multiplanar reduction of the pelvic ring and sacrum, and placement of stable fixation. Treatment of these severe injuries requiring lumbopelvic fixation is challenging and requires active collaboration between spine trauma and pelvis trauma surgeons. Although not routinely used, lumbopelvic fixation is an essential technique for the stabilization of complex pelvis fractures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.',\n",

This paper examines how the activity of making functioned for elderly DIY enthusiasts as way of remaking and reliving the past and as a means for expressing class belonging and citizenship. We show that making and hacking is not practiced in a void independent of social, political or economic forces.

       "  'Over the last few years, depth cameras have become increasingly popular for a range of applications, including human-computer interaction and gaming, augmented reality, machine vision, and medical imaging. Many of the commercially-available devices use the time-of-flight principle, where active illumination is temporally coded and analyzed in the camera to estimate a per-pixel depth map of the scene. In this paper, we propose a fundamentally new imaging modality for all time-of-flight (ToF) cameras: per-pixel radial velocity measurement. The proposed technique exploits the Doppler effect of objects in motion, which shifts the temporal illumination frequency before it reaches the camera. Using carefully coded illumination and modulation frequencies of the ToF camera, object velocities directly map to measured pixel intensities. We show that a slight modification of our imaging system allows for color, depth, and velocity information to be captured simultaneously. Combining the optical flow computed on the RGB frames with the measured metric radial velocity allows us to further estimate the full 3D metric velocity field of the scene. The proposed technique has applications in many computer graphics and vision problems, for example motion tracking, segmentation, recognition, and motion deblurring.',\n",
       "  'A wireless sensor node platform was created along with a base station that can be used to monitor various parameters in the industry. A literature survey was conducted on important parameters found in the industry. The various standards that are set out for these parameters were analysed. The developed wireless sensor node platform along with the base station shows that a wide variety of industrial parameters can be monitored at once from one central place. The simplistic deployment/instalment of the created wireless sensor node platform along with the centralisation of important industrial parameters should appeal to large industries and reduce the risk of accidental unfortunate events.',\n",
       "  'This essay reviews diverse strands of empirical and theoretical work in different urban studies areas (urban planning, urban ethnography, urban geography, and STS) reflecting on the manifold ways in which the smart city project is being \"opened up\" for scrutiny through experimental projects developing digitally-mediated sensing practices of either a specific or broad kind: i.e., producing both devices formally devised for sensing specific parameters, and sensing devices - emerging from less specific digital technology arrangements-used to share experiences, show solutions or politicize different urban issues. In doing this, we seek to understand, from an STS standpoint, the different ways in which a broad range of works are analysing the development, intervention, maintenance, and opposition of these ideas. In the first section we focus on understanding the definitions, features and clashes that several of these corporate projects (mostly municipal in nature) have come across, deploying smart devices, such as sensors to produce an \"algorithmic city\". In the second section we expand the meanings of \"smartness,\" focusing on grassroots appropriations of broader digital arrangements and politicizations of open source infrastructures to display other forms of urban sensitivities, contributing to the cosmopoliticization of the \"smart city\" project.',\n",
       "  'In this work, an innovative idea of capturing human handwriting in real time using inertial sensors is introduced. The paper presents a novel way of using an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to create a \"Smart pen\". This Smart Pen can detect changes in its orientation that occur during writing any word, or an alphabet. The onboard gyroscopes and accelerometers of the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) calculate the values of yaw, pitch and roll angles made by the 3 dimensional geometry of the pen. These values are sent to a micro controller board using the Inter Integrated Circuit (I2C) protocol for serial communication. Depending on these values and the writing style of each letter, the Pen identifies which alphabet is written. The writing style of each person is different. Hence calibration for each person is necessary. This recognized alphabet/word can be displayed on a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) screen which is interfaced to an Arduino board.',\n",

The control law is termed dynamic as it based on the dynamics and kinematics of the vehicle. The proposed design relies on the notion of a virtual camera and image moments as visual features to simplify the kinematics and dynamics.

       "  '5-6 MHz PMNT/epoxy 1-3 composites were prepared by a modified dice-and-fill method. They exhibit excellent properties for ultrasonic transducer applications, such as ultrahigh thickness electromechanical coupling coefficient k(t) (85.7%), large piezoelectric coefficient d(33) (1209 pC/N), and relatively low acoustic impedance Z (1.82 x 10(7) kg/(m(2)s)). Besides, two types of Time-of-Flight Diffraction (TOFD) ultrasonic transducers have been designed, fabricated, and characterized, which have different matching layer schemes with the acoustic impedance of 4.8 and 5.7 x 10(6) kg/(m(2)s), respectively. In the detection on a backwall of 12.7 mm polystyrene, the former exhibits higher detectivity, the relative pulse-echo sensitivity and -6 dB relative bandwidth are -21.93 dB and 102.7%, respectively, while the later exhibits broader bandwidth, the relative pulse-echo sensitivity and -6 dB relative bandwidth are -24.08 dB and 117.3%, respectively. These TOFD ultrasonic transducers based on PMNT/epoxy 1-3 composite exhibit considerably improved performance over the commercial PZT/epoxy 1-3 composite TOFD ultrasonic transducer.',\n",

The pupils were guided along a multidisciplinary path in which traditional and innovative teaching methods were composed for educating while engaging the children. It led to the creation of 6 automated puppet plays focused on the themes of environmental awareness as a result. In this process, storytelling and visual programming acted as powerful means for merging different educational concepts and techniques. The data collected through the direct observation and the questionnaires indicate that the experience was perceived as positive and interesting.

However, the development and testing process of these control systems has been confined to a few specific cases, the details of which have not been thoroughly reported in available literature. This paper details the development, construction and implementation of a real-time, Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test set-up for such a control system. A general purpose, phasor-based control algorithm is deployed on a Compact Reconfigurable Input/Output (cRIO) controller from National Instruments. The complete, closed-loop experimental set-up, the hardware used and the rationale behind different design choices are also documented. As this test-set-up uses IEEE C37.118 data over a TCP/IP network, the complete, real-time data path is examined. A real-time HIL test with the implemented controller is also presented and results are analysed.',\n",

We introduce a reconfigurable OTA chamber whose walls are lined with antennas, a few of which may be attached to a channel emulator and the balance of which are connected to reconfigurable impedances. Initial simulations and measurements with this topology demonstrate that through control of the impedances and the port excitations, the chamber offers significant control over the achieved fading distribution, spatial correlation, and power angular spectrum at the device under test.',\n",

Particularly in medium-sized and large areas they require a lot of time and intensive labour which directly translates into an increase in the measurement cost. Introduction of an automated system would increase efficiency of the measurements, and therefore could present both practical and scientific benefit. The paper presents initial feasibility study for designing a system that permits the measurement of selected acoustic parameters for any choice of three-dimensional grid of measurement points throughout the volume of the room. The system will utilize an autonomous probe attached to a blimp, and will be able to measure and analyze acoustic characteristics of the rooms. The article discusses the initial choices of the system elements, starting from the general idea, through the mechanical design and control procedures, the software that controls positioning and flying of the probe, up to the automation of the measurement procedure and its possible impact on the acoustic field.',\n",
       "  'Massively parallel architectures are proposed as a promising solution to speed up data-intensive applications and provide the required computational power. In particular, Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) many-core architectures have been adopted for multimedia and signal processing applications with massive amounts of data parallelism where both performance and flexible programmability are important metrics. However, this class of processors has faced many challenges due to its increasing fabrication cost and design complexity. Moreover, the increasing gap between design productivity and chip complexity requires new design methods. Nowadays, the recent evolution of silicon integration technology, on the one hand, and the wide usage of reusable Intellectual Property (IP) cores and FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays), on the other hand, are attractive solutions to meet these challenges and reduce the time-to-market. The objective of this work is to study the performances of massively parallel SIMD on-chip architectures with current design methodologies based on recent integration technologies. Flexibility offered by these new design tools allows design space exploration to search for the most effective implementations. This work introduces an IP-based design methodology for easy building configurable and flexible massively parallel SIMD processing on FPGA platforms. The proposed approach allows implementing a generic parallel architecture based on IP assembly that can be tailored in order to better satisfy the requirements of highly-demanding applications. The experimental results show effectiveness of the design methodology as well as the performances of the implemented SoC. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.',\n",
       "  'Over the past few years we have observed a phenomenal growth of smartphones. Smartphones are equipped with various hardware and software resources such as Bluetooth, camera and gravity sensors. If these resources are not managed appropriately, it may cause severe problems such as battery drains and system crashes. However, the specifications of resource management are usually implicit. In this paper, we investigate the problem of mining resource management specifications from off-the-shelf apps. Our key insight is that if a set of operations to a resource are frequently performed in a specific order, it must contain the specifications of how to manage the resource. We design a tool named Automatic Resource Specification Miner (ARSM), to automatically extract resource management specifications in smartphones. In our experiments, ARSM can mine tens of rules from 100 top rated Android apps within six hours. Our work is orthogonal to existing studies on diagnosing smartphone apps. With the resource management specifications discovered, ARSM can help them pinpoint more bugs in apps.',\n",
       "  'Photothermal therapy is an effective means to induce tumor cell death, since tumor tissue is more sensitive to temperature increases than normal tissue. Biological responses depend on tissue temperature; target tissue temperature needs to be precisely measured and controlled to achieve desired thermal effects. In this work, a unique photoacoustic (PA) sensor is proposed for temperature measurement during interstitial laser phototherapy. A continuous-wave laser light and a pulsed laser light, for photothermal irradiation and photoacoustic temperature measurement, respectively, were delivered to the target tissue through a fiber coupler. During laser irradiation, the PA amplitude was measured. The Gruneisen parameter and the bioheat equation were used to determine the temperature in strategic positions in the target tissue. Our results demonstrate that the interstitial PA amplitude is a linear function of temperature in the range of 22 to 55 degrees C, as confirmed by thermocouple measurement. Furthermore, by choosing appropriate laser parameters, the maximum temperature surrounding the active diffuse fiber tip in tissue can be controlled in the range of 41 to 55 degrees C. Thus, this sensor could potentially be used for fast, accurate, and convenient three-dimensional temperature measurement, and for real-time feedback and control of interstitial laser phototherapy in cancer treatment.',\n",
       "  'Side channels remain a challenge to information flow control and security in modern computing platforms. Resource partitioning techniques that minimise the number of shared resources among processes are often used to address this challenge. In this work, we focus on multi core platforms and we demonstrate that even seemingly strong isolation techniques based on dedicated cores can be circumvented through the use of thermal channels. Specifically, we show that the processor core temperature can be used both as a side channel as well as a covert communication channel even when the system implements strong spatial and temporal partitioning. Our experiments on an Intel Xeon server platform demonstrate covert thermal channels that achieve up to 12.5 bps and weak thermal side channels that can detect processes executed on neighbouring cores. This work therefore shows a limitation in the isolation that can be achieved on existing multi-core systems.',\n",

The sensor consists of a 3-axis accelerometer, a 3-axis gyro, and a 3-axis magnetometer. A digital motion processor is also used. To remove gyro drifts in the long run, a sensor fusion method is applied that combines accelerometer, gyro, and magnetometer data. Before this data fusion, bias removal of accelerometer and calibration of magnetometer are carried out. The results of this sensor fusion are given to a virtual camera for real-time graphical rendering of the virtual environment. This program shows updates virtual images of the head-mounted display with 33 frames per second. The results show that the drift of gyro is reduced to less than 1.0 degrees over 3 minutes.',\n",

Recent work shows that ocean acidification will negatively affect calcification processes for many species, including reef-building corals. It is possible that OA may cause diminished fish respiratory stress and impact sensory capabilities. To date most all of these scientific findings are from short-term experiments in laboratory aquaria on limited sets of organisms.

This goal extends to include minimal effect on other environmental experimental conditions while supporting evaluation of the consequences of ocean acidification on marine organisms and communities. The techniques for chemical and physical control of CO2 chemistry are well understood, however they heavily depend on the marine environments of interest. The techniques and application technologies used to execute FOCE required considerable time to develop while building expertise that allows transfer to new environmental situations. MBARI has now put FOCE together in an open source package of technology and expertise in a product called xFOCE. xFOCE shows how FOCE techniques cost-effective and adaptable, reduce the learning curve and make it a useful tool for multi-disciplinary Ocean Acidification (OA) studies in any marine environment. xFOCE includes the idea of community building just as other open technology projects do to enable OA researchers. xFOCE gives baseline references designs on the use of FOCE tools and techniques by collating contributing expertise and technical support form the OA community currently using the xFOCE concept.',\n",

       "  'In this paper, we propose a nonlinear controller that stabilizes unmanned aerial vehicles in GPS-denied environments with respect to visual targets by using only onboard sensing. The translational velocity of the vehicle is estimated online with a nonlinear observer, which exploits spherical visual features as the main source of information. With the proposed solution, only four visual features have shown to be enough for the observer to operate in a real scenario. In addition, the observer is computationally light with constant numerical complexity, involving small-dimension matrices. The observer output is then exploited in a nonlinear controller designed with an integral backstepping approach, thus yielding a novel robust control system. By means of Lyapunov analysis, the stability of the closed-loop system is proved. Extensive simulation and experimental tests with a quadrotor are carried out to verify the validity and robustness of the proposed approach. The control system runs fully onboard on a standard processor, and only a low-cost sensing suite is employed. Tracking of a target whose speed exceeds 2m/s is also considered in the real-hardware experiments.',\n",

This paper explores the fit of Zipf-like distributions typical of network traffic, to updates of user pages and the entity graph, for the new Facebook data center network architecture. We find that network resource consumption could be reduced by as much as 40-50% through several changes, either to the software, or to the data center design. Of these, employing a connected hub-and-spoke subgraph representation for each popular node, with each pod operating locally on its node of the subgraph, appears to hold the most energy savings potential. This work is part of a larger effort to more completely characterize the efficiency of data center computer- and network architectures beyond the normal reporting of facility power utilization efficiency (PUE), which is blind to energy proportionality and other aspects of the efficiency within the computer- and network architecture, or IT portion, of the data center.',\n",

This study proposed a wireless-networked decentralized fuzzy control scheme to regulate the environmental parameters of various culture zones within a greenhouse. The proposed scheme can create different environmental conditions for cultivating different crops in various zones and achieve diversification or standardization of crop production. A star-type wireless sensor network is utilized to communicate with each sensing node, actuator node, and control node in various zones within the greenhouse. The fuzzy rule-based inference system is used to regulate the environmental parameters for temperature and humidity based on real-time data of plant growth response provided by a growth stage selector.
