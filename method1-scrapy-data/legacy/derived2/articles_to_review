However, a number of barriers have stood in the way of the integration of eye tracking into everyday applications, including the intrusiveness, robustness, availability and price of eye-tracking systems. To lower these barriers, we have developed the openEyes system. The system consists of an open-hardware design for a digital eye tracker that can be built from low-cost off-the-shelf components, and a set of open-source software tools for digital image capture, manipulation, and analysis in eye-tracking applications. We expect that the availability of this system will facilitate the development of eye-tracking applications and the eventual integration of eye tracking into the next generation of everyday human computer interfaces. We discuss the methods and technical challenges of low-cost eye tracking as well as the design decisions that produced our current system.","1":"In this paper we describe a localization and local communication system which allows situated agents to communicate locally, obtaining at the same time both the range and the bearing of the emitter without the need of any centralized control or any external reference. The system relies on infrared communications with frequency modulation and is composed of two interconnected modules for data and power measurement. Thanks to the open hardware license under which it is released, the research community can easily replicate the system at a low cost and\/or adapt it for applications in sensor networks and in robotics.","2":"Requirements for modern and future control systems for large projects like International Linear Collider demand high availability for control system components. Recently telecom industry came up with a great open hardware specification - Advanced Telecom Computing Architecture (ATCA). This specification is aimed for better reliability, availability and serviceability. Since its first market appearance in 2004. ATCA platform has shown tremendous growth and proved to be stable and well represented by a number of vendors. ATCA is an industry standard for highly available systems. On the other hand Service Availability Forum, a consortium of leading communications and computing companies, describes interaction between hardware and software. SAF defines a set of specifications such as Hardware Platform Interface, Application Interface Specification. SAF specifications provide extensive description of highly available systems, services and their interfaces. Originally aimed for telecom applications, these specifications can be used for accelerator controls software as well. This study describes benefits of using these specifications and their possible adoption to accelerator control systems. It is demonstrated how EPICS Redundant IOC was extended using Hardware Platform Interface specification, which made it possible to utilize benefits of the ATCA platform. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Risk monitoring using a network of wireless sensors is one of the most promising emerging technologies for mitigation of these hazards. Recently, a smart sensor based on the Berkeley Mote platform was introduced, and an application to the next generation of structural health monitoring and control was proposed. The Mote has on-board microprocessor and ready-made wireless communication capabilities. In this paper.. the performance of the MICA and MICA2 Mote is investigated through shaking table tests employing a two-storey steel structure. The acceleration sensor is tested, and its performance for wireless measurement and specific risk monitoring applications.. such as damage detection in the structure, is presented. The MICA2 Mote is shown to have sufficient performance for the intended purpose.

Even strategies designed with specific social goals in mind rarely succeed unless there is great attention to the details. For instance some observers have claimed that tight intellectual property (IP) protection prevents developing countries from accessing the benefits of emerging technologies and they should, therefore, develop other strategies. In this chapter, Dhanaraj Thakur explores one such strategy-an \"open access\" system of IP in developing countries. He uses open source software to illustrate the range of possible property arrangements. He notes, however, that the application of these principles in nanotechnology has thus far been limited and that earlier studies have shown that open source technologies still require significant complementary facilities and skills that are less likely to be available in developing country contexts. While open. source might be part of a strategy that can help a developing country capitalize on nanotechnology, Thakur argues that it will not be a panacea.-eds.","5":"Progress in analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) has been hindered by obstructions to hardware innovation and by software incompatibility. In this paper, we announce and outline the Open AUC Project. The goals of the Open AUC Project are to stimulate AUC innovation by improving instrumentation, detectors, acquisition and analysis software, and collaborative tools. These improvements are needed for the next generation of AUC-based research. The Open AUC Project combines on-going work from several different groups. A new base instrument is described, one that is designed from the ground up to be an analytical ultracentrifuge. This machine offers an open architecture, hardware standards, and application programming interfaces for detector developers. All software will use the GNU Public License to assure that intellectual property is available in open source format. The Open AUC strategy facilitates collaborations, encourages sharing, and eliminates the chronic impediments that have plagued AUC innovation for the last 20 years. This ultracentrifuge will be equipped with multiple and interchangeable optical tracks so that state-of-the-art electronics and improved detectors will be available for a variety of optical systems. The instrument will be complemented by a new rotor, enhanced data acquisition and analysis software, as well as collaboration software. Described here are the instrument, the modular software components, and a standardized database that will encourage and ease integration of data analysis and interpretation software.","6":"The development of robotic cognition and the advancement of understanding of human cognition form two of the current greatest challenges in robotics and neuroscience, respectively. The RobotCub project aims to develop an embodied robotic child (iCub) with the physical (height 90 cm and mass less than 23 kg) and ultimately cognitive abilities of a 2.5-year-old human child. The iCub will be a freely available open system which can be used by scientists in all cognate disciplines from developmental psychology to epigenetic robotics to enhance understanding of cognitive systems through the study of cognitive development. The iCub will be open both in software, but more importantly in all aspects of the hardware and mechanical design. In this paper the design of the mechanisms and structures forming the basic 'body' of the iCub are described. The papers considers kinematic structures dynamic design criteria, actuator specification and selection, and detailed mechanical and electronic design. The paper concludes with tests of the performance of sample joints, and comparison of these results with the design requirements and simulation projects.","7":"Among the novel flow techniques, multicommutated flow-injection analysis (MCFIA), multi-syringe FIA (MSFIA) and multi-pumping flow systems (MPFSs) should be highlighted. The main disadvantage of these techniques is the availability of hardware and\/or software for systems control. In this article, we present new instrumentation and possible trends for MCFIA, MPFS, MSFIA and the combination of these techniques. We discuss the potential of Autoanalysis software, which does not require the user to have any computer-programming skills to develop analytical methods. Feedback mechanisms in the software allow users to design smart systems that are able to make decisions without human intervention. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Nonetheless, our knowledge of its deployment outside the software industry is very limited. This paper focuses on the open source development of tangible objects, the so-called open design. We propose a generalised definition of open source development. Drawing on 27 exploratory interviews and six comparative case studies selected from a pool of more than 75 projects, we analyse the workings of open design. The analysis reveals that open design is already being implemented in a substantial variety of projects with different organisational and institutional structures.","9":null,"10":["BACKGROUND: Clinical management of orthopedic hardware infections related to ankle fracture fixation may present difficult therapeutic dilemmas. Typically, management includes removal of the hardware, debridement of necrotic tissue, and eventual placement of an alternative method of stabilization, usually, an external fixator or cast. However, problems arise when the fracture cannot be managed adequately with an external method. Such is the case with supination external rotation (SER) fractures, yet maintaining the hardware in the setting of infection typically is not considered an option.","METHODS: Case report and review of pertinent English-language literature.","RESULTS: The patient was a 47-year-old man with diabetes mellitus who sustained a type IV SER fracture that was treated with plate and screw fixation. Six weeks postoperatively, he presented with infection of the lateral ankle incision and the hardware. This was treated with debridement of the wound and dressing changes while leaving the hardware in place. It was decided to use a free muscle flap in an effort to preserve the ankle for a functional outcome versus the alternative of a below-knee amputation. With a free rectus abdominis flap, the lower extremity was preserved, and after four months, the patient was able to walk. One year postoperatively, the patient was ambulating without difficulty, and the hardware was still in place.","CONCLUSIONS: This report examines the dilemma of SER ankle fractures and how management strategies must be tailored to the individual situation. In some cases, the hardware must be considered essential to avoid below-knee amputation."],"11":["The research community worldwide has increasingly drawn its attention to the weaknesses of the current Internet. Many proposals are addressing the perceived problems, ranging from new enhanced protocols to fix specific problems up to the most radical proposal to redesign and deploy a fully new Internet. Most of the problems in the current Internet are rooted in the tremendous pace of increase of its use. As a consequence there was little time to address the deficiencies of the Internet from an architectural point of view.","Within FP7, the European Commission has facilitated the creation of European expert groups around the theme FIRE \"Future Internet Research and Experimentation\". FIRE has two related dimensions: on one hand, promoting experimentally-driven long-term, visionary research on new paradigms and networking concepts and architectures for the future Internet; on the other hand, building a large-scale experimentation facility supporting both medium- and long-term research on networks and services by gradually federating existing and new testbeds for emerging or future Internet technologies. By addressing future challenges for the Internet such as mobility, scalability, security and privacy, this new experimentally-driven approach is challenging the mainstream perceptions for future Internet development. This new initiative is intended to complement the more industrially-driven approaches which are addressed under the FP7 Objective \"The Network of the Future\" within the FP7-ICT Workprogramme 2007-08. FIRE is focused on exploring new and radically better technological solutions for the future Internet, while preserving the \"good\" aspects of the current Internet, in terms of openness, freedom of expression and ubiquitous access. The FIRE activities are being launched in the 2nd ICT call, which closes in October 2007, under the FP7-ICT Objective 1.6 \"New Paradigms and Experimental Facilities\" (budget is an element of 40m).

We highlight how many aspects of open source software appear initially puzzling to an economist. As we have acknowledged, our ability to answer confidently many of the issues raised here questions is likely to increase as the open source movement itself grows and evolves. At the same time, it is heartening to us how much of open source activities can be understood within existing economic frameworks, despite the presence of claims to the contrary. The labor and industrial organization literatures provide lenses through which the structure of open source projects, the role of contributors, and the movement's ongoing evolution can be viewed.","19":"This paper covers the research activities performed at the CNR Institute for Advanced Energy Technologies \"Nicola Giordano\", aimed at developing, assembling and testing a hydrogen generator HYGen II, to integrate with a polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) for stationary applications.

Some functions of CODAC require deterministic, hard real-time communication and synchronization between distributed nodes. These requirements are addressed by the CODAC High Performance Networks. The CODAC network infrastructure is being defined including space allocation for backbone cable termination as well as housing network equipments in different ITER plant buildings, cable trenches, network topology and backbone. The ITER building design is in final stage so the activities in this direction are quite well in advance. Many prototyping and market survey activities leading to technology decisions for High Performance Networks (HPN) have been launched in late 2008. These activities are evaluating different commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) technologies as well as technologies being used in existing fusion and non-fusion experiments. In this paper we provide the current status of activities which are ongoing to define CODAC network infrastructure as well as a report on technology decisions. Finally we provide a plan and roadmap to complete this task of defining CODAC networks and network infrastructure. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

However, commercially available NICs lack programmability. Furthermore, the use of standard NICs implies that each packet crosses the bus twice, and is processed and routed in software by the OS, thus reducing forwarding performance. In this paper, we discuss the design and the implementation of an FPGA-based NIC that permits overcoming the performance bottleneck and the lack of flexibility of commercial NICs. Performance and limitations of the proposed approach are thoroughly discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This new technology has transformed the cytogenetics laboratory by adapting techniques that have heretofore been the province of molecular geneticists. Intimate knowledge and comfortable familiarity with these techniques are now a must for the modern cytogeneticist, rather than a stimulating but discretionary intellectual exercise or an elective luxury. The cytogenetic laboratory of the future will likely have more scanners than microscopes, more software packages than darkrooms, and more technologists, supervisors, and directors with molecular training than ever before. This technical convergence between molecular diagnostics and clinical cytogenetics is exciting and has already resulted in many stimulating discoveries. However, the traditional skills of the cytogeneticist are needed now more than ever before. As our ability to inspect the genome increases, so does the variety of abnormalities that we uncover. Understanding the mechanisms of these aberrations to guide additional testing of the parents and genetic counseling of the patients and their families requires the expertise of individuals who are well-versed in meiotic mechanisms and chromosomal structures that may lead to these abnormalities. Cytogeneticists are uniquely positioned to understand these mechanisms and assist genetic counselors and clinicians in their daily interactions with patients and families.","24":"We describe herein the features of a novel cultivation system, combining electrical stimulation with medium perfusion for producing thick, functional cardiac patches. A custom-made electrical stimulator was integrated via inserting two carbon rod electrodes into a perfusion bioreactor, housing multiple neonatal Sprague-Dawley rat cardiac cell constructs between two 96% open-pore-area fixing nets. The stimulator produced adjustable stimulation waveform (i.e., duty cycle, number of stimulating channels, maximum stimulation amplitude, etc.), specially designed for cardiac cell stimulation. The cell constructs were subjected to a homogenous fluid flow regime and electrical stimulation under conditions optimal for cell excitation. The stimulation threshold in the bioreactor was set by first determining its value in a Petri dish under a microscope, and then matching the current density in the two cultivation systems by constructing electric field models. The models were built by Comsol Multiphysics software using the exact three-dimensional geometry of the two cultivation systems. These models illustrate, for the first time, the local electric conditions required for cardiomyocyte field excitation and they confirmed the uniformity of the electrical field around the cell constructs. Bioreactor cultivation for only 4 days under perfusion and continuous electrical stimulus (74.4 mA\/cm(2), 2 ms, bipolar, 1 Hz) promoted cell elongation and striation in the cell constructs and enhanced the expression level of Connexin-43, the gap junction protein responsible for cell-cell coupling. These results thus confirm the validity of the electrical field model in predicting the optimal electrical stimulation in a rather complex cultivation system, a perfusion bioreactor.","25":"From a cognitive science\/artificial intelligence perspective, this paper identifies the scanpath concept as the instantiation of a general sequencing principle that permeates the organization of spatial scene knowledge throughout the levels of mental processing. As such, it helps create methodologies to open up windows onto higher-level cognitive processes, particularly by relating shifts of visual focus to shifts of attention in mental reasoning. The paper argues that these methodologies form a robust basis for smart applications that employ eye movements to assess and to assist in diagrammatic problem solving. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The observed insect behavior, in the context of the insect's sensor-actor system, is formalized as behavioral and motion-sensing meta-models. These meta-models are transformed into a sensor-actor system of micro-robots by means of a sensors virtualization technique. This allows us to keep the efficiency and scalability of the bio-inspired approach. We also demonstrate the systematic character of this re-embodiment procedure on collective aggregation in a real robotic swarm.","27":"Mechanical load and chemical factors as stimuli for the different pattern of the extracellular matrix (ECM) could be responsible for cardiac dysfunction. Since fibroblasts can both synthesize and degrade ECM, ventricular fibroblasts from adult rat hearts underwent cyclical mechanical stretch (CMS; 0.33 Hz) by three different elongations ( 3%,6%, 9%) and four different serum concentrations (0%, 0.5%, 5%, 10%) within 24 h. Expression of collagen I and III, as well as matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP- 2), tissue inhibitor of MMP- 2 (TIMP-2), and colligin were analyzed by RNase protection assay. In the absence of serum, 9% CMS increased the mRNA of collagen I by 1.70- fold and collagen III by 1.64-fold. This increase was prevented by the inhibition either of PKC or of tyrosine kinase but not of PKA. Inhibition of PKC or tyrosine kinase itself reduced the expression of collagen I and collagen III mRNA. The mRNA of MMP- 2, TIMP-2, and colligin showed the same tendency by stretch. Combined with 10% serum, 6% CMS reduced the mRNA of collagen I (0.62-fold) and collagen III ( 0.79fold). Inhibition of PKC or tyrosine kinase, but not of PKA, prevented the reduction of collagen I and collagen III mRNA in 10% serum. The results show that the response of fibroblasts to CMS depends on the serum concentration. At least two signaling pathways are involved in the stretch-induced ECM regulation. Myocardial fibrosis due to ECM remodeling contributes to the dysfunction of the failing heart, which might be attributed to changes in hemodynamic loading.","28":"With the ever-increasing deployment and usage of gigabit networks, traditional networks intrusion detection\/prevention systems (IDSs\/IPSs) have not scaled accordingly. More recently, researchers have been looking at hardware-based solutions that use field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to assist network IDSs\/IPSs, and some proposed systems have been developed that can be scaled to achieve a high speed over 10 Gbps. However, these solutions have certain drawbacks. In this paper, we present a uniform high-speed traffic collection platform for intrusion detection\/prevention based on sampling on FPGAs, called HSTCP. The methodology is when the proposed platform is unable to capture the whole network traffic, it will initiate elephant flow sampling rather than simple packets drop. Meanwhile, the sampling rate is adaptive to the traffic load changes in the elephant flow. The noteworthy features of HSTCP include the following: (a) it takes the self-similarity of network traffic into account with complete mice flows capture and elephant flow sampling; (b) it employs adaptive elephant flow sampling to retain inherent characteristics of network traffic; and (c) it provides a flexible and scalable platform for network IDSs\/IPSs faced to the challenge of the future high-speed network.","29":["A set-up for the calibration of a heterodyne laser-vibrometer is described. By a distinctive optical set-up it is possible to use the laser of the device under test as the single source for the calibration device. In this way many difficulties of the optical adjustment usually encountered in set-ups for laser-vibrometer calibration are avoided and exceptionally low measurement uncertainties are achieved.","This article describes the set-up for the case of a commercially available device which is additionally modified to provide the means for primary traceability. The measurement results are discussed for the analogue output usually used in industrial applications as well as for the output of the photodetector signal, which is used if the device is part of a primary calibration system. Special attention is given to the provisions necessary to achieve low measurement uncertainties."],"30":"Selective marking of a single cell within a living embryo is often difficult due to the inaccuracy and invasiveness of standard techniques. This unit describes a minimally invasive optical protocol that uses 405-nm laser light to photoactivate a variant of green fluorescent protein (PAGFP). This method takes advantage of the accessibility of the chick embryo to inject PAGFP into a region of interest and uses electroporation to deliver the construct into cells. This unit describes in detail how single and small groups of cells (n<10) that express PAGFP can be made visually distinguishable from the host population using the photoactivation process. Included is a means to maximize the fluorescence increase due to photoactivated GFP signal and to reduce photobleaching. Briefly outlined are previously developed chick culture and time-lapse imaging techniques to allow for the subsequent monitoring of photoactivated cell migratory behaviors. The technique has the potential to be a less-invasive, accurate tool for in vivo studies that involve following cell lineage and cell migration.","31":"An extremely simple and inexpensive modification of the Michelson interferometer is presented together with the outlines of a curriculum of physical optics. The most important experiments of optics such as diffraction, interference of light originated by one, or alternatively, by two independent sources and interference of polarized light can be easily arranged for classroom demonstrations without changing instrumentation. A simple and effective experiment to show how the resolution limit of an optical system is diffraction-limited is reported.","32":"The paper addresses the potential benefits of using a field programmable gate array (FPGA) as opposed to a traditional processor for music synthesis. The benefits result from the use of a cellular design, with each cell performing identical operations on its own state and the states of its neighbours. This gives advantages of design simplicity through inherent parallelism. A cellular model which has previously been used for music synthesis is the mass spring paradigm, and this model is implemented on an FPGA. On a sequential processor, the clock speed requirements of this model increase as N-2 (where N is the number of cells), whereas the clock speed requirement increases as Non an FPGA (if the cells can be made small enough that available area on the chip is not a constraint). To make the cells small enough, a bit-serial design was used. This work was performed to advocate the FPGA as a stand-alone live performance music synthesis platform, which has the potential to be reconfigured for example in performance, between synthesis techniques as different sound patches are selected. The paper considers in particular the mass-spring model, because it demonstrates the type of music synthesis technique for which FPGAs provide the greatest potential benefit. The capability to reconfigure combined with the high performance that can be achieved using cellular design suggests that the FPGA is an ideal platform for a live performance hardware music synthesiser, combining the flexibility of software with the speed of a custom ASIC.","33":"The biomechanical environment to which cells are exposed is important to their normal growth, development, interaction, and function. Accordingly, there has been much interest in studying the role of biomechanical forces in cell biology and pathophysiology. This has led to the introduction and even commercialization of many experimental devices. Many of the early devices were limited by the heterogeneity of deformation of cells cultivated in different locations of the culture plate membranes and were also attached with complicated technical\/electronic efforts resulting in a restriction of the reproducibility of these devices. The objective of this study was to design and build a simple device to allow the application of dose-dependent homogeneous equibiaxial static stretch to cells cultured on flexible silicone membranes to investigate biological and biomedical questions. In addition, cultured neonatal rat atrial cardiomyocytes were stretched with the proposed device with different strain gradients. For the first time with this study we could demonstrate that stretch up to 21% caused dose-dependent changes in biological markers such as the calcineurin activity, modulatory calcineurin-interacting protein-1, voltage-gated potassium channel isoform 4.2, and voltage-gated K+ channel-interacting proteins-2 gene expression and transient outward potassium current densities but not the protein-to-DNA ratio and atrial natriuretic peptide mRNA. With both markers mentioned last, dose-dependent stretch alterations could only be achieved with stretch up to 13%. The simple and low-cost device presented here might be applied to a wide range of experimental settings in different fields of research.","34":"Sensemaking involves turning circumstances into a situation that is comprehended explicitly in words and that serves as a springboard into action. In this paper we take the position that the concept of sensemaking fills important gaps in organizational theory. The seemingly transient nature of sensemaking belies its central role in the determination of human behavior, whether people are acting in formal organizations or elsewhere. Sensemaking is central because it is the primary site where meanings materialize that inform and constrain identity and action. The purpose of this paper is to take stock of the concept of sensemaking. We do so by pinpointing central features of sensemaking, some of which have been explicated but neglected, some of which have been assumed but not made explicit, some of which have changed in significance over time, and some of which have been missing all along or have gone awry. We sense joint enthusiasm to restate sensemaking in ways that make it more future oriented, more action oriented, more macro, more closely tied to organizing, meshed more boldly with identity, more visible, more behaviorally defined, less sedentary and backward looking, more infused with emotion and with issues of sensegiving and persuasion. These key enhancements provide a foundation upon which to build future studies that can strengthen the sensemaking perspective.","35":"Economists often assume that a patent gives its owner a well-defined legal right to exclude others from practicing the invention described in the patent. In practice, however, the rights afforded to patent holders are highly uncertain. Under patent law, a patent is no guarantee of exclusion but more precisely a legal right to try to exclude. Since only 0.1% of all patents are litigated to trial, and since nearly half of fully litigated patents are declared invalid, this distinction is critical to understanding the economic impact of patents. The growing recognition among economists and legal scholars that patents are probabilistic property rights has significant implications for our understanding of patents in four important areas: (1) reform of the system by which patents are granted; (2) the legal treatment of patents in litigation; (3) the incentives of patent holders and alleged infringers to settle their disputes through licensing or cross-licensing agreements rather than litigate them to completion; and (4) the antitrust limits on agreements between rivals that settle actual or threatened patent litigation.","36":"The author surveys the entrepreneurial and small business policies from Carter through Clinton, evaluating each based on how they fostered entrepreneurship, or small business ownership, and if these policies seek to create economic efficiency or target market equity for specific groups. It provides a theoretical framework for analyzing each administration's major small business and entrepreneurship policies and examines each policy's overall effects on small business and entrepreneurial activities, its qualifications as a target market equity or economic efficiency policy, and the policy's beneficiaries. This discussion should provide policy makers, researchers, and academics the ability to recognize the types of policies which best foster entrepreneurial and small business activities, and also encourage policy makers to pursue these types of policies.","37":"Both linear and nonlinear transmit precoding strategies based on accurate channel state information (CSI) can significantly increase available throughput in a multiuser wireless system. With propagation delay, infrequent channel updates, lag due to network layer overhead, and time-varying node position or environment characteristics, channel knowledge becomes outdated and CSI-based transmission schemes can experience severe performance degradation. This paper studies the performance of precoding techniques for the multiuser broadcast channel with outdated CSI at the transmitter. Traditional channel models as well as channel realizations measured by a wideband channel sounder are used in the analysis. With measured data from an outdoor urban environment, it is further shown the existence of stable subspaces upon which transmission is possible without any instantaneous CSI at the transmitter. Such transmissions allow for consistent performance curves at the cost of initial suboptimality compared to CSI-based schemes.

The extension board is based on a 32-bit ARM9 microprocessor and provides wireless network support. The ARM9 extension board runs in parallel with the dsPIC microprocessor on the e-puck motherboard with communication between the two via an SPI bus. The extension board is designed to handle computationally intensive image processing, wireless communication and high-level intelligent robot control algorithms, while the dsPIC handles low-level sensor interfacing, data processing and motor control. The extension board runs an embedded Linux operating system, along with a Debian-based port of the root file system stored in a Micro SD card. The extended e-puck robot platform requires minimal effort to integrate the well-known open-source robot control framework Player and, when placed within a TCP\/IP networked infrastructure, provides a powerful and flexible platform for experimental swarm robotics research.

These signals are often generated or recorded via computer software and\/or external dedicated hardware. Dedicated hardware is usually very expensive and requires additional software to control its behavior. In the present article, I present some accuracy tests on a low-cost and open-source I\/O board (Arduino family) that may be useful in many lab environments. One of the strengths of Arduinos is the possibility they afford to load the experimental script on the board's memory and let it run without interfacing with computers or external software, thus granting complete independence, portability, and accuracy. Furthermore, a large community has arisen around the Arduino idea and offers many hardware add-ons and hundreds of free scripts for different projects. Accuracy tests show that Arduino boards may be an inexpensive tool for many psychological and neurophysiological labs.","80":"Typical experiments in psychological and neurophysiological settings often require the accurate control of multiple input and output signals.

This work implements a low-cost teleoperated system to control a humanoid robot, as a first step for further development and study of human motion and walking. A human suit is built, consisting of 8 sensors, 6 resistive linear potentiometers on the lower extremities and 2 digital accelerometers for the arms. The goal is to replicate the suit movements in a small humanoid robot. The data from the sensors is wirelessly transmitted via two ZigBee RF configurable modules installed on each device: the robot and the suit. Replicating the suit movements requires a robot stability control module to prevent falling down while executing different actions involving knees flexion. This is carried out via a feedback control system with an accelerometer placed on the robot's back. The measurement from this sensor is filtered using Kalman. In addition, a two input fuzzy algorithm controlling five servo motors regulates the robot balance. The humanoid robot is controlled by a medium capacity processor and a low computational cost is achieved for executing the different algorithms. Both hardware and software of the system are based on open platforms. The successful experiments carried out validate the implementation of the proposed teleoperated system.","84":"Humanoid robotics is a field of a great research interest nowadays.

We discuss the advanced field programmable gate array (FPGA) signal processing pipeline, with an optimized multi-tap polyphase filter bank algorithm that provides a nearly loss-less time-to-frequency data conversion with significantly reduced frequency scallop and fast sidelobe fall-off. Our digital spectrometers have been proven to be extremely reliable and robust, even under the harsh environmental conditions of an airborne observatory, with Allan-variance stability times of several 1000 s.

Such exponential growth motivates us to ask how data analysis techniques are affected by progressively larger numbers of recorded neurons. Traditionally, neurons are analyzed independently on the basis of their tuning to stimuli or movement. Although tuning curve approaches are unaffected by growing numbers of simultaneously recorded neurons, newly developed techniques that analyze interactions between neurons become more accurate and more complex as the number of recorded neurons increases. Emerging data analysis techniques should consider both the computational costs and the potential for more accurate models associated with this exponential growth of the number of recorded neurons.","100":"Dual sideband (2SB) receivers are well suited for the spectral observation of complex astronomical signals over a wide frequency range. They are extensively used in radio astronomy, their main advantages being to avoid spectral confusion and to diminish effective system temperature by a factor 2 with respect to double sideband (DSB) receivers. Using available millimeter-wave analog technology, wideband 2SB receivers generally obtain sideband rejection ratios (SRR) of 10-15 dB, insufficient for a number of astronomical applications. We report here the design and implementation of an FPGA-based sideband separating FFT spectrometer. A 4 GHz analog front end was built to test the design and measure sideband rejection. The setup uses a 2SB front end architecture, except that the mixer outputs are directly digitized before the IF hybrid, using two 8 bit ADCs sampling at 1 GSPS. The IF hybrid is implemented on the FPGA together with a set of calibration vectors that, properly chosen, compensate for the analog front end amplitude and phase imbalances. The calibrated receiver exhibits a sideband rejection ratio in excess of 40 dB for the entire 2 GHz RF bandwidth.","101":"We are entering a new era in our ability to modify and edit the genomes of model organisms. Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) opened the door to the first custom nuclease-targeted genome engineering in the late 1990s. However, ZFNs remained out of reach for most research labs because of the difficulty of production, high costs, and modest efficacy in many applications. Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) were built upon a DNA binding system discovered in a group of plant bacterial pathogens and broadened custom nuclease technology, showing significant improvements in both targeting flexibility and efficiency. Perhaps most importantly, TALENs are open source and easy to produce, providing zebrafish laboratories around the world with affordable tools that can be made in-house rapidly, at low cost, and with reliably high activity. Now a new system for targeted genome engineering derived from the CRISPR\/Cas system in eubacteria and archaea promises to simplify this process further. Together, these tools will help overcome many of the bottlenecks that have constrained gene targeting in zebrafish, paving the way for advanced genome engineering applications in this model teleost.","102":"We are entering a new era in our ability to modify and edit the genomes of model organisms.

Despite the advances in smart sensor technologies, on-board computing capability of smart sensors has been considered as one of the most difficult challenges in the application of the smart sensors in SHM. Taking the advantage of recent developments in microprocessor which provides powerful on-board computing functionality for smart sensors, this paper presents a new decentralized data processing approach for modal identification using the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) algorithm, which is based on signal decomposition technique. It is shown that this method is suitable for implementation in the intrinsically distributed computing environment found in wireless smart sensor networks (WSSNs). The HHT-based decentralized data processing is, then, programmed and implemented on the Crossbow IRIS mote sensor platform. The effectiveness of the proposed techniques is demonstrated through a set of numerical studies and experimental validations on an in-house cable-stayed bridge model in terms of the accuracy of identified dynamic properties.","110":"Smart wireless sensors have been recognized as a promising technology to overcome many inherent difficulties and limitations associated with traditional wired structural health monitoring (SHM) systems.

It seeks to show how retrocomputing serves the goals of collection and preservation, particularly in regards to historic software, and how retrocomputing practices challenge traditional notions of authenticity. It then seeks to propose an alternative conceptualization and suggest new avenues for collaboration between retrocomputing practitioners and memory institutions.","Design\/methodology\/approach - The paper is based on extensive observation of retrocomputing projects, conducted primarily online.","Findings - Retrocomputing includes many activities that can be seen as constituting collection and preservation. At the same time, it is often transformative, producing assemblages that \"remix\" fragments from the past with newer elements or joining together historic components that were never combined before. While such \"remix\" may seem to undermine preservation, it also allows for fragments of computing history to be reintegrated into a living, ongoing practice, contributing to preservation in a broader sense. The seemingly unorganized nature of retrocomputing assemblages also provides space for alternative \"situated knowledges\" and histories of computing, which can sometimes be quite sophisticated.","Research limitations\/implications - Retrocomputing challenges established notions of collection and preservation. A \"situated knowledges\" perspective provides a possible resolution. Practical implications - Retrocomputing presents memory institutions (and libraries in particular) with an opportunity for new forms of collaboration in collection and preservation of software applications.","Originality\/value - The paper puts at the center the ways in which retrocomputing challenges the established notions of collection and preservation. It offers alternative conceptualizations that suggest new forms of collaboration."],"114":"Through the case of the Helix_T wind turbine project, this article sets out to argue two points: first, on a theoretical level, that Commons-based peer production, in conjunction with the emerging technological capabilities of three-dimensional printing, can also produce promising hardware, globally designed and locally produced. Second, the Commons-oriented wind turbine examined here is also meant to practically contribute to the quest for novel solutions to the timely problem of the need for (autonomous) renewable sources of energy, more in the sense of a development process than as a ready-to-apply solution.

Given the trends and trajectories both of the current information-based paradigm and the problems of the predominant industrial modes of production with all the collateral damage they entail, this may be considered a positive message indeed.","115":"Through the case of the Helix_T wind turbine project, this article sets out to argue two points: first, on a theoretical level, that Commons-based peer production, in conjunction with the emerging technological capabilities of three-dimensional printing, can also produce promising hardware, globally designed and locally produced.

The emergence of consensus towards specific behavioural strategies is examined, with a particular focus on algorithmic stability.

LDI can measure the particle velocity of a small (0.03 mm(2)) element of the surface of the sample along the direction of the laser beam. By measuring the particle velocity of the same surface element in three linearly independent directions and then transforming those velocities to Cartesian coordinates, three orthogonal components of the particle-velocity vector are obtained. Thus, LDI can be used as a localized three-component (3C) receiver of ultrasonic waves, and, together with a piezoelectric transducer as a source, it can simulate a 3C seismic experiment in the laboratory. Performing such 3C measurements at various locations on the surface of the sample produces a 3C seismogram, which can be used to separate the P-wave and two S-waves and to find the polarizations and traveltimes of those waves. Then, the elasticity tensor of the medium can be obtained by minimizing the misfit between measured and predicted polarizations and traveltimes. Computation of the polarizations and traveltimes of body waves inside a sample with a given elasticity tensor is based on the Christoffel equation. The predicted polarizations on the surface then are obtained using the anisotropic Zoeppritz equations.

However, it may be argued that the most potent advances in healing have been in organization of care. Technologies are now emerging that may allow further enhancements of organization and integration of care while also bringing in much needed bedside, chairside, and in-home diagnostics to identify key points in healing and potential early warning signs for recurrence. This article reviews what are believed to be 6 key areas of change over the next generation. These include portability, durability, automation, intelligence, ubiquity, and afford-ability, all yielding specific advances in wound diagnostics. The authors believe that devices will be organized into personal health servers in cloud-synchronized devices already existing in the home (eg, a scale), the clinic, and on (or in) the patient.","156":"The rise of solar photovoltaic (PV) technology as a driver of rural electrification in the developing world and a contributor to climate change mitigation suggests that innovations enhancing PV efficiency and scalability could make considerable strides in reducing both poverty and greenhouse gas emissions. The nearly global access to the solar resource coupled to innovation-driven decreases in the costs of PV provides a path for a renewable energy source to accelerate sustainable development. Open-source software development has proven to produce reliable and innovative computer code at lower costs than proprietary software through sharing development responsibility with a large community of invested individuals. Concepts of open-source design have been applied to other fields in an attempt to reap the same benefits realized within software development: however, applying open-source strategies to solar PV research is uncommon. This paper reviews and examines how open-source design can be utilized to catalyze rapid innovation in the PV industry. The results show how successful open design and development methods can be created and utilized by identifying business models that provide PV researchers, turnkey suppliers and solar PV module manufacturers with the opportunity to utilize open-source design principles to accelerate innovation.

Despite the widespread use of chronic electrophysiology, the precise positioning of recording electrodes required for high-quality recordings remains a challenge, especially in behaving mice. The complexity of available drive mechanisms, combined with restrictions on implant weight tolerated by mice, limits current methods to recordings from no more than 4-8 electrodes in a single target area. We developed a highly miniaturized yet simple drive design that can be used to independently position 16 electrodes with up to 64 channels in a package that weighs ~2 g. This advance over current designs is achieved by a novel spring-based drive mechanism that reduces implant weight and complexity. The device is easy to build and accommodates arbitrary spatial arrangements of electrodes. Multiple optical fibers can be integrated into the recording array and independently manipulated in depth. Thus, our novel design enables precise optogenetic control and highly parallel chronic recordings of identified single neurons throughout neural circuits in mice.","165":"Given that open innovation web-based platforms (OIPs) allow for the collaboration of individuals and companies, this paper focuses on exploring the motivations for participating and collaborating in OIPs.

Finally, literature does not consider the differences related to different members and to different phases of the innovation process. First, we base the literature on open innovation on the Internet (crowdsourcing, peer production and open source) to identify the potential motivations. We then deeply analyse 116 OIPs to determine if the motivations can be a function of the phase of innovation and the dependency on members. We show that the design of the motivational system should take into consideration the different stages of the innovation process and that the OIPs should consider moving from 'work place' logic to 'social place' logic.","166":"Given that open innovation web-based platforms (OIPs) allow for the collaboration of individuals and companies, this paper focuses on exploring the motivations for participating and collaborating in OIPs.

This frequently results in the students early disengagement from the subject of their degrees which in turn can lead to excessive wastage, that is, reduced retention. In this paper, we report on our academic groups attempts within creative computing degrees at a UK university to counter these problems through the introduction of a 6 week long project that newly enrolled students embark on at the very beginning of their studies. This group project, involving the creation of a 3D etch-a-sketch-like computer graphics application with a hardware interface, provides a breadth-first, activity-led introduction to the students chosen academic discipline, aiming to increase student engagement while providing a stimulating learning experience with the overall goal to increase retention.

In this paper, we report on our academic groups attempts within creative computing degrees at a UK university to counter these problems through the introduction of a 6 week long project that newly enrolled students embark on at the very beginning of their studies. This group project, involving the creation of a 3D etch-a-sketch-like computer graphics application with a hardware interface, provides a breadth-first, activity-led introduction to the students chosen academic discipline, aiming to increase student engagement while providing a stimulating learning experience with the overall goal to increase retention.

This reflects the assumption that the mapping between sensor signal patterns and activity classes is known at design-time. This cannot be guaranteed in mobile and pervasive computing, where unpredictable changes can often occur in open-ended environments. Run-time adaptation can address these issues. We introduce and formalize a data processing architecture extending current approaches that allows for a wide range of realizations of adaptive activity recognition systems. The adaptive activity recognition chain (adARC) includes self-monitoring, adaptation strategies and external feedback as components of the now closed-loop recognition system. We show an adARC capable of unsupervised self-adaptation to run-time changing class distributions. It improves activity recognition accuracy when sensors suffer from on-body displacement. We show an adARC capable of adaptation to changing sensor setups. It allows for scalability by enabling a recognition systems to autonomously exploit newly introduced sensors. We discuss other adaptive recognition systems within the adARC architecture. The results outline that this architecture frames a useful solution space for the real-world deployment of adaptive activity recognition systems. It allows to present and compare recognition systems in a coherent and modular manner. We discuss the challenges and new research directions resulting from this new perspective on adaptive activity recognition.","182":"Most approaches to recognize human activities rely on pattern recognition techniques that are trained once at design time, and then remain unchanged during usage.

However, the large volume of acoustic data and the lengthy and laborious task of manually analyzing these data have hindered broad application of this technique. To overcome these limitations, a generalized automated detection and classification system (DCS) was developed to efficiently and accurately identify low-frequency baleen whale calls. The DCS (1) accounts for persistent narrowband and transient broadband noise, (2) characterizes temporal variation of dominant call frequencies via pitch-tracking, and (3) classifies calls based on attributes of the resulting pitch tracks using quadratic discriminant function analysis (QDFA). Automated detections of sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis) downsweep calls and North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) upcalls were evaluated using recordings collected in the southwestern Gulf of Maine during the spring seasons of 2006 and 2007. The accuracy of the DCS was similar to that of a human analyst: variability in differences between the DCS and an analyst was similar to that between independent analysts, and temporal variability in call rates was similar among the DCS and several analysts.

In this article the working parameters of the system were established to guarantee the realization of spatially controlled hydrogel scaffolds. Moreover the shear stresses acting on the cell membrane during extrusion was investigated through a computational fluid-dynamic analysis. The computational models show that the shear stress on the cells is of the order of 100 Pa during the extrusion process. HepG2 cells encapsulated in alginate were then extruded into spatially organized hepatic lobule-like architectures and their viability and function were evaluated. The results show that the metabolic fingerprint of the cells is preserved with respect to controls and the cells are uniformly distributed through the gel scaffold.","194":"Rapid prototyping techniques are widely used to fabricate well-defined three-dimensional structures of tissue homologs.

The proliferation marker, Ki-67, detected in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and 3-[4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide cytotoxicity assay performed on human atrial fibroblasts confirmed biocompatibility of this novel device. Cyclic stretch treatment for 24 h resulted in the perpendicular alignment of human atrial fibroblasts. An electrical stimulation system containing carbon electrodes was characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and charge injection\/recovery studies, which indicated that increased corrosive reactions were associated with a higher input voltage and prolonged pulse duration. Field stimulation delivered through this system could induce rhythmic contractions in adult rat ventricular myocytes, with contractile characteristics similar to those paced in a standard field stimulation chamber. In conclusion, this bioreactor provides a novel tool to study the interaction between physical stimulation and cardiac cell physiology.","203":"To simulate the cardiac niche, a bioreactor system was designed and constructed to incorporate cyclic stretch, rhythmic electrical stimulation, and constant perfusion.

Here, we propose detectability of scale-freeness as a benchmark to evaluate time-series extraction settings. Scale-freeness, i.e., power-law distribution of node connections, is a fundamental topological property that is highly conserved across biological networks, and as such needs to be manifest within plausible reconstructions of brain connectivity.

One reason for the low penetration of potentiostats is their cost, as even the least expensive commercially available laboratory potentiostats sell for more than one thousand dollars. An inexpensive electrochemical workstation could thus prove useful in educational labs, and increase access to electrochemistry-based analytical techniques for food, drug and environmental monitoring. With these motivations in mind, we describe here the CheapStat, an inexpensive (<$80), open-source (software and hardware), hand-held potentiostat that can be constructed by anyone who is proficient at assembling circuits. This device supports a number of potential waveforms necessary to perform cyclic, square wave, linear sweep and anodic stripping voltammetry. As we demonstrate, it is suitable for a wide range of applications ranging from food-and drug-quality testing to environmental monitoring, rapid DNA detection, and educational exercises. The device's schematics, parts lists, circuit board layout files, sample experiments, and detailed assembly instructions are available in the supporting information and are released under an open hardware license.","220":"Aiming to high sensitivity and wide spectrum of cosmic ray detection, the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) project consists of over 10,000 detectors of different types, spreading over 12 km(2). To precisely reconstruct the an shower events with high angular resolution, all detector electronics and digitizers should work in synchronous acquisition mode with a global timing error less than < 5 ns (rms). This large scale and high precision timing requirement exceeds the capability or feasibility of traditional methods such as GPS and echo-delay calibration. Recently an emerging method named White Rabbit (WR) was proposed and demonstrated as a cost-effective solution that combines Gigabit Ethernet data transfer and subnanosecond precision Liming transfer over the same fiber media. Furthermore, the White Rabbit network also enables direct digitization and trigger-less data acquisition mode for each detector, which will greatly reduce the complexity and improve the performance of the data acquisition (DAQ) system. In this paper we will demonstrate the design and development status of a WR Liming and DAQ network in the LHAASO project.

The proposed function-based procedural representation provides compact, precise, and arbitrarily parametrized models of coherent microstructures, which can undergo blending, deformations, and other geometric operations, and can be directly rendered and fabricated without generating any auxiliary representations (such as polygonal meshes and voxel arrays). In particular, modelling of regular lattices and cellular microstructures as well as irregular porous media is discussed and illustrated. We also present a method to estimate parameters of the given model by fitting it to microstructure data obtained with magnetic resonance imaging and other measurements of natural and artificial objects. Examples of rendering and digital fabrication of microstructure models are presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The extension may be used to transform what is traditionally a swarm robotics platform into a self-reconfigurable modular robotic system. We introduce a modified version of a previously developed collective locomotion algorithm and present new experimental results across three different themes. We begin by investigating how the performance of the collective locomotion algorithm is affected by the size and shape of the robotic structures involved, examining structures containing up to nine modules. Without alteration to the underlying algorithm, we then analyse the implicit self-assembling and self-reconfiguring capabilities of the system and show that the novel use of 'virtual sensors' can significantly improve performance. Finally, by examining a form of environment driven self-reconfiguration, we observe the behaviour of the system in a more complex environment. We conclude that the modular e-puck extension represents a viable platform for investigating collective locomotion, self-assembly and self-reconfiguration.","223":"A 2-week long theoretical and practical course on innovative microscopy in the field of microbial infection was organized in Pretoria, South Africa.

The cost of instrumentation, however, limits measurement frequency and number of sensors. The objective of this work was to design a low cost. open hardware. platform for multi-sensor measurements including water content at different depths, air and soil temperatures. The system is based on an open-source ARDUINO microcontroller-board, programmed in a simple integrated development environment (IDE). Low cost high-frequency dielectric probes were used in the platform and lab tested on three non-saline soils (ECe1: 2.5 < 0.1 mS\/cm). Empirical calibration curves were subjected to cross-validation (leave-one-out method), and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) were respectively 0.09 for the overall model, 0.09 for the sandy soil, 0.07 for the clay loam and 0.08 for the sandy loam. The overall model (pooled soil data) fitted the data very well (R-2 = 0.89) showing a high stability, being able to generate very similar RMSEs during training and validation (RMSEtraining = 2.63; RMSEvalidation = 2.61). Data recorded on the card were automatically sent to a remote server allowing repeated field-data quality checks. This work provides a framework for the replication and upgrading of a customized low cost platform, consistent with the open source approach whereby sharing information on equipment design and software facilitates the adoption and continuous improvement of existing technologies.","226":"This chapter illustrates how to set up an inexpensive but effective Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) platform for the test of wind turbine (WT) controllers. The dynamics of the WT are simulated on the open-source National Renewable Energy Laboratory WT simulator called FAST (Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structures, and Turbulence), which emulates all required input signals of the controller and reacts to the controller commands (almost) like an onshore real turbine of 5 MW. The dynamic torque control system runs on an open hardware Arduino microcontroller board, which is connected to the virtual WT via USB. In particular, the power generation control in the full load region for variable-speed variable-pitch wind turbines is considered through torque and pitch control. The HIL proposed platform is used to characterize the behavior of the WT in normal operation as well as in fault operation. In particular, a stuck\/unstuck fault is modeled and the behavior of a proposed chattering torque controller is analyzed in comparison to a baseline torque controller.","227":"Rapid prototyping is a key aspect for the development of innovative robotic applications. A modular, platform-based, approach is the way to obtain this result. Modular approaches are common for software development, but hardware is still crafted often re-inventing solutions every time. As a consequence, the resources that should be invested in the development of a new robot get often drained by the implementation of a physical, working prototype to test the application idea. To overcome this problem, we propose R2P (Rapid Robot Prototyping), a framework to implement real-time, high-quality architectures for robotic systems with off-the-shelf basic modules (e.g., sensors, actuators, and controllers), integrating hardware and software, which can be assembled in a plug-and-play way. R2P provides hardware modules, a protocol for real-time communication, a middleware to connect components as well as tools to support the development of software on the modules. R2P aims at dramatically reduce time and efforts required to build a prototype robot, making it possible to focus the resources on the development of new robotic applications instead of struggling on their implementation. This enables also people with experience in a specific application domain, but with little technical background, to actively participate in the development of new robotic applications. R2P is open-source both in its software and hardware to promote its diffusion among the robotics community and novel business models that will substantially reduce the costs to design a new robotic product.

Second, the hybrid 3D printing-milling machine demonstrates the digitization of material and the potential of digital fabrication.

The aim is to control a large number of simple robots in order to solve common complex tasks. Due to the hardware complexities and cost of robot platforms, current research in swarm robotics is mostly performed by simulation software. The simulation of large numbers of these robots in robotic swarm applications is extremely complex and often inaccurate due to the poor modelling of external conditions. In this paper, we present the design of a low-cost, open platform autonomous micro robot (Colias) for robotic swarm applications. Colias employs a circular platform with a diameter of 4 cm. It has a maximum speed of 35 cm\/s which enables it to be used in swarm scenarios very quickly over large arenas. Long-range infrared modules with an adjustable output power allow the robot to communicate with its direct neighbours at a range of 0.5 cm to 2 m. Colias has been designed as a complete platform with supporting software development tools for robotics education and research. It has been tested in both individual and swarm scenarios, and the observed results demonstrate its feasibility for use as a micro-sized mobile robot and as a low-cost platform for robot swarm applications.","230":"The emergence of the Internet of Things increases the demand on embedded computer systems, which in turn requires the availability of specialized engineers in the near future. Several universities commenced embedded-systems programming courses to complement students' skills by introducing specific firmware development techniques. Hands-on labs with real hardware interaction is restricted to the time students are in the laboratory whilst virtual-laboratories provide more flexibility at the caveat that students do not improve hardware manipulation skills as they cannot physically inter-actuate with real devices. We argue that students' abilities can be increased by providing them with a sensor board with reduced computation and communication capabilities to work with at home. Students increase the time spent manipulating the device; moreover, their motivation is also increased as they can put their effort on developments of their interest. The article presents the experience carried out at the virtual-course of Embedded-Systems at the UOC.

The MAV is able to perform stereo matching for each camera pair on-board and in real-time, using an efficient sparse stereo method. In case of the camera pair that is facing forward, the stereo matching results are used for a reduced stereo SLAM system. The other camera pair, which is facing downwards, is used for ground plane detection and tracking. Hence, we are able to obtain a full 6DoF pose estimate from each camera pair, which we fuse with inertial measurements in an extended Kalman filter. Special care is taken to compensate various drift errors. In an evaluation we show that using two instead of one camera pair significantly increases the pose estimation accuracy and robustness.","232":"In this article, we present and articulate the analytical lens of multisited design to illuminate transnational connections between sites of design, and aid in the translation of knowledge between designers and ethnographers. This position emerges from the authors' respective engagements in ethnographic research and design engagements with a slum community center in Bangkok, Thailand, and with makers and entrepreneurs in Shanghai and Shenzhen, China. In both cases, we found design to be a site of engagement with and interpretation of wider connections between different locales, and between local and global networks. We identify four crucial aspects of design for the purposes of this discussion: It is normative, concerned with function and the attainment of goals; it is practical, and oriented toward constraints and opportunities; it frames and defines problems concurrently with solving them; and it takes a systems approach that accounts for the broad context of the design situation. Approaching and participating in these aspects of design evolved in concert with our ethnographic fieldwork and analysis, allowing us to take design seriously without sacrificing an ethnographic commitment to nuanced description. We conclude by touching on the epistemological similarities, rather than conflicts, between ethnography and design.","233":["Background: The zebrafish has been established as the main vertebrate model system for whole organism screening applications. However, the lack of consistent positioning of zebrafish embryos within wells of microtiter plates remains an obstacle for the comparative analysis of images acquired in automated screening assays. While technical solutions to the orientation problem exist, dissemination is often hindered by the lack of simple and inexpensive ways of distributing and duplicating tools.","Results: Here, we provide a cost effective method for the production of 96-well plate compatible zebrafish orientation tools using a desktop 3D printer. The printed tools enable the positioning and orientation of zebrafish embryos within cavities formed in agarose. Their applicability is demonstrated by acquiring lateral and dorsal views of zebrafish embryos arrayed within microtiter plates using an automated screening microscope. This enables the consistent visualization of morphological phenotypes and reporter gene expression patterns.","Conclusions: The designs are refined versions of previously demonstrated devices with added functionality and strongly reduced production costs. All corresponding 3D models are freely available and digital design can be easily shared electronically. In combination with the increasingly widespread usage of 3D printers, this provides access to the developed tools to a wide range of zebrafish users. Finally, the design files can serve as templates for other additive and subtractive fabrication methods."],"234":null,"235":"Open innovation research and practice recognize the important role of external complementors in value creation. At the same time, firms need to retain exclusive control over some essential components to capture value from their product and\/or service system. This paper contributes to the literature by analyzing some of the trade-offs between openness to external value creation and closedness for internal value capture. It focuses on selective openness as a key variable and investigates how it affects value creation by external complementors, specifically the members of user innovation communities. Openness, it is hypothesized, matters to community members: The more open a product design is, the higher their sense of involvement in the innovation project, and the larger the effort they devote to it. Unlike prior literature, different forms and loci of openness are distinguished, specifically the transparency, accessibility, and replicability of different components of the product being developed. Hypotheses are tested based on survey data (n=309) from 20 online communities in the consumer electronics and information technology hardware industries. Multilevel regression analysis is used to account for clustering, and thus nonindependent data, at the community level. We find that openness indeed increases community members' involvement in the innovation project and their contributions to it. Interestingly, however, some forms and loci of openness strongly affect community perceptions and behavior, while others have limited or no impact. This finding suggests that, at least in relation to user communities, the trade-off that firms face between external value creation and internal value capture is softer than hitherto understood. Contingency factors that may be able to explain these patterns are advanced. For example, users are expected to value the form of openness that they have the capabilities and incentives to exploit. The findings in this paper extend the literature on selective openness in innovation. They emphasize the need to study the demand for different forms of openness at the subsystem level and align supply-side strategies to it. In managerial practice, a careful assessment of the demand for openness enables firms to successfully use selective openness and to effectively appropriate value from selectively open systems.","236":["Objective: Create a visual mobile end user development framework, named Puzzle, which allows end users without IT background to create, modify and execute applications, and provides support for interaction with smart things, phone functions and web services.","Methods: Design of an intuitive visual metaphor and associated interaction techniques for supporting end user development in mobile devices with iterative empirical validation.","Results: Our results show that the jigsaw is an intuitive metaphor for development in a mobile environment and our interaction techniques required a limited cognitive effort to use and learn the framework.

The second is an academic-led project using environmental sensors to engage disparate audiences in scientific practice. These two projects were found to differ in their ability to form strategic spaces for community-based science, and suggest pathways to foster more robust relationships across the public-academic divide.

In this scenario, new concerns appear with respect to safety certification of the resulting mixed-criticality systems (e.g. temporal and spatial isolation). This article describes the research effort that is being conducted within the FP7 MultiPARTES project, which is one of the initiatives launched by the European Commission to explore new solutions for developing certifiable mixed-criticality systems using heterogeneous multi-cores.

Furthermore, we describe the uncertainty on the position of each pixel in the corrected image with respect to the accelerometer noise. Experimental results show a similar accuracy for a smartphone and for a digital reflex camera.

After transurethral injection of ICG into rats through a catheter, their bladders were photoacoustically and fluorescently visualized.

With the increasing popularity of open-source processes for developing both software and physical systems, there is a need to develop computational models of product evolution in such dynamic product developments scenarios. Existing studies on the evolution of products involve modeling products as networks, taking snapshots of the structure at different time steps, and comparing the structural characteristics. Such approaches are limited because they do not capture the underlying dynamics through which products evolve. In this paper, we take a step toward addressing this gap by presenting a generative network model for product evolution. The generative model is based on different mechanisms though which networks evolve-addition and removal of nodes, addition and removal of links. The model links local network observations to global network structures. It is utilized for modeling and analyzing the evolution of a software product (Drupal) and a physical product (RepRap) developed by open source processes. For the software product, the generated networks are compared with the actual product structures using various network measures including average degree, density, clustering coefficients, average shortest path, propagation cost, clustered cost, and degree distributions. For the physical product, the product evolution is analyzed in terms of the proposed mechanisms. The proposed model has three general applications: longitudinal studies of a product's evolution, cross-sectional studies of evolution of different products, and predictive analyzes.","250":"In order to construct a green-light-regulated gene expression system for cyanobacteria, we characterized a green-light sensing system derived from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, consisting of the green-light sensing histidine kinase CcaS, the cognate response regulator CcaR, and the promoter of cpcG2 (P-cpcG2). CcaS and CcaR act as a genetic controller and activate gene expression from P-cpcG2 with green-light illumination. The green-light induction level of the native P-cpcG2 was investigated using GFPuv as a reporter gene inserted in a broad-host-range vector. A clear induction of protein expression from native P-cpcG2 under green-light illumination was observed; however, the expression level was very low compared with P-trc, which was reported to act as a constitutive promoter in cyanobacteria. Therefore, a Shine-Dalgarno-like sequence derived from the cpcB gene was inserted in the 5 untranslated region of the cpcG2 gene, and the expression level of CcaR was increased. Thus, constructed engineered green-light sensing system resulted in about 40-fold higher protein expression than with the wild-type promoter with a high ON\/OFF ratio under green-light illumination. The engineered green-light gene expression system would be a useful genetic tool for controlling gene expression in the emergent cyanobacterial bioprocesses.","251":"Geosensor networks and sensor webs are two technologies widely used for determining our exposure to pollution levels and ensuring that this information is publicly available.

This paper presents a java-compatible platform for wireless sensor networks which provides a thorough support to preemptive multitasking while allowing the programmers to write their applications in java. The proposed approach has been implemented and tested on top of VirtualSense, an ultra-low-power wireless sensor mote providing a java-compatible runtime environment.

In this review, I discuss the implementation of CG models for biologically relevant systems, and show how such models can be optimised and perform well on GPU-accelerated hardware. Several examples of GPU implementations of CG models for both molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations on purely GPU and hybrid CPU\/GPU architectures are presented.

The sensation of touching virtual objects not only augments the impression of reality but also can improve the performance. However, the design of haptic interactions is not an easy task, and it usually needs a great effort due to the absence of powerful prototyping toolkits. Thus, this article proposes a vibrotactile prototyping toolkit for Eccentric Rotating Mass actuators named VITAKI. The main objective of this platform is to facilitate the prototyping and testing procedures of new vibrotactile interaction techniques for Virtual Reality and video games. A detailed description of the design of the system is provided, presenting the hardware and software elements that make up the VITAKI toolkit. In addition, its application to two different examples to illustrate its use is provided. Finally, a preliminary evaluation of this toolkit is presented. This evaluation is divided into two main stages. On one hand, a study of Olsen's criteria is performed to analyze its general capabilities. On the other hand, a comparison with previously presented proposals is included too.

The hyperspectral images were subjected to partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) to classify and detect cracks on the tomatoes. Two morphological features, roundness (R) and minimum-maximum distance (D), were calculated from the PLS-DA images to quantify the shape of the stem scar. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and a support vector machine (SVM) were then used to classify R and D. The results revealed 94.6% and 96.4% accuracy for classifications made using LDA and SVM, respectively, for tomatoes with and without crack defects. These data suggest that the hyperspectral near-infrared reflectance imaging system, in addition to traditional NIR spectroscopy-based methods, could potentially be used to detect crack defects on tomatoes and perform quality assessments.","256":null,"257":"Vessel maintenance entails periodic visual inspections of the internal and external parts of the hull in order to detect the typical defective situations affecting metallic structures, such as coating breakdown, corrosion, cracks, etc. The main goal of project MINOAS is the automation of the inspection process, currently undertaken by human surveyors, by means of a fleet of robotic agents. This paper overviews an approach to the inspection problem based on an autonomous Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) which, as part of this fleet, is in charge of regularly supplying images that can teleport the surveyor from a base station to the areas of the hull to be inspected. The control software approach adopted for the MAV is fully described, with a special emphasis on the self-localization capabilities of the vehicle. Experimental results showing the suitability of the platform to the application are as well reported and discussed.","258":"Aggregation in swarm robotics is referred to as the gathering of spatially distributed robots into a single aggregate. Aggregation can be classified as cue-based or self-organized. In cue-based aggregation, there is a cue in the environment that points to the aggregation area, whereas in self-organized aggregation no cue is present. In this paper, we proposed a novel fuzzy-based method for cue-based aggregation based on the state-of-the-art BEECLUST algorithm. In particular, we proposed three different methods: naive, that uses a deterministic decision-making mechanism; vector-averaging, using a vectorial summation of all perceived inputs; and fuzzy, that uses a fuzzy logic controller. We used different experiment settings: one-source and two-source environments with static and dynamic conditions to compare all the methods. We observed that the fuzzy method outperformed all the other methods and it is the most robust method against noise.","259":"A distributed multistage software router (MSSR) is composed by several interconnected software routers running on personal computers (PCs). The MSSR architecture overcomes scalability and performance issues of single software router by providing parallel forwarding paths. Like many networking devices, a MSSR must be sized for peak traffic load, which implies energy inefficiency at low loads. Thus, we focus on energy saving schemes to improve the router energy efficiency by dynamically adapting the MSSR architecture to the currently offered load. We first introduce an optimal energy saving algorithm defined as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) optimization model. Then, heuristic solutions, named differential algorithms are discussed. While the optimal approach provides higher energy savings, the heuristics avoid the complete MSSR reconfiguration, thus reducing forwarding delays and minimizing service interruption. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed heuristic algorithms, that gracefully modifies the internal MSSR configuration, preserve the load proportional energy demand characteristics of the optimal algorithm, with a minimal loss of efficiency, largely compensated by algorithm simplicity.

In this situation, the beam-tracking technique purely based on the received signal is not effective because both behavioral changes (rotation, displacement) and environmental changes (blockage) result in power loss in the received signal. In this paper, a motion sensor based on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) as well as an electrical signal is used for beam tracking to identify the cause of beam error, and an efficient beam-tracking technique is proposed. The motion sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and geo-magnetic sensor are composed of an attitude heading reference system (AHRS) and a zero-velocity detector (ZVD). The AHRS estimates the rotation angle and the ZVD detects whether the device moves. The proposed technique tracks a beam by handling the specific situation depending on the cause of beam error, minimizing the tracking overhead. The performance of the proposed beam-tracking technique is evaluated by simulations in three typical scenarios.","261":"As additive manufacturing of mechanical parts gains broad acceptance, efforts to embed electronic or electromechanical components in these parts are intensifying. We discuss recent work in printable electronics and introduce an alternative, which we call Bitblox. Bitblox are small, modular, interconnecting blocks that embed simple electromechanical connectivity and functionality. Not all blocks are identical; instead the unique combinations and positions of Bitblox within an assembly determine the mechanical and electrical properties of the assembly. We describe the design details of Bitblox, compare them to similar materials, and demonstrate their use in a working three-dimensional printer through several examples.","262":"Internet broadband access is becoming a reality in many countries.

In operando characterization of such devices by scanning probe techniques is particularly well-suited for the microscopic study of these properties. We have developed a scanning probe microscope (SPM) which is capable of both standard force imaging (atomic, magnetic, electrostatic) and simultaneous electrical transport measurements. We utilize flexible and inexpensive FPGA (field-programmable gate array) hardware and a custom software framework developed in National Instrument's LabVIEW environment to perform the various aspects of microscope operation and device measurement. The FPGA-based approach enables sensitive, real-time cantilever frequency-shift detection. Using this system, we demonstrate electrostatic force microscopy of an electrically biased graphene field-effect transistor device. The combination of SPM and electrical transport also enables imaging of the transport response to a localized perturbation provided by the scanned cantilever tip. Facilitated by the broad presence of LabVIEW in the experimental sciences and the openness of our software solution, our system permits a wide variety of combined scanning and transport measurements by providing standardized interfaces and flexible access to all aspects of a measurement (input and output signals, and processed data). Our system also enables precise control of timing (synchronization of scanning and transport operations) and implementation of sophisticated feedback protocols, and thus should be broadly interesting and useful to practitioners in the field.

The autonomous MAV is provided with only one single reference image of the landing site with an unknown size before initiating this task. We extend a well-known monocular visual SLAM algorithm that enables autonomous navigation of the MAV in unknown environments, in order to search for such landing sites. Furthermore, a multi-scale ORB feature based method is implemented and integrated into the SLAM framework for landing site detection. We use a RANSAC-based method to locate the landing site within the map of the SLAM system, taking advantage of those map points associated with the detected landing site. We demonstrate the efficiency of the presented vision system in autonomous flights, both indoor and in challenging outdoor environment.","267":null,"268":"Electrical stimulation (ES) of cells has been shown to induce a variety of responses, such as cytoskeleton rearrangements, migration, proliferation, and differentiation. In this study, we have investigated whether monophasic and biphasic pulsed ES could exert any effect on the proliferation and differentiation of human cardiac progenitor cells (hCPCs) isolated from human heart fragments. Cells were cultured under continuous exposure to monophasic or biphasic ES with fixed cycles for 1 or 3 days. Results indicate that neither stimulation protocol affected cell viability, while the cell shape became more elongated and reoriented more perpendicular to the electric field direction. Moreover, the biphasic ES clearly induced the upregulation of early cardiac transcription factors, MEF2D, GATA-4, and Nkx2.5, as well as the de novo expression of the late cardiac sarcomeric proteins, troponin T, cardiac alpha actinin, and SERCA 2a. Both treatments increased the expression of connexin 43 and its relocation to the cell membrane, but biphasic ES was faster and more effective. Finally, when hCPCs were exposed to both monophasic and biphasic ES, they expressed de novo the mRNA of the voltage-dependent calcium channel Cav 3.1((1G)) subunit, which is peculiar of the developing heart. Taken together, these results show that ES alone is able to set the conditions for early differentiation of adult hCPCs toward a cardiac phenotype.","269":"In this paper, we present a distributed control strategy, enabling agents to converge onto and travel along a consensually selected curve among a class of closed planar curves. Individual agents identify the number of neighbors within a finite circular sensing range and obtain information from their neighbors through local communication. The information is then processed to update the control parameters and force the swarm to converge onto and circulate along the aforementioned planar curve. The proposed mathematical framework is based on stochastic differential equations driven by white Gaussian noise (diffusion processes). Using this framework, there is maximum probability that the swarm dynamics will be driven toward the consensual closed planar curve. In the simplest configuration where a circular consensual curve is obtained, we are able to derive an analytical expression that relates the radius of the circular formation to the agent's interaction range. Such an intimate relation is also illustrated numerically for more general curves. The agent-based control strategy is then translated into a distributed Braitenberg-inspired one. The proposed robotic control strategy is then validated by numerical simulations and by implementation on an actual robotic swarm. It can be used in applications that involve large numbers of locally interacting agents, such as traffic control, deployment of communication networks in hostile environments, or environmental monitoring.","270":"This paper presents the TraxBot robot and its full integration in the Robotic Operating System (ROS).

At the thing' leveldevices and inter-device network communicationthe core technical building blocks are generally the same as those found in wireless sensor network implementations. For the Internet of Things to continue growing, we need more plentiful resources for building intelligent devices and sensor networks. Unfortunately, current commercial devices, e.g., sensor nodes and network gateways, tend to be expensive and proprietary, which presents a barrier to entry and arguably slows down further development. There are, however, an increasing number of open embedded platforms available and also a wide selection of off-the-shelf components that can quickly and easily be built into device and network gateway solutions. The question is whether these solutions measure up to built-for-purpose devices. In the paper, we provide a comparison of existing built-for-purpose devices against open source devices. For comparison, we have also designed and rapidly prototyped a sensor node based on off-the-shelf components. We show that these devices compare favorably to built-for-purpose devices in terms of performance, power and cost. Using open platforms and off-the-shelf components would allow more developers to build intelligent devices and sensor networks, which could result in a better overall development ecosystem, lower barriers to entry and rapid growth in the number of IoT applications.","272":"The need for constant monitoring of environmental conditions has produced an increase in the development of wireless sensor networks (WSN). The drive towards smart cities has produced the need for smart sensors to be able to monitor what is happening in our cities. This, combined with the decrease in hardware component prices and the increase in the popularity of open hardware, has favored the deployment of sensor networks based on open hardware. The new trends in Internet Protocol (IP) communication between sensor nodes allow sensor access via the Internet, turning them into smart objects (Internet of Things and Web of Things). Currently, WSNs provide data in different formats. There is a lack of communication protocol standardization, which turns into interoperability issues when connecting different sensor networks or even when connecting different sensor nodes within the same network. This work presents a sensorized platform proposal that adheres to the principles of the Internet of Things and the Web of Things. Wireless sensor nodes were built using open hardware solutions, and communications rely on the HTTP\/IP Internet protocols. The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) SensorThings API candidate standard was used as a neutral format to avoid interoperability issues. An environmental WSN developed following the proposed architecture was built as a proof of concept. Details on how to build each node and a study regarding energy concerns are presented.","273":"Non-contacting acoustic and ultrasonic measurements are of interest in applications ranging from nondestructive evaluation to rock physics and medical imaging.

This article demonstrates that when China's makers set up open hardware businesses and articulate a unique culture of hacking with Chinese characteristics, they draw boundaries between the professional making they saw embodied in Chinese industrial production and the hobbyist making embodied in Western histories and cultures of hacking. In so doing, they position China as site of both technological and cultural expertise, intervening in dominant conceptions of computing that split manufacturing and innovation along geographical lines.

Recently low-cost open-source gas metal arc weld (GMAW) RepRap 3D printers have been developed.

The preliminary work on process optimization of GMAW 3D printers requires a low-cost sensor and data logger system to measure welder current and voltage. This paper reports on the development of a low-cost open-source power measurement sensor system based on Arduino architecture. The sensor system was designed, built, and tested with two entry-level MIG welders. The full bill of materials and open source designs are provided. Voltage and current were measured while making stepwise adjustments to the manual voltage setting on the welder. Three conditions were tested while welding with steel and aluminum wire on steel substrates to assess the role of electrode material, shield gas, and welding velocity.

Going forward, funders should consider requiring that educational resources and concomitant data resulting from their sponsorship should be open, as a public good. There are, however, many other forms of open practice that bring value to the GFSP. Nine different open strategies and tactics (Appendix A) are described, including: open content (including OER and open courseware), open data, open access (research), open government, open source software, open standards, open policy, open licensing and open hardware. It is recommended that all stakeholders proactively pursue \"openness\" as an operating principle. This paper presents an overall GFSP Open Ecosystem Engagement Strategy within which specific local case examples can be situated. Two different case examples, China and Colombia, are presented to show both project-based and crowd-sourced, direct-to-public paths through this ecosystem.","295":"To provide process optimization of metal fabricating self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) 3-D printers requires a low-cost sensor and data logger system to measure current (I) and voltage (V) of the gas metal arc welders (GMAW). This paper builds on previous open-source hardware development to provide a real-time measurement of welder I-V where the measuring circuit is connected to two analog inputs of the Arduino that is used to control the 3-D printer itself. Franklin firmware accessed through a web interface that is used to control the printer allows storing the measured values and downloading those stored readings to the user's computer. To test this custom current and voltage monitoring device this study reports on its use on an upgraded all metal RepRap during the printing of aluminum alloy (ER1100, ER4043, ER4943, ER4047, and ER5356). The voltage and current data were analyzed on a per alloy basis and also layer-by-layer in order to evaluate the device's efficacy as a monitoring device for 3-D printing and the results of the integrated design are discussed.","296":"We present a novel approach to developing a vehicle communication platform consisting of a low-cost, open-source hardware for moving vehicle data to a secure server, a Web Application Programming Interface (API) for the provision of third-party services, and an intuitive user dashboard for access control and service distribution. The CloudThink infrastructure promotes the commoditization of vehicle telematics data by facilitating easier, flexible, and more secure access. It enables drivers to confidently share their vehicle information across multiple applications to improve the transportation experience for all stakeholders, as well as to potentially monetize their data. The foundations for an application ecosystem have been developed which, taken together with the fair value for driving data and low barriers to entry, will drive adoption of CloudThink as the standard method for projecting physical vehicles into the cloud. The application space initially consists of a few fundamental and important applications (vehicle tethering and remote diagnostics, road-safety monitoring, and fuel economy analysis) but as CloudThink begins to gain widespread adoption, the multiplexing of applications on the same data structure and set will accelerate its adoption.","297":"We present a design for wireless power transfer, via inductively coupled coils, to a spinning disk. The rectified and stabilised power feeds an Arduino-compatible microcontroller (mu C) on the disc, which in turn drives and monitors various sensors and actuators. The platform, which has been conceived to flexibly prototype such systems, demonstrates the feasibility of a wireless power supply and the use of a mu C circuit, for example for Lab-on-a-disk applications, thereby eliminating the need for cumbersome slip rings or batteries, and adding a cogent and new degree of freedom to the setup. The large number of sensors and actuators included demonstrate that a wide range of physical parameters can be easily monitored and altered. All devices are connected to the mu C via an (IC)-C-2 bus, therefore can be easily exchanged or augmented by other devices in order to perform a specific task on the disk. The wireless power supply takes up little additional physical space and should work in conjunction with most existing Lab-on-a-disk platforms as a straightforward add-on, since it does not require modification of the rotation axis and can be readily adapted to specific geometrical requirements.","298":"Additive manufacturing (AM) is poised to bring about a revolution in the way products are designed, manufactured, and distributed to end users. This technology has gained significant academic as well as industry interest due to its ability to create complex geometries with customizable material properties. AM has also inspired the development of the maker movement by democratizing design and manufacturing. Due to the rapid proliferation of a wide variety of technologies associated with AM, there is a lack of a comprehensive set of design principles, manufacturing guidelines, and standardization of best practices. These challenges are compounded by the fact that advancements in multiple technologies (for example materials processing, topology optimization) generate a \"positive feedback loop\" effect in advancing AM. In order to advance research interest and investment in AM technologies, some fundamental questions and trends about the dependencies existing in these avenues need highlighting. The goal of our review paper is to organize this body of knowledge surrounding AM, and present current barriers, findings, and future trends significantly to the researchers. We also discuss fundamental attributes of AM processes, evolution of the AM industry, and the affordances enabled by the emergence of AM in a variety of areas such as geometry processing, material design, and education. We conclude our paper by pointing out future directions such as the \"print-it-all\" paradigm, that have the potential to re-imagine current research and spawn completely new avenues for exploration.

They rely on wireless communication technologies, and they have provided many benefits to society, such as monitoring road traffic in real-time, giving continuous healthcare assistance to residents and managing the environment. This article revisits key interoperability questions in heterogeneous wireless networks for smart cities, and outlines a simple, modular architecture to deal with these complex issues. The architecture is composed by sensing, access network, Internet\/cloud and application layers. Different features provided by the architecture, such as interoperability among technologies, low cost, reliability and security, have been evaluated through experiments and simulations under different scenarios. The QoS support and the seamless connectivity between pairs of heterogeneous technologies are proposed through a policy-based management (PBM) framework and MIH (Media Independent Handover). Moreover, an 802.11 mesh backbone composed of different types of mesh routers has been deployed for interconnecting the sensors and actuators to the Internet. Key results from experiments in the backbone are examined. They compare: (i) the performance of a single-path routing protocol (OLSR) with a multipath one (MP-OLSR); (ii) the monitoring delays from the proposed low cost sunspot\/mesh and arduino\/mesh gateways; and (iii) the authentication mechanisms employed. Significant results from simulations allow the analysis of the reliability on vehicular\/mesh networks under jamming attacks by applying the OLSR and MP-OLSR routing protocols.

However, a number of challenges exist: ultra-high-bit-rate requirements from the transport of increased bandwidth radio streams for multiple antennas in future mobile networks, and low latency and jitter to meet delay requirements and the demands of joint processing. A new fronthaul functional division is proposed which can alleviate the most demanding bit-rate requirements by transport of baseband signals instead of sampled radio waveforms, and enable statistical multiplexing gains. Delay and synchronisation issues remain to be solved. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Typical broad-spectrum sources necessitate the use of mechanical filter switching, which introduces delays between acquisition of different fluorescence channels, impeding the interpretation and quantification of highly dynamic processes. Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs), however, allow modulation of excitation light in microseconds. Here we provide a step-by-step protocol to enable any scientist to build a research-grade LED illuminator for live cell microscopy, even without prior experience with electronics or optics. We quantify and compare components, discuss our design considerations, and demonstrate the performance of our LED illuminator by imaging axonal transport of herpes virus particles with high temporal resolution.","306":"Datacenter networks deal with a variety of workloads, ranging from latency-sensitive small flows to bandwidth-hungry large flows. Load balancing schemes based on flow hashing, e.g., ECMP, cause congestion when hash collisions occur and can perform poorly in asymmetric topologies. Recent proposals to load balance the network require centralized traffic engineering, multipath-aware transport, or expensive specialized hardware. We propose a mechanism that avoids these limitations by (i) pushing load-balancing functionality into the soft network edge (e.g., virtual switches) such that no changes are required in the transport layer, customer VMs, or networking hardware, and (ii) load balancing on fine-grained, near-uniform units of data (flowcells) that fit within end-host segment offload optimizations used to support fast networking speeds. We design and implement such a soft-edge load balancing scheme, called Presto, and evaluate it on a 10 Gbps physical testbed. We demonstrate the computational impact of packet reordering on receivers and propose a mechanism to handle reordering in the TCP receive offload functionality. Presto's performance closely tracks that of a single, non-blocking switch over many workloads and is adaptive to failures and topology asymmetry.","307":"Hammertoe is one of the most common foot deformities. Arthrodesis or arthroplasty of the proximal interphalangeal joint using temporary Kirschner wire fixation is the most widespread method of surgical stabilization. However, this type of fixation is associated with some potential complications that can be obviated if percutaneous fixation is avoided. The purpose of the present study was to prospectively collect clinical and radiographic outcomes of operative correction of hammertoe deformity using a permanently implanted 1-piece intramedullary device. A total of 29 patients with 60 painful, rigid hammertoes were prospectively enrolled, clinically and radiographically examined, operatively treated, then followed and re-examined. The outcomes were measured in terms of the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society lesser toe and visual analog pain scores. After >= 18 months of follow-up, the incidence of fusion with satisfactory radiographic alignment was 85% (51 of 60 toes). One toe (1.67%) developed early postoperative implant failure because of dislocation of the device, there were no cases of infection, and the mean American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society lesser toe score was 87.4 +\/- 1.3 and the mean visual analog scale pain score was 1.78 +\/- 0.94. Twenty-five patients (86.21%) stated that they had no symptoms in the involved toes after surgery, and 4 (13.8%) experienced occasional pain, 2 (6.9%) of whom reported limitations of recreational activities and 2 (6.9%) reported persistent swelling without activity limitations. All the patients stated that they would undergo the surgery again if they had the same preoperative condition. (C) 2015 by the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

We are now able to communicate and interact with our surrounding environment through the use of multiple tiny sensors, REID technologies or small wireless robots. This allows a set of new applications and usages to be envisioned ranging from logistic and traceability purposes to emergency and rescue operations going through the monitoring of volcanos or forest fires. However, all this comes with several technical and scientific issues like how to ensure the reliability of wireless communications in disturbed environments, how to manage efficiently the low resources (energy, memory, etc.) or how to set a safe and sustainable (both hardware and software) platform maintenance. All these issues are addressed by researchers all around the world but solutions designed for IoT need to face real experimentations to be validated. To ease such experimentations for IoT, several experimental testbeds have been deployed offering diverse and heterogeneous services and tools. In this article, we study the different requirements and features such facilities should offer. We survey the different experimental facilities currently available for the community, describe their characteristics. In particular, we detail the different hardware used for sensor networks and robot platforms and the scope of services the different facilities offer with a specific focus on testbeds which enable experimentations with mobility. We expect this survey assist a potential user to easily choose the one to use regarding his own needs.

Despite their great potential impact on agricultural research, few contributions have dealt with the development of automatic control systems for wind tunnels in the field of greenhouse technology. The objective of this paper is to present an automatic control system that provides precision and speed of measurement, as well as efficient data processing in low-speed wind tunnel experiments for greenhouse engineering applications. The system is based on an algorithm that identifies the system model and calculates the optimum PI controller. The validation of the system was performed on a cellulose evaporative cooling pad and on insect-proof screens to assess its response to perturbations. The control system provided an accuracy of <0.06 ms(-1) for airflow speed and <0.50 Pa for pressure drop, thus permitting the reproducibility and standardization of the tests. The proposed control system also incorporates a fully-integrated software unit that manages the tests in terms of airflow speed and pressure drop set points.","311":"The relationship between cultural heritage domain and new technologies has always been complex, dialectical and often inspired by the human desire to induce these spaces not created for that purpose, to pursue technological trends, eventually offering to the end-users devices and innovative technologies that could become a ` dead weight' during their cultural experiences. However, by means of innovative technological applications and location-based services it is possible to shorten the distance between cultural spaces and their visitors, nowadays determined by the purely aesthetic and essentially passive fruition of cultural objects. This paper presents the design and implementation of a novel multipurpose system for creating single smart spaces (S-3), a new concept of intelligent environment, that relies on innovative sensors board named smart crickets and an ad hoc proximity strategy; by following the Internet of Things paradigm the proposed system is able to transform a cultural space in a smart cultural environment to enhance the enjoyment and satisfaction of the involved people. To assess the effectiveness of our solution, we have experienced two real case studies, the first one situated within an art exhibition (indoor), and the second one concerning an historical building (outdoor). In this way, technology can become a mediator between visitors and fruition, an instrument of connection between people, objects and spaces to create new social, economic and cultural opportunities.","312":"Structural strain under external environmental loads is one of the main monitoring parameters in structural health monitoring or dynamic tests.

Measurement results confirm the sensor's functionality regarding its static and dynamic characterization. Furthermore, in order to verify the functionality of the designed wireless strain sensor for dynamic strain monitoring, a cluster-star network evaluation system is developed for strain modal testing on an experimental steel truss structure. Test results show very good agreement with the finite element (FE) simulations. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed WSSN for large structural dynamic strain monitoring.","313":"Pelvic fractures are uncommon but complex injuries associated with a high degree of morbidity and mortality. Most fractures involving the pelvis, specifically the sacrum, can be effectively stabilized with iliosacral screws alone. However, significantly unstable fractures, particularly vertical shear patterns, as well as U-type variant sacral fracture patterns that create spinopelvic instability, require the addition of lumbopelvic fixation. The surgical technique involves neurologic decompression as necessary, multiplanar reduction of the pelvic ring and sacrum, and placement of stable fixation. Treatment of these severe injuries requiring lumbopelvic fixation is challenging and requires active collaboration between spine trauma and pelvis trauma surgeons. Although not routinely used, lumbopelvic fixation is an essential technique for the stabilization of complex pelvis fractures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Methods for allowing the production of grain and protein based products which are shape stable throughout the cooking process allow for increase shape fidelity. Data driven recipes allow for customized flavor and nutrition, and printing processes allow for the production of unique textures and meso-scale porosity. Together these advances represent important steps to developing novel utility in 3D food printing.","315":"This paper is based on the experience of introducing wireless sensor networks (WSNs) into the building industry in Denmark and in a rural area of Greenland. There are very real advantages in the application of the technology and its consequences for the life cycle operation of the building sector. Sensor networks can be seen as an important part of the Internet of Things and may even constitute an Internet of Sensors, since the communication layers can differ from the Internet standards. The current paper describes the case for application, followed by a discussion of the observed adaptive advantages and consequences of the technology. Essentially, WSNs constitute a highly sophisticated technology that is more robust in a rural context due to its extremely simple installation procedures (plug and play) allowing the use of local less- skilled labour, and the possibility of reconfiguring and repurposing its use remotely.","316":"In this paper, we present Virtual Touch, a toolkit that allows the development of educational activities through a mixed reality environment such that, using various tangible elements, the interconnection of a virtual world with the real world is enabled. The main goal of Virtual Touch is to facilitate the installation, configuration and programming of different types of technologies, abstracting the creator of educational applications from the technical details involving the use of tangible interfaces and virtual worlds. Therefore, it is specially designed to enable teachers to themselves create educational activities for their students in a simple way, taking into account that teachers generally lack advanced knowledge in computer programming and electronics.

Through our analysis, we make several contributions. First, we provide a general overview of the structure and common framings within research on makers. We discuss how these statements reconfigure themes of empowerment and progress that have been central to HCI rhetoric since the field's inception. In the latter part of the article, we discuss the consequences of these shifts for contemporary research problems. In particular, we explore the problem of designed obsolescence, a core issue for Sustainable Interaction Design (SID) research. We show how the framing of the maker, as an empowered subject, presents certain opportunities and limitations for this research discourse. Finally, we offer alternative framings of empowerment that can expand maker discourse and its use in contemporary research problems such as SID.","318":"In technoscientific conditions what counts as knowledge creation is not primarily the individual experimental achievement that gives coherence to scientific practice and separates science from its publics; rather, it is a form of dispersed experimentation in more than human worlds: distributed invention power. Distributed invention power is organised and regulated through the pervasive securitisation of technoscience: surveillance and control of technoscientific fields as well as financialisation of its activities and research outputs. The securitisation of science reorders the traditional split between the public sphere, the private sector and the commons. The folding of each one of these spheres into the other underlies a constant, often antagonistic, oscillation between big science and open science. What is constitutive of the diverse movements that sustain open technoscience is not that they challenge technoscience as such but that they experiment with technoscience to create alternative forms of life.","319":"Over the last few years, depth cameras have become increasingly popular for a range of applications, including human-computer interaction and gaming, augmented reality, machine vision, and medical imaging. Many of the commercially-available devices use the time-of-flight principle, where active illumination is temporally coded and analyzed in the camera to estimate a per-pixel depth map of the scene. In this paper, we propose a fundamentally new imaging modality for all time-of-flight (ToF) cameras: per-pixel radial velocity measurement. The proposed technique exploits the Doppler effect of objects in motion, which shifts the temporal illumination frequency before it reaches the camera. Using carefully coded illumination and modulation frequencies of the ToF camera, object velocities directly map to measured pixel intensities. We show that a slight modification of our imaging system allows for color, depth, and velocity information to be captured simultaneously. Combining the optical flow computed on the RGB frames with the measured metric radial velocity allows us to further estimate the full 3D metric velocity field of the scene. The proposed technique has applications in many computer graphics and vision problems, for example motion tracking, segmentation, recognition, and motion deblurring.","320":"5-6 MHz PMNT\/epoxy 1-3 composites were prepared by a modified dice-and-fill method. They exhibit excellent properties for ultrasonic transducer applications, such as ultrahigh thickness electromechanical coupling coefficient k(t) (85.7%), large piezoelectric coefficient d(33) (1209 pC\/N), and relatively low acoustic impedance Z (1.82 x 10(7) kg\/(m(2)s)). Besides, two types of Time-of-Flight Diffraction (TOFD) ultrasonic transducers have been designed, fabricated, and characterized, which have different matching layer schemes with the acoustic impedance of 4.8 and 5.7 x 10(6) kg\/(m(2)s), respectively. In the detection on a backwall of 12.7 mm polystyrene, the former exhibits higher detectivity, the relative pulse-echo sensitivity and -6 dB relative bandwidth are -21.93 dB and 102.7%, respectively, while the later exhibits broader bandwidth, the relative pulse-echo sensitivity and -6 dB relative bandwidth are -24.08 dB and 117.3%, respectively. These TOFD ultrasonic transducers based on PMNT\/epoxy 1-3 composite exhibit considerably improved performance over the commercial PZT\/epoxy 1-3 composite TOFD ultrasonic transducer.","321":"This paper proposes a dynamic image-based visual servoing (IBVS) control law for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a single fixed on-board camera facing downward. The motion control problem is to regulate the relative lateral position of the vehicle to a stationary target located on the ground. The control law is termed dynamic as it is based on the dynamics and kinematics of the vehicle. The proposed design uses a nonlinear input-dependent change of state coordinates and its error dynamics are proven to be locally exponentially stable with an estimate provided for the region of attraction. Experimental and simulation results demonstrate the method's ease of on-board implementation, performance, and robustness. The simulation and experimental results include a comparison with an established dynamic IBVS method. This comparison shows the proposed method can provide similar performance with the benefit of reduced complexity.","322":"This paper describes an experience, held with a class of primary school children, aimed to introduce a novel educational topic, the smart materials, and the interfaces built with them (Smart Material Interfaces).

Particularly in medium-sized and large areas they require a lot of time and intensive labour which directly translates into an increase in the measurement cost. Introduction of an automated system would increase efficiency of the measurements, and therefore could present both practical and scientific benefit. The paper presents initial feasibility study for designing a system that permits the measurement of selected acoustic parameters for any choice of three-dimensional grid of measurement points throughout the volume of the room. The system will utilize an autonomous probe attached to a blimp, and will be able to measure and analyze acoustic characteristics of the rooms.

In particular, Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) many-core architectures have been adopted for multimedia and signal processing applications with massive amounts of data parallelism where both performance and flexible programmability are important metrics. However, this class of processors has faced many challenges due to its increasing fabrication cost and design complexity. Moreover, the increasing gap between design productivity and chip complexity requires new design methods. Nowadays, the recent evolution of silicon integration technology, on the one hand, and the wide usage of reusable Intellectual Property (IP) cores and FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays), on the other hand, are attractive solutions to meet these challenges and reduce the time-to-market. The objective of this work is to study the performances of massively parallel SIMD on-chip architectures with current design methodologies based on recent integration technologies. Flexibility offered by these new design tools allows design space exploration to search for the most effective implementations. This work introduces an IP-based design methodology for easy building configurable and flexible massively parallel SIMD processing on FPGA platforms. The proposed approach allows implementing a generic parallel architecture based on IP assembly that can be tailored in order to better satisfy the requirements of highly-demanding applications.

Biological responses depend on tissue temperature; target tissue temperature needs to be precisely measured and controlled to achieve desired thermal effects. In this work, a unique photoacoustic (PA) sensor is proposed for temperature measurement during interstitial laser phototherapy. A continuous-wave laser light and a pulsed laser light, for photothermal irradiation and photoacoustic temperature measurement, respectively, were delivered to the target tissue through a fiber coupler. During laser irradiation, the PA amplitude was measured. The Gruneisen parameter and the bioheat equation were used to determine the temperature in strategic positions in the target tissue. Our results demonstrate that the interstitial PA amplitude is a linear function of temperature in the range of 22 to 55 degrees C, as confirmed by thermocouple measurement. Furthermore, by choosing appropriate laser parameters, the maximum temperature surrounding the active diffuse fiber tip in tissue can be controlled in the range of 41 to 55 degrees C. Thus, this sensor could potentially be used for fast, accurate, and convenient three-dimensional temperature measurement, and for real-time feedback and control of interstitial laser phototherapy in cancer treatment.","327":"The direction of sunshine or the installation sites of environmental control facilities in the greenhouse result in different temperature and humidity levels in the various zones of the greenhouse, and thus, the production quality of crop is inconsistent. This study proposed a wireless-networked decentralized fuzzy control scheme to regulate the environmental parameters of various culture zones within a greenhouse. The proposed scheme can create different environmental conditions for cultivating different crops in various zones and achieve diversification or standardization of crop production. A star-type wireless sensor network is utilized to communicate with each sensing node, actuator node, and control node in various zones within the greenhouse. The fuzzy rule-based inference system is used to regulate the environmental parameters for temperature and humidity based on real-time data of plant growth response provided by a growth stage selector. The growth stage selector defines the control ranges of temperature and humidity of the various culture zones according to the leaf area of the plant, the number of leaves, and the cumulative amount of light. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme is stable and robust and provides basis for future greenhouse applications.","328":"This paper presents a hand gestural interaction system that is used to handle a Desktop Haptic Strip for Shape Rendering (DHSSR). The strip is a physical display of virtual curves intersecting 3D virtual objects, and aims at allowing designers to evaluate the quality of shapes during the conceptual design phase of new products. The DHSSR consists of a servo-actuated developable metallic strip, which reproduces cross-sectional curves of 3D virtual objects. In order to generate the virtual curve intersecting the virtual object it has been implemented a hand gestural interaction system, which allows moving the curve or the 3D object. Specifically, through an interaction approach based on a magnetic pinch the user can move the virtual strip until reaching the desired position. Instead, an interaction modality based on index finger recognition allows moving the 3D object while the virtual curve is floating in space. The virtual curve generated by the interaction is used for deforming the physical strip. The hand gestural interaction system has been implemented by using low cost and open technologies, and combines an engine for interactive 3D content generation (Unity 3D), a motion capture sensor (LeapMotion) and the Arduino Leonardo board. In particular, the user's hands are tracked by means of the Leap Motion sensor. The Unity 3D environment is used to virtually render the virtual objects (curve and shape) and the virtual avatar of the users' hands. The virtual environment is connected with the Arduino Leonardo board in order to control the six servo-actuators of the DHSSR. The paper also presents some studies performed to evaluate the performances of the DHSSR system and the usability of the hand gestural interaction modalities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A periodic micro-scanning movement of only a few degrees enables the vibrating compound eye to locate contrasting objects with a 40-fold greater resolution than that imposed by the interommatidial angle. In this study, we developed a new algorithm merging the output of 35 local processing units consisting of adjacent pairs of artificial ommatidia. The local measurements performed by each pair are processed in parallel with very few computational resources, which makes it possible to reach a high refresh rate of 500 Hz. An aerial robotic platform with two degrees of freedom equipped with the active CurvACE placed over naturally textured panels was able to assess its linear position accurately with respect to the environment thanks to its efficient gaze stabilization system. The algorithm was found to perform robustly at different light conditions as well as distance variations relative to the ground and featured small closed-loop positioning errors of the robot in the range of 45 mm. In addition, three tasks of interest were performed without having to change the algorithm: short-range odometry, visual stabilization, and tracking contrasting objects (hands) moving over a textured background.","330":"Microorganisms act both as drivers and indicators of perturbations in the marine environment. In an effort to establish baselines to predict the response of marine habitats to environmental change, here we report a broad survey of microbial diversity across the Indian Ocean, including the first microbial samples collected in the pristine lagoon of Salomon Islands, Chagos Archipelago. This was the first largescale ecogenomic survey aboard a private yacht employing a 'citizen oceanography' approach and tools and protocols easily adapted to ocean going sailboats. Our data highlighted biogeographic patterns in microbial community composition across the Indian Ocean. Samples from within the Salomon Islands lagoon contained a community which was different even from adjacent samples despite constant water exchange, driven by the dominance of the photosynthetic cyanobacterium Synechococcus. In the lagoon, Synechococcus was also responsible for driving shifts in the metatranscriptional profiles. Enrichment of transcripts related to photosynthesis and nutrient cycling indicated bottom-up controls of community structure. However a five-fold increase in viral transcripts within the lagoon during the day, suggested a concomitant top-down control by bacteriophages. Indeed, genome recruitment against Synechococcus reference genomes suggested a role of viruses in providing the ecological filter for determining the beta-diversity patterns in this system.","331":"The role of social innovations in transforming the lives of individuals and communities has been a source of popular attention in recent years. This article systematically reviews the available evidence of the relationship between social innovation and its promotion of health equity. Guided by Fair Foundations: The VicHealth framework for health equity and examining four types of social innovation-social movements, service-related social innovations, social enterprise and digital social innovations-we find a growing literature on social innovation activities, but inconsistent evaluative evidence of their impacts on health equities, particularly at the socio-economic, political and cultural level of the framework. Distinctive characteristics of social innovations related to the promotion of health equity include the mobilization of latent or unrealised value through new combinations of (social, cultural and material) resources; growing bridging social capital and purposeful approaches to linking individual knowledge and experience to institutional change. These have implications for health promotion practice and for research about social innovation and health equity.","332":"This paper introduces a novel algorithm to obtain attitude estimations from low cost inertial measurement units including 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis magnetometer. This nonlinear attitude estimator is derived from Lyapunov's theory and formulated in the special orthogonal group SO(3). The impact of the gyroscope bias is also assessed and an online estimator provided. The performance of the proposed estimator is validated and compared to current commonly used methods, namely the classical extended Kalman filter and two other nonlinear estimators in SO(3). Realistic simulations consider a quadcopter unmanned aerial vehicle subject to wind disturbances and whose sensors parameters have been identified from flight tests data.","333":"The dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT) facilitates high-affinity presynaptic DA reuptake that temporally and spatially constrains DA neurotransmission. Aberrant DAT function is implicated in attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder. DAT is a major psychostimulant target, and psychostimulant reward strictly requires binding to DAT. DAT function is acutely modulated by dynamic membrane trafficking at the presynaptic terminal and a PKC-sensitive negative endocytic mechanism, or \"endocytic brake,\" controls DAT plasma membrane stability. However, the molecular basis for the DAT endocytic brake is unknown, and it is unknown whether this braking mechanism is unique to DAT or common to monoamine transporters. Here, we report that the cdc42-activated, nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, Ack1, is a DAT endocytic brake that stabilizes DAT at the plasma membrane and is released in response to PKC activation. Pharmacologic and shRNA-mediated Ack1 silencing enhanced basal DAT internalization and blocked PKC-stimulated DAT internalization, but had no effects on SERT endocytosis. Both cdc42 activation and PKC stimulation converge on Ack1 to control Ack1 activity and DAT endocytic capacity, and Ack1 inactivation is required for stimulated DAT internalization downstream of PKC activation. Moreover, constitutive Ack1 activation is sufficient to rescue the gain-of-function endocytic phenotype exhibited by the ADHD DAT coding variant, R615C. These findings reveal a unique endocytic control switch that is highly specific for DAT. Moreover, the ability to rescue the DAT(R615C) coding variant suggests that manipulating DAT trafficking mechanisms may be a potential therapeutic approach to correct DAT coding variants that exhibit trafficking dysregulation.","334":"The authors model the user innovation networks of NASA's International Space Apps Challenges and use social network analysis to empirically investigate the existence and impact of three drivers of innovation.

On the one hand it considers the external approach, that is, the analysis of visible signals linked to the emerging issues that in an early stage are called \"weak signals\". On the other hand, it tries to study emerging issues taking into account their internal motivations. In this case the aim is to value the social, economic or other kind of reasons that are hidden under emerging issues. A post-structuralism perspective (CIA, causal layered analysis) is used to address this objective.","This double approach allows to consider emerging issues in a holistic way, taking into account what is visible and what is not so apparent.

With an increase in the deployment of smart objects, IoT is expected to have a significant impact on human life in the near future. A major breakthrough in bridging the gap between virtual and physical worlds came from the vision of the Web of Things (WoT), which employs open Web standards in achieving information sharing and objects interoperability. Social Web of Things (SWoT) further extends WoT to integrate smart objects with social networks and is observed to not only bridge between physical and virtual worlds but also facilitate continued interaction between physical devices and human.

While technology exists today for engineering distributed, real-time component-based applications, many problems remain unsolved by existing tools. Model-driven development techniques are powerful, but there are very few existing and complete tool chains that offer an end-to-end solution to developers, from design to deployment. There is a need for an integrated model-driven development environment that addresses all phases of application lifecycle including design, development, verification, analysis, integration, deployment, operation and maintenance, with supporting automation in every phase. Arguably, a centerpiece of such a model-driven environment is the modeling language. To that end, this paper presents a wide-spectrum architecture design language called DREMS ML that itself is an integrated collection of individual domain-specific sub-languages. We claim that the language promotes \"correct-by-construction\" software development and integration by supporting each individual phase of the application lifecycle. Using a case study, we demonstrate how the design of DREMS ML impacts the development of embedded systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This analysis shows that the required technologies have already been developed, but not for a use in the mass market, where low cost is mandatory to be successful. Central roles for this success will be played by governments, industries, and research and standardization institutions. A great effort in both national and international synchronization and coordination activities, together with a clear regulatory push, will be mandatory. Enabling technologies for the plug-in hybrid and full electric vehicles will also come from the \"3Cs\": Costs, Comfort, and Climatic dependency.

The photodiode pixel array can not only capture images but also harvest solar energy. As such, the CMOS image sensor chip is able to switch between imaging and harvesting modes towards self-power operation. Moreover, an on-chip maximum power point tracking (MPPT)-based power management system (PMS) is designed for the dual-mode image sensor to further improve the energy efficiency. A new isolated P-well energy harvesting and imaging (EHI) pixel with very high fill factor is introduced. Several ultra-low power design techniques such as reset and select boosting techniques have been utilized to maintain a wide pixel dynamic range. The chip was designed and fabricated in a 1.8 V, 1P6M 0.18 mu m CMOS process. Total power consumption of the imager is 6.53 mu W for a 96 x 96 pixel array with 1 V supply and 5 fps frame rate. Up to 30 W of power could be generated by the new EHI pixels. The PMS is capable of providing 3x the power required during imaging mode with 50% efficiency allowing energy autonomous operation with a 72.5% duty cycle.","340":"Harnessing the full power of the paradigm-shifting cognitive radio ad hoc networks (CRAHNs) hinges on solving the problem of time synchronization between the radios on the different stages of the cognitive radio cycle. The dynamic network topology, the temporal and spatial variations in spectrum availability, and the distributed multi-hop architecture of CRAHNs mandate novel solutions to achieve time synchronization and efficiently support spectrum sensing, access, decision and mobility. In this article, we advance this research agenda by proposing the novel Bio-inspired time SynChronization protocol for CRAHNs (BSynC). The protocol draws on the spontaneous firefly synchronization observed in parts of Southeast Asia. The significance of BSynC lies in its capability of promoting symmetric time synchronization between pairs of network nodes independent of the network topology or a predefined sequence for synchronization. It enables the nodes in CRAHNs to efficiently synchronize in a decentralized manner, and it is also reliable to changes, faults and attacks. The findings suggest that BSynC improves convergence time, thereby favoring deployment in dynamic network scenarios. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

An Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) is employed to find the optimal placement of sensor nodes in the Region of Interest (RoI). Data quality issues are introduced to simulate their impact on the performance of the ESN. Spatial Regression Test (SRT) is also utilised to promote robustness in data quality of the designed ESN. The proposed method provides high network representativeness (fit for purpose) with minimum sensor redundancy (cost), and ensures robustness by enabling the network to continue to achieve its objectives when some sensors fail.","342":"Accurate localization of mobile nodes has been an important and fundamental problem in underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs). The detection information returned from a mobile node is meaningful only if its location is known. In this paper, we propose two localization algorithms based on color filtering technology called PCFL and ACFL. PCFL and ACFL aim at collaboratively accomplishing accurate localization of underwater mobile nodes with minimum energy expenditure. They both adopt the overlapping signal region of task anchors which can communicate with the mobile node directly as the current sampling area. PCFL employs the projected distances between each of the task projections and the mobile node, while ACFL adopts the direct distance between each of the task anchors and the mobile node. The proportion factor of distance is also proposed to weight the RGB values. By comparing the nearness degrees of the RGB sequences between the samples and the mobile node, samples can be filtered out. The normalized nearness degrees are considered as the weighted standards to calculate the coordinates of the mobile nodes. The simulation results show that the proposed methods have excellent localization performance and can localize the mobile node in a timely way. The average localization error of PCFL is decreased by about 30.4% compared to the AFLA method.","343":"Distributed transmission rate tuning is important for a wide variety of IEEE 802.15.4 network applications such as industrial network control systems. Such systems often require each node to sustain certain throughput demand in order to guarantee the system performance. It is thus essential to determine a proper transmission rate that can meet the application requirement and compensate for network imperfections (e.g., packet loss). Such a tuning in a heterogeneous network is difficult due to the lack of modeling techniques that can deal with the heterogeneity of the network as well as the network traffic changes. In this paper, a distributed transmission rate tuning algorithm in a heterogeneous IEEE 802.15.4 CSMA\/CA network is proposed. Each node uses the results of clear channel assessment (CCA) to estimate the busy channel probability. Then a mathematical framework is developed to estimate the on-going heterogeneous traffics using the busy channel probability at runtime. Finally a distributed algorithm is derived to tune the transmission rate of each node to accurately meet the throughput requirement. The algorithm does not require modifications on IEEE 802.15.4 MAC layer and it has been experimentally implemented and extensively tested using TelosB nodes with the TinyOS protocol stack. The results reveal that the algorithm is accurate and can satisfy the throughput demand. Compared with existing techniques, the algorithm is fully distributed and thus does not require any central coordination. With this property, it is able to adapt to traffic changes and re-adjust the transmission rate to the desired level, which cannot be achieved using the traditional modeling techniques.","344":"We aim at developing autonomous miniature hovering flying robots capable of navigating in unstructured GPS-denied environments.

As detection element, an active poly(vinyl chloride)based membrane was used, doped with cetyltrimethylammonium dodecylsulphate (CTA(+)-DS-). The experimental measures of emf indicate Nernstian behaviour with the CTA(+) content of test solutions, as it was described in the literature, proving the validity of the developed prototype. A comparative analysis of performance was made by using the same chemical detector but changing the measurement instrumentation.

It is autonomous (runs off the bike battery), replicable (open source and open hardware), scalable (different fleet sizes) and modular (sensors can be added), so it can be used for further research and development. The system monitors location (global positioning system), rider control data (level of assistance) and other custom sensor input in real time. The SEMS data feeds an online interface for data analysis, for riders to view their own data and for sharing on social media. The basic system can be replicated by other researchers and can be extended with modules to explore various issues in e-bike research. The source code and hardware design are publicly available, under the General Public License, for non-commercial use. SEMS was implemented on 30 bikes and collected data during 10 months of real-word trials in the UK. This study details the design and implementation of the hardware and software, discusses the system use and explores features for future design iterations. The SEMS turns singular e-bikes into a networked fleet and is an example of the internet of things in the cycling context.","367":"The smart e-bike monitoring system (SEMS) is a platform for the real-time acquisition of usage data from electrically-assisted bikes (also called pedelecs or e-bikes).

Such firm strategies are now common for open source software and other information goods. However, they pose conceptual and practical uncertainties for hardware-focused companies, particularly as research on open hardware has emphasized community rather than firm success. Here we study firm openness in 3D printing, with a case study of how MakerBot Industries leveraged external communities and selective openness become the consumer market leader. After reviewing the literature on systemic innovation and selective openness, we document the proprietary strategies of a dozen startup companies during the first two decades of the 3D printing industry. We contrast this to the open hardware, software and content strategy that MakerBot's founders used to enter and grow the consumer market from 2009 onward. We show how MakerBot shifted to a selectively open, systemic innovation strategy that complemented proprietary hardware and software with open user-generated content from its Thingiverse online community. From this, we suggest the inherent complementarity of selective openness strategies between open and proprietary components, and conclude with predictions as to when and how a startup or incumbent firm will combine open and proprietary elements.

Indeed, most of the existing commercial architectures are closed and provide little flexibility. In this paper, an open hardware architecture for designing a modular wireless sensor node for health monitoring is proposed. By separating the connection and sensing functions in two separate boards, compliant with the IEEE1451 standard, we add plug and play capabilities to analog transducers, while granting at the same time a high level of customization. As an additional contribution of the work, we developed a cosimulation tool which simplifies the physical connection with the hardware devices and provides support for complex systems. Finally, a wireless body area network for fall detection and health monitoring, based on wireless node prototypes realized according to the proposed architecture, is presented as an application scenario.","379":"Health monitoring is nowadays one of the hottest markets due to the increasing interest in prevention and treatment of physical problems.

While these plates have a good track record, they can become symptomatic and require removal once the fracture has healed. Open hardware removal is associated with a number of additional risks to the patient, including infection, scarring, nerve damage, and blood loss. In addition, the recovery time after open hardware removal may be prolonged, thereby predisposing the patient to postoperative stiffness. The purpose of this article is to describe a technique for removing proximal humerus locking plates arthroscopically. Although technically demanding, the benefits of this technique include smaller incisions, quicker recovery time, decreased risk of infection, and reduced blood loss. Arthroscopy also provides the surgeon with the ability to address concomitant intra-articular pathology at the time of surgery. Additionally, we use a bone-void filler to reduce the risk of fracture through stress caused by previous screw holes.","391":"Environmental data are critical to understanding environmental phenomena, yet their consistent collection and curation can be cost-prohibitive.

Each example develops differently the relationships between means and ends in relation to authority and legitimacy.

With the emergence and rapid development of sensor technologies, citizens potentially have more powerful tools to collect data and generate information to understand their living environment. Although sensor technologies are developing fast, citizen sensing has not been widely implemented yet and published studies are only a few. In this paper, we analyse the practical experiences from an implementation of citizen sensing for urban environment monitoring. A bottom-up model in which citizens develop and use sensors for environmental monitoring is described and assessed. The paper focuses on a case study of Amsterdam Smart Citizens Lab using NO2 sensors for air quality monitoring. We found that the bottom-up citizen sensing is still challenging but can be successful with open cooperation and effective use of online and offline facilities. Based on the assessment, suggestions are proposed for further implementations and research.","400":"Citizen science is increasingly being used in diverse research domains.

One parameter to assess the water transparency is the diffuse attenuation coefficient. However, the number of subsurface irradiance measurements obtained with conventional instrumentation is relatively low, due to instrument costs and the logistic requirements to provide regular and autonomous observations. In recent years, the citizen science concept has increased the number of environmental observations, both in time and space. The recent technological advances in embedded systems and sensors also enable volunteers (citizens) to create their own devices (known as Do-It-Yourself or DIY technologies). In this paper, a DIY instrument to measure irradiance at different depths and automatically calculate the diffuse attenuation K-d coefficient is presented. The instrument, named KdUINO, is based on an encapsulated low-cost photonic sensor and Arduino (an open-hardware platform for the data acquisition). The whole instrument has been successfully operated and the data validated comparing the KdUINO measurements with the commercial instruments. Workshops have been organized with high school students to validate its feasibility.","404":"The combination of open-source software and hardware provides technically feasible methods to create low-cost, highly customized scientific research equipment.

Recent advances in open-source software and hardware technologies, such as the Arduino project, show potential for the development of low-cost (similar to$100) automated dataloggers required for continuous data collection. We developed an Arduino-based datalogger (the Ecohydro Logger) coupled with water sensors providing digital output to establish a hydrologic monitoring network in the data-scarce wet-dry tropics of Guanacaste, Costa Rica. While we experienced some challenges with a first iteration of our Arduinobased datalogger, an improved version was robust and able to capture long periods of high-frequency stream discharge data. Integration of the monitoring program into the local community was also key to successful deployment, allowing exchange of local knowledge and support.

The widespread availability of open-source hardware together with novel analytical methods based on pulsed flows have opened the possibility of implementing standalone automated analytical systems at low cost. Among the areas that can benefit from this approach are the analysis of industrial products and effluents and environmental analysis. In this work, a multi-pumping flow system is proposed for the determination of phosphorus in effluents and polluted water samples. The system employs photometric detection based on the formation of molybdovanadophosphoric acid, and the fluidic circuit is built using three solenoid micropumps. The detection is implemented with a low cost LED-photodiode photometric detection system and the whole system is controlled by an open-source Arduino Uno microcontroller board. The optimization of the timing to ensure the color development and the pumping cycle is discussed for the proposed implementation. Experimental results to evaluate the system behavior are presented verifying a linear relationship between the relative absorbance and the phosphorus concentrations for levels as high as 50 mg L-1.","429":"The widespread diffusion of sensors, mobile devices, social media and open data are reconfiguring the way data underpinning policy and science are being produced and consumed.

There can be major benefits from the deployment of the IoT in smart cities and environmental monitoring, but to realize such benefits, and reduce potential risks, there is an urgent need to address current limitations, including the interoperability of sensors, data quality, security of access and new methods for spatio-temporal analysis. Within this context, the manuscript provides an overview of the AirSensEUR project, which establishes an affordable open software\/hardware multi-sensor platform, which is nonetheless able to monitor air pollution at low concentration levels. AirSensEUR is described from the perspective of interoperable data management with emphasis on possible use case scenarios, where reliable and timely air quality data would be essential.","433":"In this chapter we will show how modern FPGA offers the possibility of implementing Reconfigurable Virtual Instrumentation, a new kind of electronic instrumentation which generates interesting opportunities for regular users but that also poses several technical challenges for advanced users and instrument developers. We will analyze some of the main problems and we will give some ideas and possible strategies to deal with them. In order to put the subject in the right context we will review some general concepts regarding instrumentation in general and we later proceed with some more specific concepts and definitions. The chapter also describes two hardware\/software platforms for science and high-education developed at the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) where the concept of RVI proposed in this chapter was applied. Although we mainly adopt a scientist's prospective to define and analyze instrumentation, most of the conclusions drawn along this chapter can be easily generalized for a wide range of applications in commercial or industrial sectors.","434":"In this chapter we will show how modern FPGA offers the possibility of implementing Reconfigurable Virtual Instrumentation, a new kind of electronic instrumentation which generates interesting opportunities for regular users but that also poses several technical challenges for advanced users and instrument developers.

Involving and empowering citizens as active managers of their health represents a desirable shift from the current culture mainly focused on treatment of disease, to one also focused on continuous health management and well-being. Current developments in technological areas such as the Internet of Things (IoT), lead to new technological solutions that can aid this shift in the healthcare sector. This study presents the design, development, implementation and evaluation of a platform called Common Recognition and Identification Platform (CRIP), a part of the CareStore project, which aims at supporting caregivers and citizens to manage health routines in a seamless way. Specifically, the CRIP offers sensor-based support for seamless identification of users and health devices. A set of initial requirements was defined with a focus on usability limitations and current sensor technologies. The CRIP was designed and implemented using several technologies that enable seamless integration and interaction of sensors and people, namely Near Field Communication and fingerprint biometrics for identification and authentication, Bluetooth for communication with health devices and web services for wider integration with other platforms. Two CRIP prototypes were implemented and evaluated in laboratory during a period of eight months. The evaluations consisted of identifying users and devices, as well as seamlessly configure and acquire vital data from the last. Also, the entire Carestore platform was deployed in a nursing home where its usability was evaluated with caregivers. The evaluations helped assess that seamless identification of users and seamless configuration and communication with health devices is feasible and can help enable the IoT on healthcare applications. Therefore, the CRIP and similar platforms could be transformed into a valuable enabling technology for secure and reliable IoT deployments on the healthcare sector.","438":"Population aging and increasing pressure on health systems are two issues that demand solutions.

In order to improve MEMS performance, it is proposed to fuse MEMS-IMU information with optical flow, and correct MEMS attitude when it is diverged. Then, image coordinate of optical flow is proposed to be firstly transformed to body one for better vehicle attitude calculation. The Allan variances of MEMS sensors are used in KF filter to replace the regular white noise. The algorithm is finally testified by simulation results, which is shown that vehicle attitude modified by combining with optical flow is of good performance, with smaller error, slow divergence and better robustness.

Their adoption and use are expected to be more and more pervasive, making them important components of the Future Internet. A novel paradigm where Cloud and loT are merged together is foreseen as disruptive and as an enabler of a large number of application scenarios. In this paper, we focus our attention on the integration of Cloud and IoT, which is what we call the CloudloT paradigm. Many works in literature have surveyed Cloud and IoT separately and, more precisely, their main properties, features, underlying technologies, and open issues. However, to the best of our knowledge, these works lack a detailed analysis of the new CloudloT paradigm, which involves completely new applications, challenges, and research issues. To bridge this gap, in this paper we provide a literature survey on the integration of Cloud and IoT. Starting by analyzing the basics of both IoT and Cloud Computing, we discuss their complementarity, detailing what is currently driving to their integration. Thanks to the adoption of the CloudloT paradigm a number of applications are gaining momentum: we provide an up-to-date picture of CloudloT applications in literature, with a focus on their specific research challenges. These challenges are then analyzed in details to show where the main body of research is currently heading. We also discuss what is already available in terms of platforms - both proprietary and open source - and projects implementing the CloudloT paradigm. Finally, we identify open issues and future directions in this field, which we expect to play a leading role in the landscape of the Future Internet. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, the tools used to program them require detailed manipulation and understanding of low-level knitting operations. We present a compiler that can automatically turn assemblies of high-level shape primitives (tubes, sheets) into low-level machine instructions. These high-level shape primitives allow knit objects to be scheduled, scaled, and otherwise shaped in ways that require thousands of edits to low-level instructions. At the core of our compiler is a heuristic transfer planning algorithm for knit cycles, which we prove is both sound and complete. This algorithm enables the translation of high-level shaping and scheduling operations into needle-level operations. We show a wide range of examples produced with our compiler and demonstrate a basic visual design interface that uses our compiler as a backend.","479":"Industrial knitting machines can produce finely detailed, seamless, 3D surfaces quickly and without human intervention.

These systems consist of a variety of different components\/sensors and many processes like clustering, routing, security, and self-organization. Routing is necessary for medical-based WSNs because it allows remote data delivery and it facilitates network scalability in large hospitals. However, routing entails several problems, mainly due to the open nature of wireless networks, and these need to be addressed. This paper looks at two of the problems that arise due to wireless routing between the nodes and access points of a medical WSN (for IoT use): black hole and selective forwarding (SF) attacks. A solution to the former can readily be provided through the use of cryptographic hashes, while the latter makes use of a neighbourhood watch and threshold-based analysis to detect and correct SF attacks. The scheme proposed here is capable of detecting a selective forwarding attack with over 96% accuracy and successfully identifying the malicious node with 83% accuracy.","487":"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are being used to facilitate monitoring of patients in hospital and home environments.

Tools range from a stand-alone smartphone app to devices with Arduino and 3-D printing, and hence are attractive to a diversity of users; from the general public to more specified maker-and open labware movements. Standardization to common water quality parameters and methods allows long-term storage in regular marine data repositories, such as SeaDataNet and EMODnet, thereby providing open data access. Due to the given intercomparability to existing remote sensing datasets, these tools are ready to complement the marine datapool. In the future, such combined satellite and citizen observations may set measurements by the engaged public in a larger context and hence increase their individual meaning.

We argue that the two value models share the same type of direct environmental effects associated with a similar technological infrastructure; however, their indirect effects differ in prospects of consumer behaviour, environmental awareness and product design. Likewise the difference in structural effects is significant as the NFCC is based on profit maximisation and an accumulation of capital, whereas the HMPP is agnostic to growth and oriented towards the commons.

Aside from the widely discussed chip technology, the external equipment and machinery to operate such a microfluidic chip system comes into focus. A number of companies offer solutions to pursue the various requests made by the microfluidic community. Commercially available systems for pumping fluids are versatile but also highly expensive. Here, we present a fully-programmable pressure source, which is low-cost and can be utilized for pressure-controlled fluid driving, destructive bonding tests, and other pressure-relevant experiments. We evaluated our setup and compared the performance to a commercially available system. Furthermore, we demonstrated the use of the system in the field of droplet microfluidics as a possible application. Our development aims to lower the entrance threshold for microfluidic technology and make it more accessible to a broader audience.","509":"Nearly every practical improvement in modeling human motion is well founded in a properly designed collection of data or datasets.

An efficient labour division model, with the ability to regulate the distribution of work among swarm robots, is an important element of this kind of system. This paper extends the popular response threshold model and proposes a new adaptive response threshold model (ARTM). Experiments were carried out in simulation and in real-robot scenarios with the aim of studying the performance of this new adaptive model. Results presented in this paper verify that the extended approach improves on the adaptability of previous systems. For example, by reducing collision duration among robots in foraging missions, our approach helps small swarms of robots to adapt more efficiently to changing environments, thus increasing their self-sustainability (survival rate). Finally, we propose a minimal version of ARTM, which is derived from the conclusions drawn through real-robot and simulation results.","519":"Developing self-organised swarm systems capable of adapting to environmental changes as well as to dynamic situations is a complex challenge.

By design, LSFM provides fast imaging, and low phototoxicity, two key criteria for live imaging under physiological conditions. Despite its potential, LSFM remains underutilized in plant biology.

These divergent uses of the hashtag are increasingly recognised in the literature, with attention paid especially to the ability for hashtags to facilitate the creation of ad hoc or hashtag publics. A more comprehensive understanding of these different uses of hashtags has yet to be developed, however. Previous research has explored the potential for a systematic analysis of the quantitative metrics that could be generated from processing a series of hashtag datasets. Such research found, for example, that crisis-related hashtags exhibited a significantly larger incidence of retweets and tweets containing URLs than hashtags relating to televised events, and on this basis hypothesised that the information-seeking and -sharing behaviours of Twitter users in such different contexts were substantially divergent. This article updates such study and their methodology by examining the communicative metrics of a considerably larger and more diverse number of hashtag datasets, compiled over the past five years. This provides an opportunity both to confirm earlier findings, as well as to explore whether hashtag use practices may have shifted subsequently as Twitter's userbase has developed further; it also enables the identification of further hashtag types beyond the \"crisis\" and \"mainstream media event\" types outlined to date. The article also explores the presence of such patterns beyond recognised hashtags, by incorporating an analysis of a number of keyword-based datasets. This large-scale, comparative approach contributes towards the establishment of a more comprehensive typology of hashtags and their publics, and the metrics it describes will also be able to be used to classify new hashtags emerging in the future.

This provides an opportunity both to confirm earlier findings, as well as to explore whether hashtag use practices may have shifted subsequently as Twitter's userbase has developed further; it also enables the identification of further hashtag types beyond the \"crisis\" and \"mainstream media event\" types outlined to date. The article also explores the presence of such patterns beyond recognised hashtags, by incorporating an analysis of a number of keyword-based datasets. This large-scale, comparative approach contributes towards the establishment of a more comprehensive typology of hashtags and their publics, and the metrics it describes will also be able to be used to classify new hashtags emerging in the future. In turn, this may enable researchers to develop systems for automatically distinguishing newly trending topics into a number of event types, which may be useful for example for the automatic detection of acute crises and other breaking news events.","545":"Twitter's hashtag functionality is now used for a very wide variety of purposes, from covering crises and other breaking news events through gathering an instant community around shared media texts (such as sporting events and TV broadcasts) to signalling emotive states from amusement to despair. These divergent uses of the hashtag are increasingly recognised in the literature, with attention paid especially to the ability for hashtags to facilitate the creation of ad hoc or hashtag publics. A more comprehensive understanding of these different uses of hashtags has yet to be developed, however. Previous research has explored the potential for a systematic analysis of the quantitative metrics that could be generated from processing a series of hashtag datasets. Such research found, for example, that crisis-related hashtags exhibited a significantly larger incidence of retweets and tweets containing URLs than hashtags relating to televised events, and on this basis hypothesised that the information-seeking and -sharing behaviours of Twitter users in such different contexts were substantially divergent.

Electronics is often ignored in robotics courses. Since robotics courses are typically comprised of computer-related subjects, and mechanical and electrical engineering, these three areas should be emphasized equally. Many studies reveal impressive learning of computer science and mechanical engineering, but clear evidence of the effectiveness of electronics learning in the higher order thinking skills of middle school students is still lacking. We designed three different robotics courses with electronics subject matter introduced through experiential learning. A parallel group design was used, where three different open learning courses were implemented for middle school students. Based on results of the first and second implementations, we improved students' learning of relevant content for each successive step of the experiment. In total, 381 middle school students participated in all experiments and were surveyed using pre- and post-tests. The collected data were analyzed using a quantitative research methodology. The findings revealed that the teaching approach was effective. During the learning process, student interest in robotics increased, and overall achievement improved with a medium effect size (eta(2) = 0.13). The best results for the learning of electronics subject matter were found in the learning process (eta(2) = 0.44), where experimental sharing of electronics parts was the most evident approach used by the students. Examination of learning material structure in light of the shared electronics subject matter is analyzed and discussed and possible directions for future research are presented.","547":"The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether the experiential learning of electronics subject matter is effective in the middle school open learning of robotics.

In particular, heterodyne and homodyne interferometry can accurately measure particle velocity and displacements at a specific point in space thus enabling the acoustical pressure to be measured in an absolute, direct, assumption-free manner, with traceability through the SI definition of the metre. The calibration of a hydrophone can then be performed by placing the active element of the sensor at the point where the acoustic pressure field was measured and monitoring its electrical output. However, it is crucial to validate the performance and accuracy of such optical methods by direct comparison rather than through device calibration. Here we report on the direct comparison of two such optical interferometers used in underwater acoustics and ultrasonics in terms of acoustic pressure estimation and their associated uncertainties in the frequency range 200 kHz-3.5 MHz, with results showing agreement better than 1% in terms of pressure and typical expanded uncertainties better than 3% for both reported methods.","559":"Optical approaches for hydrophone calibrations offer significant advantages over existing methods based on reciprocity.

This shift has considerable socio-economic and cultural implications that are too often ignored by the existing economic and political economy literatures. This article surveys key patterns in the adoption of digital platforms across Europe, and finds, based on an array of quantitative metrics, apparently contradictory trends. We observe, on one hand, the rise of closed TV platforms as the paradigmatic commercial model of the new media landscape; but on the other, the cultural and material openness of the Internet, which is radically transforming the consumption of television. While hybrid arrangements abound, industry solutions are still awkwardly matched to consumer preferences. Without drawing too sharp a line between technology and culture, the article presents an overview of the many ways the changing meaning of digital platforms continues to shape the global television industry.

The proposed method relies strictly on onboard sensors of employed MAVs and does not require any external positioning system. The core of the method consists in extraction of information from pictures consequently captured using a camera carried by the particular MAV. Visual features are obtained from images of the surface under the MAV, and stored into a map that is represented by these features. The position of the MAV is then obtained through matching with previously stored features. An important part of the proposed system is a novel approach for exploration and mapping of the workspace of robots. This method enables efficient exploring of the unknown environment, while keeping the iteratively built map of features consistent. The proposed algorithm is suitable for mapping of surfaces, both outdoor and indoor, with various density of the image features. The sufficient precision and long term persistence of the method allows its utilization for stabilization of large MAV groups that work in formations with small relative distances between particular vehicles. Numerous experiments with quadrotor helicopters and various numerical simulations have been realized for verification of the entire system and its components.","567":"An approach for long term localization, stabilization, and navigation of micro-aerial vehicles (MAVs) in unknown environment is presented in this paper.

This article describes how garage biologists aim to radically transform biotechnological socio-material products and indicate a way of engaging with science and technology that is praxis oriented and builds on sharing, participation, and creativity. We argue that these do-it-yourself biology practices contain significant epistemological similarities with the well-established tradition of action research and indicate that both practices share the political objective to empower individuals to actively build their own future but that they prioritize different strategies. Action research investigates opportunities for empowerment in typical social domains while do-it-yourself biology focuses on the material dimension of socio-technical realities. By reviewing some do-it-yourself biology practices from the core basic principles of action research, the article aims to develop insight whether and in which forms a connectivity can be realized between these different practices leading to future collective actions among these practices.","575":"This paper proposes an attitude estimation method based on optical flow to solve the attitude tracking control problem for a three degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) lab helicopter. First, the relationship between optical flow and the motion of a general unmanned aerial vehicle is derived from the transformation between the image coordinate frame and the world coordinate frame. Then, an expression for the angular velocity of the 3-DOF helicopter is deduced only based on optical flow, and the attitude information is acquired by solving nonlinear equations. Finally, using visual feedback, a linear quadratic regulation (LQR) controller is designed for hovering and tracking, which consists of a feedforward controller and a LQR state feedback controller. Closed-loop experimental results on the lab helicopter demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimation and control methods.","576":"Some earthquakes generate tsunamis in the ocean or coastal regions. An early alert is essential for the coastal population to prevent loss of human life. The propagation of the alert is made through a range of communication means: radio, television, sirens, landlines and cell phones, social media including Twitter, and, if electrical power and communications utilities are blacked-out, through an alternative opportunistic network. In this article, a special device, named Witness Unit (WU), designed to work with a satellite network is presented as an alternative communications means in a temporarily degraded disaster environment.

The general approach relies on technological determinism, whereby the discussion revolves around how and to what extent will ICT support development. It assumes the benefits of ICT as inherent. This approach ignores that ICT is created and experienced within a socially divisive and complex space. A more critical and sociological analysis is needed for development studies to better understand the implications of ICT initiatives. In this article, I argue that Saskia Sassen's analytical framework of technology and society as embedded avoids this technological determinism and allows social theorists to account for social and material aspects of ICT. To support this alternative framework, I present a case study of a rural ICT initiative in Gujarat, India, and discuss how this re-conceptualization reveals more nuanced understanding of ICT and society. Based on interviews and field research, I find that technology creates new social understandings for the rural ICT users, but also that society shapes the technology to make it inaccessible for them.","581":"An emerging topic in the development field is how information and communication technology (ICT) can be used for economic and social development.

Applying supervised learning in robot navigation encounters serious challenges such as inconsistent and noisy data, difficulty for gathering training data, and high error in training data. RL capabilities such as training only by one evaluation scalar signal, and high degree of exploration have encouraged researchers to use RL in robot navigation problem. However, RL algorithms are time consuming as well as suffer from high failure rate in the training phase. Here, we propose Supervised Fuzzy Sarsa Learning (SFSL) as a novel idea for utilizing advantages of both supervised and reinforcement learning algorithms. A zero order Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy controller with some candidate actions for each rule is considered as the main module of robot's controller. The aim of training is to find the best action for each fuzzy rule. In the first step, a human supervisor drives an E-puck robot within the environment and the training data are gathered. In the second step as a hard tuning, the training data are used for initializing the value (worth) of each candidate action in the fuzzy rules. Afterwards, the fuzzy Sarsa learning module, as a critic-only based fuzzy reinforcement learner, fine tunes the parameters of conclusion parts of the fuzzy controller online. The proposed algorithm is used for driving E-puck robot in the environment with obstacles. The experiment results show that the proposed approach decreases the learning time and the number of failures; also it improves the quality of the robot's motion in the testing environments.

Wearables equipped with an array of sensors are able to capture the owner's physiological and behavioural traits, thus are well suited for biometric authentication to control other devices or access digital services. However, wearable biometrics have substantial differences from traditional biometrics for computer systems, such as fingerprints, eye features, or voice. In this article, we discuss these differences and analyse how researchers are approaching the wearable biometrics field. We review and provide a categorization of wearable sensors useful for capturing biometric signals. We analyse the computational cost of the different signal processing techniques, an important practical factor in constrained devices such as wearables. Finally, we review and classify the most recent proposals in the field of wearable biometrics in terms of the structure of the biometric system proposed, their experimental setup, and their results. We also present a critique of experimental issues such as evaluation and feasibility aspects, and offer some final thoughts on research directions that need attention in future work.","619":"Tabletop devices offer an attractive environment for the creation of hybrid board-games that seamlessly integrate physical and digital interaction.

This paper presents \"ToyVision\", a software framework for the prototyping of tabletop games based on the manipulation of conventional playing pieces. ToyVision architecture is based on a Widget layer of abstraction that is able to express the manipulation of playing pieces in the context of the game. This Widget layer supports a wide range of passive and active manipulations with conventional objects. Designers and developers can visually model all passive and active manipulations involved in their game concepts in a Graphic Assistant, and test them immediately in a tabletop device. The paper also describes a set of evaluation sessions which demonstrate that ToyVision has been effective in lowering the threshold of developing applications for tabletop devices, while being sufficiently expressive to give support to innovative concepts for hybrid games that fully explore the tangible feasibilities of conventional playing pieces.","620":"Robots have been recently used as valuable therapeutic devices in numerous studies (especially with children with developmental needs), but their role as more general support for therapists is less well studied. However, as robots become better integrated in therapeutic environments, they will also influence therapists; and if robots are designed correctly, they could positively influence therapists' well-being. Understanding how robots could be used in such a way is especially important as therapists of autistic children (and therapists of mentally disabled people in general) have one of the highest risks of workplace burnout. This paper describes a series of studies conducted to understand therapists' attitudes towards robotic support and to discover what is most needed in such devices; this paper also describes an experimental study of the feasibility of robots playing one of those roles. Through observational studies and a series of ten meetings, with a group of seven therapists of autism, a list of possible roles was created. In a larger questionnaire based study, therapists gave a ranking to various robot roles and functions (a child's behaviour analyser and support in critical\/dangerous situations were given the highest priority). Therapists also stated that they expect robots to help them in the workplace, help prepare documentation and make their work more systematic. In a Wizard-of-Oz type experimental study, a robot was used to play a role of \"emotional mirror\" with seven therapist-child pairs. Study participants stated that a robot was acceptable and was not disturbing, although most did not find it particularly useful. Our conclusions indicate that therapists want robots to play a larger role than just a therapeutic device, and such roles can be added to robots without disturbing sessions with clients.","621":"Robots have been recently used as valuable therapeutic devices in numerous studies (especially with children with developmental needs), but their role as more general support for therapists is less well studied.

Some CAN networks now employ TDMA-based communication in order to help meet real-time constraints. Whilst this form of media access control brings several timeliness benefits, studies have also illustrated negative effects on transmission reliability; duplicated message instances can help to increase this reliability. In this paper a transmission window technique for CAN is proposed. A bounded amount of re-transmission is allowed for each message within this window, which can in many cases provides increased reliability in the presence of errors or bursts of errors. A probabilistic analysis of transmission windows is presented and used to develop a simple algorithm for calculating the optimal window size to achieve a specified statistical guarantee of message delivery. Stochastic simulations along with computational and empirical results are presented which validate the analysis, and indicate that in many circumstances the technique can potentially reduce the amount of bandwidth needed for specified reliability levels when compared to the use of message duplicates. Suggestions are also made to help increase the reliability of message duplications in error burst environments. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The minimalistic OF sensor was robust to high-dynamic-range lighting conditions and to various visual patterns encountered thanks to its M(2)APIX auto-adaptive pixels and the new cross-correlation OF algorithm implemented. The low-cost car-like robot estimated its velocity and steering angle, and therefore its position and orientation, via an extended Kalman filter (EKF) using only two downward-facing OF sensors and the Ackerman steering model. Indoor and outdoor experiments were carried out in which the robot was driven in the closed-loop mode based on the velocity and steering angle estimates. The experimental results obtained show that our novel OF sensor can deliver high-frequency measurements (>300 Hz) in a wide OF range (1.5-15 rad s(-1)) and in a 7-decade high-dynamic light level range. The OF resolution was constant and could be adjusted as required (up to 0.05 rad s(-1)), and the OF precision obtained was relatively high (standard deviation of 0.17 rad s(-1) with an average OF of 4.5 rad s(-1), under the most demanding lighting conditions). An EKF-based algorithm gave the robot's position and orientation with a relatively high accuracy (maximum errors outdoors at a very low light level: 0.95 mand 0.58 rad over about 32 mand 8 pi rad) despite the low-resolution control systems of the steering servo and the DC motor, as well as a simplified model identification and calibration. Finally, the minimalistic OF-based odometry results were compared to those obtained using measurements based on an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a motor's speed sensor.","626":"Here we present a novel bio-inspired optic flow (OF) sensor and its application to visual. guidance and odometry on a low-cost car-like robot called BioCarBot.

Developers rely on them for design space exploration and software debugging. However, with rising HW\/SW complexity and the need to simulate more and more processors simultaneously, the performance of virtual platforms degrades rapidly. Parallel simulation techniques can help to counter this by leveraging multicore PCs, which are widely available today. This work presents a novel parallel simulation approach that is targeted toward acceleration of virtual platforms from the ESL domain. By trading some timing accuracy, multiprocessor virtual platforms can be accelerated by up to 3.4x on regular quad-core workstations.","643":"Grand challenges are among the most complex problems for modern societies. Many governments and foundations provide substantial resources to encourage the search for solutions. Due to the significance of these problems, organizations often form partnerships in what we call search consortia to engage in joint search and compete for funding. Prior research on joint search highlights the role of specialized organizations, mainly regarding technological domains, to identify a superior solution. However, stakeholder theory leads us to believe that the success of any solution depends on the acceptance and support of important stakeholders. In this study, we suggest that search consortia are more likely to receive funding when they include representatives of stakeholder concerns, so-called advocacy groups. We extend theory on coordinated exploration in joint search by integrating mechanisms from stakeholder theory and argue that advocacy groups improve the generation of potential solutions and provide legitimacy. We test our theory with a unique dataset of 35,249 consortia that proposed solutions to 2,349 grand challenge problems as part of a large European funding program.

The overwhelming amount of produced content and resulting network traffic gives rise to precarious scalability issues for social networks, such as handling a large number of users, infrastructure management, internal network traffic, content dissemination, and data storage. There are few surveys conducted to explore the different dimensions of social networks, such as security, privacy, and data acquisition. Most of the surveys focus on privacy or security-related issues and do not specifically address scalability challenges faced by social networks. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive study of social networks along with their significant characteristics and categorize social network architectures into three broad categories: (a) centralized, (b) decentralized, and (c) hybrid. We also highlight various scalability issues faced by social network architectures. Finally, a qualitative comparison of presented architectures is provided, which is based on various scalability metrics, such as availability, latency, interserver communication, cost of resources, and energy consumption, just to name a few.","645":"In optogenetics, researchers use light and genetically encoded photoreceptors to control biological processes with unmatched precision. However, outside of neuroscience, the impact of optogenetics has been limited by a lack of user-friendly, flexible, accessible hardware. Here, we engineer the Light Plate Apparatus (LPA), a device that can deliver two independent 310 to 1550 nm light signals to each well of a 24-well plate with intensity control over three orders of magnitude and millisecond resolution. Signals are programmed using an intuitive web tool named Iris. All components can be purchased for under $400 and the device can be assembled and calibrated by a non-expert in one day. We use the LPA to precisely control gene expression from blue, green, and red light responsive optogenetic tools in bacteria, yeast, and mammalian cells and simplify the entrainment of cyanobacterial circadian rhythm. The LPA dramatically reduces the entry barrier to optogenetics and photobiology experiments.","646":"Smart meters are an enabling technology for many smart grid applications.

The platform proposed here is intended for research which trades smaller population size with more sophisticated individual robot capabilities. The validation of proposed swarm robotic algorithms using real-world hardware is essential, but is fraught with difficulty due to the expense and complexity of developing and maintaining multiple operational units. A number of open hardware platforms have been proposed, although most prioritize small size and low cost over advanced capabilities such as vision. We are interested in a number of different research directions which utilize vision as a core capability and find the existing open hardware platforms to be insufficient (and existing commercial platforms too expensive). In this paper we describe a set of desirable characteristics for an open, extensible visually-guided robot platform. We then present our solution, the BuPiGo (pronounced buppy-go), describing the hardware itself and a model developed for simulation purposes. We also present some initial results on using the BuPiGo for visual homing an individual navigation task that we hope to exploit for swarm tasks in the future.","648":["The deformation monitoring of structures and buildings is an important task field of modern engineering surveying, ensuring the standing and reliability of supervised objects over a long period.

A symbiotic software and hardware approach facilitates the animation process for novice and expert users alike. We overcome limitations inherent to all previous tangible devices by allowing users to directly control complex rigs using only a small set (5-10) of physical controls. This avoids oversimplification of the pose space and excessively bulky device configurations. Our algorithm derives a small device configuration from complex character rigs, often containing hundreds of degrees of freedom, and a set of sparse sample poses. Importantly, only the most influential degrees of freedom are controlled directly, yet detailed motion is preserved based on a pose interpolation technique. We designed a modular collection of joints and splitters, which can be assembled to represent a wide variety of skeletons. Each joint piece combines a universal joint and two twisting elements, allowing to accurately sense its configuration. The mechanical design provides a smooth inverse kinematics-like user experience and is not prone to gimbal locking.

This can result in measurement errors in time-dependent assays along with inaccuracies due to liquid displacement and bubble formation in the absence of a stabilising centrifugal field. This paper presents a novel concept for a wirelessly electrified-Lab-on-a-Disc (eLoaD) platform that allows continuous measurement of experimental parameters while the disc is spinning. This platform incorporates all the components needed for measurement within the rotating frame of reference, and bidirectional transmission of data outside this reference frame, thus allowing for online measurement independent of the rotation of the disc. The eLoaD platform is conceived in a modular manner whereby an interchangeable and non-disposable 'Application Disc' can be fitted to the eLoaD platform and so the system can be adapted for a range of optical, electrochemical and other measurement types. As an application example, optical readout, using the Application Disc fitted with a silicon photomultiplier, is demonstrated using a tagged chemiluminescent antibody, which is commonly used, for instance, in ELISA assays. The precision of the eLoaD platform is >94%, while its accuracy, when compared to a commercial benchtop luminometer, is higher than 96%.

According to the on-line questionnaire, 80% of students in 2010-2012 replied that the lecture was useful for their future career. The task given to students was to design and realise an autonomous electronic information devices (so-called the IoT-gadgets') by themselves, and conduct a live demonstration in front of their colleagues. The device must have an input', output', and some information processing'. Being aware of the speed of technology evolution as well as the short hours of the lecture, the professor tried not to give direct answers to students' questions on how-to instantly build and program an information device. Instead, the students were told to beware of their methods'. This refers to the deductive thinking introduced by Rene Descartes, and in the lecture's context how students should behave in order to realise the device. In this study, the backgrounds of various associated topics are discussed, such as the UTokyo's educational system, the world's rapid prototyping movement, open hardware, course design, students' reactions, and future directions.","677":"The concept of agency is ubiquitous in STS, particularly regarding cases of alternative ways of knowing and doing science such as civic, citizen, and feminist sciences, among others. Yet the focus on agency often glosses over the constraints placed on agents, particularly within asymmetrical power relations. This article follows the case of BabyLegs, a do-it-yourself monitoring tool for marine microplastic pollution, and the attempt to keep the technology open source within an intellectual property (IP) system set up to privatize it. The tactics used to design BabyLegs as a feminine, silly, doll-tool to discredit the device in the eyes of an IP system that valued traditional gender roles lead to the eventual success of keeping the device open source. Yet, those same tactics also reinforced and reproduced the structures of power and essentialism they were designed to resist. I characterize this technological ambivalence as compromise, and argue that all agency exercised within asymmetrical power relations is compromised. This is not to say resistance is futile, but that agency is never pure, and this recognition lets us be more intentional in how we might compromise as practitioners of diverse scientific knowledges.","678":"Working together, heated and unheated temperature sensors can recognize contact with different materials and contact with the human body. As such, distributing these sensors across a robot's body could be beneficial for operation in human environments. We present a stretchable fabric-based skin with force and thermal sensors that is suitable for covering areas of a robot's body, including curved surfaces. It also adds a layer of compliance that conforms to manipulated objects, improving thermal sensing. Our open hardware design addresses thermal sensing challenges, such as the time to heat the sensors, the efficiency of sensing, and the distribution of sensors across the skin. It incorporates small self-heated temperature sensors on the surface of the skin that directly make contact with objects, improving the sensors' response times. Our approach seeks to fully cover the robot's body with large force sensors, but treats temperature sensors as small, point-like sensors sparsely distributed across the skin. We present a mathematical model to help predict how many of these point-like temperature sensors should be used in order to increase the likelihood of them making contact with an object. To evaluate our design, we conducted tests in which a robot arm used a cylindrical end effector covered with skin to slide objects and press on objects made from four different materials. After assessing the safety of our design, we also had the robot make contact with the forearms and clothed shoulders of 10 human participants. With 2.0 s of contact, the actively-heated temperature sensors enabled binary classification accuracy over 90% for the majority of material pairs. The system could more rapidly distinguish between materials with large differences in their thermal effusivities (e.g., 90% accuracy for pine wood vs. aluminum with 0.5 s of contact). For discrimination between humans vs. the four materials, the skin's force and thermal sensing modalities achieved 93% classification accuracy with 0.5 s of contact. Overall, our results suggest that our skin design could enable robots to recognize contact with distinct task-relevant materials and humans while performing manipulation tasks in human environments.

One way to support stronger end users' engagement with such complex technologies is by involving them in the design process and, with the advent of Arduino prototyping platform, even in their making. While DIY practice offers the potential for stronger user engagement with physical artifacts, we know little about end users' DIY practice of making complex electronic technologies and their potential to ensure engagement with such devices. In this article, we report on interviews with 18 participants from two green communities who built and used an open source DIY energy monitor, with the aim to explore the end users DIY practices of making such complex electronic devices. Findings indicate four key qualities of DIY monitors: transparent modularity, open-endedness, heirloom, and disruptiveness, and how they contribute to more meaningful engagement with the DIY monitors, elevating them from the status of unremarkable objects to that of things. We conclude with three implications for design for supporting end user development of complex electronic DIY: designing transparent open hardware technologies, standardizing communication protocols for the current and future DIY of IoT, and deliberately calling for personal investment and labor in the assembling of DIY kits.","680":"Microfluidic devices have the potential to automate and miniaturize biological experiments, but open-source sharing of device designs has lagged behind sharing of other resources such as software. Synthetic biologists have used microfluidics for DNA assembly, cell-free expression, and cell culture, but a combination of expense, device complexity, and reliance on custom set-ups hampers their widespread adoption. We present Metafluidics, an open-source, community-driven repository that hosts digital design files, assembly specifications, and open-source software to enable users to build, configure, and operate a microfluidic device. We use Metafluidics to share designs and fabrication instructions for both a microfluidic ring-mixer device and a 32-channel tabletop microfluidic controller. This device and controller are applied to build genetic circuits using standard DNA assembly methods including ligation, Gateway, Gibson, and Golden Gate. Metafluidics is intended to enable a broad community of engineers, DIY enthusiasts, and other nontraditional participants with limited fabrication skills to contribute to microfluidic research.","681":"Air levitation is the process by which an object is lifted without mechanical support in a stable position, by providing an upward force that counteracts the gravitational force exerted on the object.

Within the UK alone, we dispose of approximately 10,000 garments every ten minutes (Kerr & Foster, 2011). This project focuses specifically on the practice of textile and fashion design in the UK to consider a more holistic approach for designing and manufacturing within these sectors. Our research aims are to explore the contribution open design can make in implementing the circular economy and thus a more sustainable material future.

To produce highly customized products with limited resources, personal manufacturers require data management tools for integrated product design and manufacturing. However, the current separated and dedicated design and manufacturing information systems for mass production cannot satisfy the requirements of personal manufacturing. To solve this problem, this study introduces an extended product data model that has data objects for bills of processes (BOP), customer orders and manufacturing operation linked to 3D printing services through Internet of things (IOTs) technologies. The extended product data model can support product design, process planning, production planning, and execution of manufacturing operation in a unified single user environment. To demonstrate the applicability of the model, this study implemented it as a prototype product data management (PDM) system and applied the system to an example product development.","687":"This work demonstrates a low-cost, miniature data repository proof-of-concept.

Airchive employs a relational database for storing data and implements two standards for sharing data (namely the Sensor Observation Service by the Open Geospatial Consortium and the Protocol for Metadata Harvesting by the Open Archives Initiative). The system is demonstrated in a realistic indoor air pollution data acquisition scenario in a four-month experiment evaluating its autonomy and robustness under power and network disruptions. A stress test was also conducted to evaluate its performance against concurrent client requests.","688":"The challenge raised by the introduction of Internet of Things (IoT) concept will permanently shape the networking and communications landscape and will therefore have a significant social impact.

Closed-loop experiments, in which causal interventions are conditioned on the state of the system under investigation, have become increasingly common in neuroscience. Such experiments can have a high degree of explanatory power, but they require a precise implementation that can be difficult to replicate across laboratories. We sought to overcome this limitation by building open-source software that makes it easier to develop and share algorithms for closed-loop control. Approach. We created the Open Ephys GUI, an opensource platform for multichannel electrophysiology experiments. In addition to the standard 'open-loop' visualization and recording functionality, the GUI also includes modules for delivering feedback in response to events detected in the incoming data stream. Importantly, these modules can be built and shared as plugins, which makes it possible for users to extend the functionality of the GUI through a simple API, without having to understand the inner workings of the entire application. Main results. In combination with low-cost, open-source hardware for amplifying and digitizing neural signals, the GUI has been used for closedloop experiments that perturb the hippocampal theta rhythm in a phase-specific manner. Significance. The Open Ephys GUI is the first widely used application for multichannel electrophysiology that leverages a plugin-based workflow. We hope that it will lower the barrier to entry for electrophysiologists who wish to incorporate real-time feedback into their research.","691":"The objective of this paper is to describe an ergonomics contribution in maintainability. The economical designs, inputs and training helps to increase the maintainability indicators for industrial devices. This analysis can be helpful, among other cases, to compare systems, to achieve a better design regarding maintainability requirements, to improve this maintainability under specific industrial environment and to foresee maintainability problems due to eventual changes in a device operation conditions. With this purpose, this work first introduces the notion of ergonomics and human factors, maintainability and the implementation of assessment of human postures, including some important postures to perform maintenance activities. A simulation approach is used to identify the critical posture of the maintenance personnel and implements the defined postures with minimal loads on the personnel who use the equipment in a practical scenario.

There are multiple processes in the manufacturing industry and will eventually generate a large amount of data. Collecting, analyzing and storing a large amount of data are one of key elements of the smart manufacturing industry. To ensure that all processes within the manufacturing industry are functioning smoothly, the big data processing is needed. Thus, in this study an open source-based real-time data processing (OSRDP) architecture framework was proposed. OSRDP architecture framework consists of several open sources technologies, including Apache Kafka, Apache Storm and NoSQL MongoDB that are effective and cost efficient for real-time data processing. Several experiments and impact analysis for manufacturing sustainability are provided. The results showed that the proposed system is capable of processing a massive sensor data efficiently when the number of sensors data and devices increases. In addition, the data mining based on Random Forest is presented to predict the quality of products given the sensor data as the input. The Random Forest successfully classifies the defect and non-defect products, and generates high accuracy compared to other data mining algorithms.

This approach is refined here to develop a novel instrument capable of performing automated large-area four-point probe measurements. The designs for conversion of a RepRap 3-D printer to a 2-D open source four-point probe (OS4PP) measurement device are detailed for the mechanical and electrical systems. Free and open source software and firmware are developed to operate the tool. The OS4PP was validated against a wide range of discrete resistors and indium tin oxide (ITO) samples of different thicknesses both pre- and post-annealing. The OS4PP was then compared to two commercial proprietary systems. Results of resistors from 10 to 1 M show errors of less than 1% for the OS4PP. The 3-D mapping of sheet resistance of ITO samples successfully demonstrated the automated capability to measure non-uniformities in large-area samples. The results indicate that all measured values are within the same order of magnitude when compared to two proprietary measurement systems. In conclusion, the OS4PP system, which costs less than 70% of manual proprietary systems, is comparable electrically while offering automated 100 micron positional accuracy for measuring sheet resistance over larger areas.","694":"Globalization, variation in customer expectations, and the developments connected to Information & Communication Technology are usually considered as the main drivers of changes in Operations Management (OM) strategies by firms in both manufacturing and service industries.

Concerning demand side factors the paper demonstrates how potential market size and existing technology trajectory work in favor of IoT diffusion. As a related demand side factor the paper argues that, in terms of the technological trajectory, China has started farther from the frontier than most industrialized countries. The degree of incremental benefit from the IoT is thus higher in the country. As to the supply side factors, the article promotes an understanding of how Chinese technology companies have capitalized on a huge user base to develop IoT-based applications. It also suggests that technologies and expertise provided by foreign multinationals have also played crucial roles. Regarding formal institutions, the government's proactive policies have been a major factor in the IoT's evolution. It is also in the Chinese government's interest to develop IoT products to make censorship and surveillance more effective. Regarding informal institutions, Chinese consumers are less concerned than Westerners about being tracked and monitored, which provides a favorable condition for the adoption of IoT-enabled devices. Nonetheless, this condition is changing due to increasing abuse of consumer privacy. China and the U.S. are compared in terms of diffusion, key determinants, performance indicators and impacts of the IoT in order to understand the areas that China outperforms-and underperform-the U.S. Some indicators are proposed to gauge the IoT-related performance and the impacts of the IoT.","696":"In the recent years a major change in the engineering process of mechatronics and robotics has taken place.

This chapter aims to give an overview of the impact of this change, using many examples from various projects, and will share some insights and lessons learned for facilitating and implementing this process.","697":"Monitoring mechanisms that ensure efficient crop growth are essential on many farms, especially in certain areas of the planet where water is scarce. Most farmers must assume the high cost of the required equipment in order to be able to streamline natural resources on their farms. Considering that many farmers cannot afford to install this equipment, it is necessary to look for more effective solutions that would be cheaper to implement. The objective of this study is to build virtual organizations of agents that can communicate between each other while monitoring crops. A low cost sensor architecture allows farmers to monitor and optimize the growth of their crops by streamlining the amount of resources the crops need at every moment. Since the hardware has limited processing and communication capabilities, our approach uses the PANGEA architecture to overcome this limitation. Specifically, we will design a system that is capable of collecting heterogeneous information from its environment, using sensors for temperature, solar radiation, humidity, pH, moisture and wind. A major outcome of our approach is that our solution is able to merge heterogeneous data from sensors and produce a response adapted to the context. In order to validate the proposed system, we present a case study in which farmers are provided with a tool that allows us to monitor the condition of crops on a TV screen using a low cost device.","698":"Critical approaches to the smart city concept are used to begin highlighting the promises of makerspaces, that is to say, those emerging urban sites that promote sharing practices; exercise community-based forms of governance; and utilize local manufacturing technologies.

Since its inception in the 90s, the Object Linking and Embedding for Process Control (OPC) protocol has provided open connectivity for monitoring and automation systems. It has been widely used in several environments such as industrial facilities, building and energy automation, engineering education and many others. This paper presents a novel OPC-based architecture to implement automation systems devoted to R&D and educational activities. The proposal is a novel conceptual framework, structured into four functional layers where the diverse components are categorized aiming to foster the systematic design and implementation of automation systems involving OPC communication. Due to the benefits of OPC, the proposed architecture provides features like open connectivity, reliability, scalability, and flexibility. Furthermore, four successful experimental applications of such an architecture, developed at the University of Extremadura (UEX), are reported. These cases are a proof of concept of the ability of this architecture to support interoperability for different domains. Namely, the automation of energy systems like a smart microgrid and photobioreactor facilities, the implementation of a network-accessible industrial laboratory and the development of an educational hardware-in-the-loop platform are described. All cases include a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) to automate and control the plant behavior, which exchanges operative data (measurements and signals) with a multiplicity of sensors, instruments and supervisory systems under the structure of the novel OPC architecture.

Despite the fact that crowdsensing approaches could be an adequate solution for urban areas, they cannot be implemented in rural environments. Instead, deploying a fleet of UAVs could be considered an acceptable alternative. Embracing this approach, this paper proposes the use of UAVs equipped with off-the-shelf sensors to perform air pollution monitoring tasks. These UAVs are guided by our proposed Pollution-driven UAV Control (PdUC) algorithm, which is based on a chemotaxis metaheuristic and a local particle swarm optimization strategy. Together, they allow automatically performing the monitoring of a specified area using UAVs. Experimental results show that, when using PdUC, an implicit priority guides the construction of pollution maps by focusing on areas where the pollutants' concentration is higher. This way, accurate maps can be constructed in a faster manner when compared to other strategies. The PdUC scheme is compared against various standard mobility models through simulation, showing that it achieves better performance. In particular, it is able to find the most polluted areas with more accuracy and provides a higher coverage within the time bounds defined by the UAV flight time.","702":"Automotive instrumentation is an important process to guarantee quality and safety for the drivers and passengers of vehicles. At the same time, it is a time-consuming task, because engineers must setup the system, which includes the passing of cables through the vehicle and the configuration of equipments. A wireless automotive instrumentation system can certainly help on reducing the instrumentation time and its cost. However, it may incur in errors due to the wireless communication between sensors and the base station. In this study, the authors propose a low-cost wireless monitoring system for automotive instrumentation. They compare the proposed system with two commercial instrumentation equipments in terms of features, cost, and precision for monitoring the engine speed. The results indicate that the proposed wireless monitoring system delivers similar performance, but at a lower cost (up to 1114 times cheaper).","703":"This research paper represents a numerical approximation to non-linear three dimension reaction diffusion equation with non-linear source term from population genetics. Since various initial and boundary value problems exist in three dimension reaction diffusion phenomena, which are studied numerically by different numerical methods, here we use finite difference schemes (Alternating Direction Implicit and Fourth Order Douglas Implicit) to approximate the solution. Accuracy is studied in term of L-2, L-infinity and relative error norms by random selected grids along time levels for comparison with analytical results.

The SBS2 system consists of an Android tablet wirelessly connected to a 14-electrode EasyCap headset (cost similar to 300 USD). SBS2 and standard EEG were performed in people with suspected epilepsy in Bhutan (2014-2015), and recordings were interpreted by neurologists. Among 205 participants (54% female, median age 24 years), epileptiform discharges were detected on 14% of SBS2 and 25% of standard EEGs. The SBS2 had 39.2% sensitivity (95% confidence interval (CI) 25.8%, 53.9%) and 94.8% specificity (95% CI 90.0%, 97.7%) for epileptiform discharges with positive and negative predictive values of 0.71 (95% CI 0.51, 0.87) and 0.82 (95% CI 0.76, 0.89) respectively. 31% of focal and 82% of generalized abnormalities were identified on SBS2 recordings. Cohen's kappa (kappa) for the SBS2 EEG and standard EEG for the epileptiform versus non-epileptiform outcome was kappa = 0.40 (95% CI 0.25, 0.55). No safety or tolerability concerns were reported. Despite limitations in sensitivity, the SBS2 may become a viable supportive test for the capture of epileptiform abnormalities, and extend EEG access to new, especially resource-limited, populations at a reduced cost.","707":"The Sonic Kayak is a musical instrument used to investigate nature and developed during open hacklab events.

Thus, our model allows for the analysis and comparison of a broad scope of constellations, their particular coordinating mechanisms as well as related advantages and disadvantages.

We focus the research on the critical role of makerspace managers\/founders who are recognised as gatekeepers to circular practices. The research method is action-led including expert interviews (academics and founders\/managers) as well as two generative context-mapping workshops, run at selected makerspaces in collaboration with their founders\/managers. We unearth everyday 'how-to' guidance to interweave circular practices within makerspaces from the outset by: fostering an enabling culture; building local connections; nurturing individual\/community capacities; and stimulating practical know-how. However, while the research reveals immense opportunities to cultivate circular literacy from within makerspaces, the prospects to ask more profound questions about our economy, through makerspace practices, are found to be compromised by day-today concerns. The insights from this research can act as a starting point for future work in this emerging research area.","712":"In animal behavioral biology, an automated observing\/training system may be useful for several reasons: (a) continuous observation of animals for documentation of specific, irregular events, (b) long-term intensive training of animals in preparation for behavioral experiments, (c) elimination of potential cues and biases induced by humans during training and testing. Here, we describe an open-source-based system named CATOS (Computer Aided Training\/Observing System) developed for such situations. There are several notable features in this system. CATOS is flexible and low cost because it is based on free open-source software libraries, common hardware parts, and open-system electronics based on Arduino. Automated video condensation is applied, leading to significantly reduced video data storage compared to the total active hours of the system. A data-viewing utility program helps a user browse recorded data quickly and more efficiently. With these features, CATOS has the potential to be applied to many different animal species in various environments such as laboratories, zoos, or even private homes. Also, an animal's free access to the device without constraint, and a gamified learning process, enhance the animal's welfare and enriches their environment. As a proof of concept, the system was built and tested with two different species. Initially, the system was tested for approximately 10 months with a domesticated cat. The cat was successfully and fully automatically trained to discriminate three different spoken words. Then, in order to test the system's adaptability to other species and hardware components, we used it to train a laboratory rat for 3 weeks.","713":"Continuous monitoring of earth flow displacement is essential for the understanding of the dynamic of the process, its ongoing evolution and designing mitigation measures. Despite its importance, it is not always applied due to its expense and the need for integration with additional sensors to monitor factors controlling movement. To overcome these problems, we developed and tested a low-cost Arduino-based wire-rail extensometer integrating a data logger, a power system and multiple digital and analog inputs. The system is equipped with a high-precision position transducer that in the test configuration offers a measuring range of 1023mm and an associated accuracy of +\/- 1 mm, and integrates an operating temperature sensor that should allow potential thermal drift that typically affects this kind of systems to be identified and corrected. A field test, conducted at the Pietrafitta earth flow where additional monitoring systems had been installed, indicates a high reliability of the measurement and a high monitoring stability without visible thermal drift.","714":"Pushed by the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm modern sensor networks monitor a wide range of phenomena, in areas such as environmental monitoring, health care, industrial processes, and smart cities. These networks provide a continuous pulse of the almost infinite activities that are happening in the physical space and are thus, key enablers for a Digital Earth Nervous System. Nevertheless, the rapid processing of these sensor data streams still continues to challenge traditional data-handling solutions and new approaches are being requested. We propose a generic answer to this challenge, which has the potential to support any form of distributed real-time analysis. This neutral methodology follows a brokering approach to work with different kinds of data sources and uses web-based standards to achieve interoperability. As a proof of concept, we implemented the methodology to detect anomalies in real-time and applied it to the area of environmental monitoring. The developed system is capable of detecting anomalies, generating notifications, and displaying the recent situation to the user.","715":"In this paper, a set of digital artifacts related to simple examples of structural engineering are presented. The artifacts are real-time applications and visualizations of typical problems students from the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) schools are acquainted with. The real-time nature of the examples allow a high level of interaction between humans and the classic visualization of results, namely, bending and shear force diagrams, internal stresses distributions, and contour plots. These artifacts may provide in AEC a twofold educational target: (i) for users, to provide visual understanding in real time of typical problems that must be understood in classic lectures of structural engineering; (ii) for developers, to provide meaningful applications of applied digital fabrication using sensors, microcontrollers, and GUI's and their potential in the development of tools related to Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) and the Internet of Things (IoT) among students of the AEC sector.","716":"The introduction of mobile devices has changed our daily lives. They enable users to obtain information even in a nomadic environment and provide information without limitations. A decade after the introduction of this technology, we are now facing the next innovation that will change our daily lives. With the introduction of the Internet of Things (IoT), our communication ability will not be restricted to only mobile devices. Rather, it will expand to all things with which we coexist. Many studies have discussed IoT-related services and platforms. However, there are only limited discussions about the IoT network. In this paper, we will thoroughly analyze the technical details about the IoT network. Based on our survey of papers, we will provide insight about the future IoT network and the crucial components that will enable","717":"A 1-year data set of ground-based GPS signal observations aiming at geometric elevation angles below +2 degrees is analysed. Within the \"GLESER\" measurement campaign about 2600 validated setting events were recorded by the \"OpenGPS\" open-loop tracking receiver at an observation site located at 52.3808 degrees N, 13.0642 degrees E between January and December 2014. The measurements confirm the feasibility of open-loop signal tracking down to geometric elevation angles of -1 to -1.5 degrees extending the corresponding closed-loop tracking range by up to 1 degrees. The study is based on the premise that observations of low-elevation events by a ground-based receiver may serve as test cases for space-based radio occultation measurements, even if the latter proceed at a significantly faster temporal scale. The results support the conclusion that the open-loop Doppler model has negligible influence on the derived carrier frequency profile for strong signal-to-noise density ratios above about 30 dB Hz. At lower signal levels, however, the OpenGPS receiver's dual-channel design, which tracks the same signal using two Doppler models differing by 10 Hz, uncovers a notable bias. The repeat patterns of the GPS orbit traces in terms of azimuth angle reveal characteristic signatures in both signal amplitude and Doppler frequency with respect to the topography close to the observation site. Mean vertical refractivity gradients, extracted from ECMWF meteorological fields, correlate weakly to moderately with observed signal amplitude fluctuations at geometric elevation angles between +1 and +2 degrees. Results from multiple phase screen simulations support the interpretation that these fluctuations are at least partly produced by atmospheric multipath; at negative elevation angles diffraction at the ground surface seems to contribute.","718":"The Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Cloud technologies today provide new options for remote measurement data collection, storage and processing. Fuel tank calibration process automation by adapting IoT infrastructure model is explored in the article.

A distributed certified metrological laboratory establishment in the field of fuel tank calibration concept is introduced and explained by system architecture view description and sequence diagram of its operation.","719":"Since the life cycle of smartphones is becoming shorter, users are demanding new and improved smartphone features for updated smartphones, but it is difficult to know which features are the most important to users. In Internet user communities, users increasingly review smartphone functions and share information about their experiences such as complaints, problems, and satisfaction, and these user experiences have been fruitful sources for manufacturers that lead to smartphone improvements. Focusing on these user experiences, this paper proposes a systematic roadmapping process including prioritisation of smartphone feature requirements. By prioritising smartphone feature requirements, new and improved versions of smartphones that reflect user needs can be planned based on a product-market roadmap. The systematic approach consists of three parts: user-driven quality function deployment (QFD), a frequent pattern (FP)-tree algorithm, and a product-market roadmap. First, we collected data extracted from text mining in Internet user communities to construct a user-driven QFD. Second, using user experiences related to smartphone features, we applied the FP-tree algorithm to algorithmically derive a priority list of smartphone feature requirements. Finally, based on the result of the FP-tree of smartphones, we proposed guidelines to construct a product-market roadmap. It is expected that a versioning strategy can be formulated through this prioritised product-market roadmap. Furthermore, covering each step from data collection to roadmapping, this study suggests a systematic process for prioritisation of smartphone feature requirements based on user experiences.","720":"The high stakes of emergent environmental crises, from climate change to widespread toxic exposures, have motivated STS practitioners to innovate methodologically, including leveraging STS scholarship to actively remake environmental scientific practice and technologies. This thematic collection brings together current research that transforms how communities and academics identify, study, and collectively respond to contaminants engendered by the fossil fuel and petrochemical industries, including air contamination from hydraulic fracking, marine pollution from petroleum-derived plastics, and hydrocarbon derivatives such as formaldehyde that intoxicate our homes. These interventions make inroads into the \"undone science\" and \"regimes of imperceptibility\" of environmental health crises. Authors, most of whom are practitioners, investigate grassroots methods for collaboratively designing and developing low-cost monitoring tools, crowdsourcing data analysis, and imagining ways of redressing toxicity outside of the idioms of science. Collectively, these articles work towards remaking how knowledge is made about and across industrial systems by networking community grounded approaches for accounting for environmental health issues created by the fossil fuels and allied petrochemical industries.","721":["Public sector innovation is an important issue in the agenda of policymakers and academics but there is a need for a change of perspective, one that promotes a more open model of innovating, which takes advantage of the possibilities offered by collaboration between citizens, entrepreneurs and civil society as well as of new emerging technologies. Living labs are environments that can support public open innovation processes.","This article makes a practical contribution to understand the role of living labs as intermediaries of public open innovation. The analysis focuses on the dynamics of these innovation intermediaries, their outcomes, and their main challenges. In particular, it adopts a qualitative approach (fourteen semi-structured interviews and one focus group were conducted) in order to analyze two living labs: Citilab in the city of Cornelia and the network of fab athenaeums (public fab labs) in the city of Barcelona, both in Spain. After a thorough analysis of the attributes of these living labs, the article concludes that 1) living labs provide the opportunity for public agencies to meet with private sector organizations and thus function as innovation intermediaries, 2) implementing an open innovation perspective is considered more important than obtaining specific innovation results, and 3) scalability and sustainability are the main problems living labs encounter as open innovation intermediaries.

In Parkinson's disease, a disease-specific physiomarker was identified that is now used to investigate adaptive closed-loop stimulation in first studies. In dystonia, such a physiomarker is missing.","MethodsPallidal oscillations were recorded from 153 contact pairs in 27 patients. We investigated whether power amplitudes in theta and beta bands correlate with dystonic symptom severity across patients. We then projected theta power from each contact pair onto standard subcortical anatomy. In this way, we defined a theta hot spot on a group level and investigated whether proximity of the active DBS contacts to it correlated with clinical improvement.","ResultsDystonic symptom severity significantly correlated with theta but not beta oscillatory amplitudes (=0.4, p=0.009) and interhemispheric coherence (=0.5, p=0.002). The sweet spot of theta activity localized to the posterior third of the internal pallidum and theta power correlated with proximity to this location (=0.23, p=0.002), which coincided with 3 previously published coordinates describing optimal stimulation targets. Finally, motor improvement through pallidal long-term DBS correlated with theta peak amplitude (=0.38, p=0.018).","InterpretationOur findings suggest that theta oscillations in the internal pallidum are robustly associated with dystonic symptoms in cervical dystonia and may be a useful biomarker for adaptive closed-loop stimulation. Furthermore, theta oscillatory activity may have a predictive value for the clinical benefit after chronic DBS that could be used to improve intraoperative neurophysiological target mapping during electrode implantation.

The target application of the stimulator is to induce retinal degeneration in fly photoreceptor cells by exposing them to light in a controlled manner. The goal of this work is to obtain a reproducible system for studying age-related changes in susceptibility to environmental ocular stress. The stimulator uses light emitting diodes and an embedded computer to control illuminance, color (blue or red) and duration in two independent chambers. Further, the stimulator is equipped with per-chamber light and temperature sensors and a fan to monitor light intensity and to control temperature. An ON\/OFF temperature control implemented on the embedded computer keeps the temperature from reaching levels that will induce the heat shock stress response in the flies. A custom enclosure was fabricated to house the electronic components of the stimulator. The enclosure provides a light-impermeable environment that allows air flow and lets users easily load and unload fly vials. Characterization results show that the fabricated stimulator can produce light at illuminances ranging from 0 to 16000 lux and power density levels from 0 to 7.2 mW\/cm(2) for blue light. For red light the maximum illuminance is 8000 lux which corresponds to a power density of 3.54 mW\/cm(2). The fans and the ON\/OFF temperature control are able to keep the temperature inside the chambers below 28.17 degrees C. Experiments with white-eye male flies were performed to assess the ability of the fabricated simulator to induce blue light-dependent retinal degeneration. Retinal degeneration is observed in flies exposed to 8 h of blue light at 7949 lux. Flies in a control experiment with no light exposure show no retinal degeneration. Flies exposed to red light for the similar duration and light intensity (8 h and 7994 lux) do not show retinal degeneration either. Hence, the fabricated stimulator can be used to create environmental ocular stress using blue light. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Consuming minimum gasoline during the trip is a common goal for most energy management controllers. To achieve these objectives, an intelligent energy management controller for EREV based on dynamic programming and neural networks (IEMC_NN) is proposed. The power demand split ratio between the extender and battery are optimized by DP, and the control objectives are presented as a cost function. The online controller is trained by neural networks. Three trained controllers, constructing the controller library in IEMC_NN, are obtained from training three typical lengths of the driving cycle. To determine an appropriate NN controller for different driving distance purposes, the selection module in IEMC_NN is developed based on the remaining battery energy and the driving distance to the charging station. Three simulation conditions are adopted to validate the performance of IEMC_NN. They are target driving distance information, known and unknown, changing the destination during the trip. Simulation results using these simulation conditions show that the IEMC_NN had better fuel economy than the charging deplete\/charging sustain (CD\/CS) algorithm. More significantly, with known driving distance information, the battery SOC controlled by IEMC_NN can just reach the lower bound as the EREV arrives at the charging station, which was also feasible when the driver changed the destination during the trip.","725":"This paper presents a technical overview of Team DRC-Hubo@UNLV's approach to the 2015 DARPA Robotics Challenge Finals (DRC-Finals). The Finals required a robotic platform that was robust and reliable in both hardware and software to complete tasks in 60 min under degraded communication. With this point of view, Team DRC-Hubo@UNLV integrated methods and algorithms previously verified, validated, and widely used in the robotics community. For the communication aspect, a common shared memory approach that the team adopted to enable efficient data communication under the DARPA controlled network is described. A new perception head design (optimized for the tasks of the Finals) and its data processing are then presented. In the motion planning and control aspect, various techniques, such as wheel-driven navigation, zero-moment-point (ZMP) -based locomotion, and position-based manipulation and controls, are described in this paper. By introducing strategically critical elements and key lessons learned from DRC-Trials 2013 and the testbed of Charleston, we also illustrate how DRC-Hubo has evolved successfully toward the DRC-Finals.

They are proliferating rapidly and represent an alternative to mass production and consumption, an ideology whose environmental and social benefits their \"makers\" like to espouse. A longitudinal ethnographic study in a Fab Lab in a European design school examined the Lab's ideology building, how ideals were enacted and where compromises were visible. Environmental issues were intertwined with other ideological concerns, but they were rarely promoted in their own right. Engagement with sustainability-oriented makers and stakeholders is recommended.","727":"Traditionally, most irrigation practices in Southern Europe have been based on gravity-fed surface irrigation systems. Currently, these systems remain a relevant typology in the European Union (EU) member states of the Mediterranean areas, where it is often the only sustainable method for farmers due to the small size of agricultural holdings, their reduced capacity and readiness to invest and the low ratio between yield profits and irrigation costs. In the last several years, in response to European and national directives, surface irrigation has garnered increasing attention at the political and bureaucratic levels due to frequent criticisms of its postulated low efficiency and high water wastage. However, these systems commonly provide a number of ecosystem services and nature-based solutions that increase the positive externalities in different rural socio-ecological contexts and often have the potential to extend these services and provide solutions that are compatible with economical sustainability. This study aims to discuss the prospects for new practices and for the rehabilitation and modernization of the gravity-fed surface irrigation systems in EU Mediterranean areas to enhance water efficiency, thus gaining both economic advantages and environmental benefits. The difficulties, stimuli for improvements and peculiarities of the irrigation water management of four rural environments located in Italy, Spain and Portugal were analyzed and compared to the current state of the gravity-fed surface irrigation systems with hypothetical future improvements achievable by innovative technologies and practices. In these different case studies, the current gravity-fed surface irrigation systems have an obsolete regulatory structure; water-use efficiency is not a driving criterion for the management of the conveyance and distribution canal network, and farmers are not yet adequately encouraged to adopt more efficient gravity-fed irrigation practices. A continuous knowledge exchange is thus necessary for the interaction of all irrigation water managers and farmers to improve their eco-efficiency and to preserve and promote their cultural heritage across the entire water supply and delivery chains. We argue that the best way forward will require precisely targeted rehabilitation measures of gravity-fed surface irrigation systems based on the integrated use of decision support services, gate automation, remote and feedback controls and real-time flow optimization.","728":"The current standard protocols for characterizing the optogenetic circuit of bacterial cells using flow cytometry in light tubes and light exposure of culture plates are tedious, labor-intensive, and cumbersome. In this work, we engineer a bioreactor with working volume of similar to 10 mL for in vivo real-time optogenetic characterization of E. coli with a CcaS-CcaR light-sensing system. In the bioreactor, optical density measurements, reporter protein fluorescence detection, and light input stimuli are provided by four light-emitting diode sources and two photodetectors. Once calibrated, the device can cultivate microbial cells and record their growth and gene expression without human intervention. We measure gene expression during cell growth with different organic substrates (glucose, succinate, acetate, pyruvate) as carbon sources in minimal medium and the optogenetic circuit by serial dilution passages. demonstrate evolutionary tuning of the optogenetic circuit by serial dilution passages.","729":"This paper presents an analysis of data collected through the Waterloo WeBike project: a field trial in which over 30 sensor-equipped electric bicycles (e-bikes) were given to members of the University of Waterloo for personal use. Our dataset includes e-bike trips and battery charging sessions spanning nearly three years, from summer 2014 until spring 2017. We also conducted three surveys both before and during the trial. Our main findings were that the primary purpose of the e-bikes in our trial was for commuting, with most trips lasting less than 20 minutes and most trips taking place in the summer months. Our battery charging analysis revealed no evidence of range anxiety, and our analysis of survey results showed little correlation between anticipated and actual use. Furthermore, when asked about their opinions about various modes of transportation, our participants rated regular bicycles higher than e-bikes even after becoming familiar with e-bikes through the field trial. Based on our analysis, we draw several conclusions, including the fact that the general population in Canada is still unaware of e-bikes and their potential. Moreover, e-bike manufacturers should target sales to nonbike users, such as seniors, rather than trying to displace sales of regular bicycles.","730":"Implantable neuronal interfaces to the brain are an important keystone for future medical applications. However, entering this field of research is difficult since such an implant requires components from many different areas of technology. Since the complete avoidance of wires is important due to the risk of infections and other long-term problems, means for wirelessly transmitting data and energy are a necessity which adds to the requirements. In recent literature, many high-tech components for such implants are presented with remarkable properties. However, these components are typically not freely available for such a system. Every group needs to re-develop their own solution. This raises the question if it is possible to create a reusable design for an implant and its external base-station, such that it allows other groups to use it as a starting point. In this article, we try to answer this question by presenting a design based exclusively on commercial off-the-shelf components and studying the properties of the resulting system. Following this idea, we present a fully wireless neuronal implant for simultaneously measuring electrocorticography signals at 128 locations from the surface of the brain. All design files are available as open source.","731":"This chapter discusses the practices of silicon luthiers, the master craftspeople of electronic music.

Musicians and designers have always questioned the limits of their devices, as well as the preconceptions of what instruments could or should be: Through the development of original interfaces and unusual synthesis methods, they offered their personal visions for the field. This chapter offers a view of how these innovators helped shape the present and many futures of music technology.","732":"Tilt-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles have attracted increasing attention due to their ability to perform vertical take-off and landing and their high-speed cruising abilities, thereby presenting broad application prospects. Considering portability and applications in tasks characterized by constrained or small scope areas, this article presents a compact tricopter configuration tilt-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle with full modes of flight from the rotor mode to the fixed-wing mode and vice versa. The unique multiple modes make the tilt-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle a multi-input multi-output, non-affine, multi-channel cross coupling, and nonlinear system. Considering these characteristics, a control allocation method is designed to make the controller adaptive to the full modes of flight. To reduce the cost, the accurate dynamic model of the tilt-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle is not obtained, so a full-mode flight strategy is designed in view of this situation. An autonomous flight test was conducted, and the results indicate the satisfactory performance of the control allocation method and flight strategy.","733":"White or polychromatic light sources are vastly abundant in nature and lie in our most basic understanding of the theory of light, beginning from stars like our Sun and extending to every common household light bulb or street lamp.

The benefits of a flipped classroom include increased student motivation, differentiating instruction, self-pacing lessons and mastery learning, increased collaboration and instant feedback for formative assessment. Although limited research has been conducted regarding students with learning difficulties in inclusive settings using a flipped learning model, initial research indicates flipping a classroom can be beneficial.

The proposed method is based on Bluetooth transfer technology and mesh networking to provide automatic connections between network machines and on a Docker flat form, which is a container virtualization technology for setting and managing key functions. Additionally, the system includes a clustering and recovery measure regarding network function based on the Docker platform.

The principles of non-formal education aligned with the concept of constructionism are used to create an experimental educational scenario focused on geocultural tourism for persons with visual impairments. This paper documents our experience and presents our findings- from a 25-day long project, which took place in Zagori, northwestern Greece. 11 high school students from Portugal designed and manufactured natural and cultural heritage artifacts carrying messages in the Braille language. The objects were then handed to people with visual impairments with a twofold aim. First, to enable the communication among persons with and without visual impairments; and, second, to empower students to participate in training projects through open educational procedures. We conclude that open educational practices can boost students' active engagement in educational processes. Finally, 3D printing encourages a meaningful communication among people with and without visual impairments via the tangible exploration of geocultural components. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In the Brighton trial, three-quarters of those who were loaned an e-bike used them at least once a week. Across the sample as a whole, average usage was in the order of 1520 miles per week, and was accompanied by an overall reduction in car mileage of 20%. At the end of the trial, 38% participants expected to cycle more in the future, and at least 70% said that they would like to have an e-bike available for use in the future, and would cycle more if this was the case. This is consistent with the results of the European literature which shows that when e-bikes are made available, they get used; that a proportion of e-bike trips typically substitutes for car use; and that many people who take part in trials become interested in future e-bike use, or cycling more generally.

However, in agriculture fields the temperature significantly changes from time to time during 24 h, which affects response of the soil moisture sensor. This paper, analyzes and models the error produced in the response of the DPHP sensors due to variation of the soil temperature. For this purpose, first effect of the soil temperature on the response of the sensor is studied using eight different soil samples. Accordingly, the existing soil moisture model, used for DPHP devices, is modified and used for the temperature compensation. A low power DPHP sensor comprising one heater probe and one temperature sensor probe, placed 0.003 m apart, is fabricated. A low power, automated system, dissipating average power of 30 mW, is also developed for the field measurements to validate the proposed model. The developed system is deployed in the field and soil moisture is measured for 38 h at every 1 h interval. Field measurements indicates that volumetric moisture content measured without temperature compensation leads to error of about 3% and with temperature compensation the error is reduced to 0.5%.

GTPases, responding to signals generated by abiotic stressors, nutrients, and, in metazoans, growth factors, play an important(3) but poorly understood role in TORC1 regulation. Here we report that, in budding yeast, glucose withdrawal (which leads to an acute loss of TORC1 kinase activity(4)) triggers a similarly rapid Rag GTPase-dependent redistribution of TORC1 from being semi-uniform around the vacuolar membrane to a single, vacuole-associated cylindrical structure visible by super-resolution optical microscopy. Three-dimensional reconstructions of cryo-electron micrograph images of these purified cylinders demonstrate that TORC1 oligomerizes into a higher-level hollow helical assembly, which we name a TOROID (TORC1 organized in inhibited domain). Fitting of the recently described mammalian TORC1 structure into our helical map reveals that oligomerization leads to steric occlusion of the active site. Guided by the implications from our reconstruction, we present a TOR1 allele that prevents both TOROID formation and TORC1 inactivation in response to glucose withdrawal, demonstrating that oligomerization is necessary for TORC1 inactivation. Our results reveal a novel mechanism by which Rag GTPases regulate TORC1 activity and suggest that the reversible assembly and\/or disassembly of higher-level structures may be an underappreciated mechanism for the regulation of protein kinases.","750":"This article contends that technopopulism is a discursive formation that emerges from the convergence of two preexisting discourses: populism and technolibertarianism. Whereas these discourses are historically distinct the 2008 financial crisis and the 2011 wave of struggles precipitated the political conditions for their intersection. Such convergence produces both tensions and possibilities. On the one hand, technopopulism engenders a radically participatory model of democracy, which is ultimately anti-institutional as citizens cooperate and engage in sophisticated decision-making without the mediation of professional politicians. On the other hand, the more electorally successful technopopulist parties are led by charismatic leaders who synthesize the positions that emerge from the netroots to mobilize them against the establishment. These two seemingly contradictory aspects precipitate in two variants of technopopulism: a leaderless-technocratic variant, which is derived from the open source mode of governance and from early experiments of the Global Justice Movement in networked self-government; and a leaderist-populist variant, which is more strictly focused on the electoral competition as an intrinsically hegemonic practice. The article concludes with a reflection on the discursive complementarity of these two variants.","751":"Characterizing dementia is a global challenge in supporting personalized health care. The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a promising tool to support the diagnosis and evaluation of abnormalities in the human brain. The EEG sensors record the brain activity directly with excellent time resolution. In this study, EEG sensor with 19 electrodes were used to test the background activities of the brains of five vascular dementia (VaD), 15 stroke-related patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 15 healthy subjects during a working memory (WM) task. The objective of this study is twofold. First, it aims to enhance the recorded EEG signals using a novel technique that combines automatic independent component analysis (AICA) and wavelet transform (WT), that is, the AICA-WT technique; second, it aims to extract and investigate the spectral features that characterize the post-stroke dementia patients compared to the control subjects. The proposed AICA-WT technique is a four-stage approach. In the first stage, the independent components (ICs) were estimated. In the second stage, three-step artifact identification metrics were applied to detect the artifactual components. The components identified as artifacts were marked as critical and denoised through DWT in the third stage. In the fourth stage, the corrected ICs were reconstructed to obtain artifact-free EEG signals. The performance of the proposed AICA-WT technique was compared with those of two other techniques based on AICA andWT denoising methods using cross-correlation XCorr and peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) (ANOVA, p < 0.05). The AICA-WT technique exhibited the best artifact removal performance. The assumption that there would be a deceleration of EEG dominant frequencies in VaD and MCI patients compared with control subjects was assessed with AICA-WT (ANOVA, p < 0.05). Therefore, this study may provide information on post-stroke dementia particularly VaD and stroke-related MCI patients through spectral analysis of EEG background activities that can help to provide
