AB  - In this research, a full rehabilitation study (retrofit) of an isolated villa in a Mediterranean climate was carried out in order to show how a retrofit of a building with a combination of simple passive and active strategies can improve the sustainability, energy efficiency and the thermal comfort. This is performed thanks to the design of a methodology of using a thermal simulation tool with experimental measurements based on a low-cost open source hardware platform in order to evaluate the energy saving measures and analyse the thermal comfort and energy savings. To accomplish this, a study of the housing needs is performed a priori to later design the different actions in the rehabilitation, using if possible, ecological materials in its development. Basically, walls and ceilings are insulated, three solar air collectors are included to heat the air ventilation and decrease the heating demand, and two pellet stoves are installed. Finally, the refurbished house is modeled and simulated in EnergyPlus and compared with the indoor air temperature and relative humidity measurements, made using an Open-Source Monitoring System (OSMS) developed for this research in Arduino, obtaining results with no significant differences without the need to calibrate the system. The results of thermal comfort, heating and cooling demand and heating energy consumption of the house before and after the renovation are compared providing a decrease in thermal demand of 66% and a decrease in heating energy consumption of 50% in the winter season, where 60% of the energy consumed is contributed from renewable sources. In terms of thermal comfort, the comparison of the PPD and PMV values shows an improvement in the house in heating and cooling season. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Air pollution is a serious problem and has caused public health concerns all over the world. Despite the evidence, the preparedness and response of citizens has been limited. This underlines the importance of having sustainable air quality monitoring solutions that foster inclusion and multi-stakeholder partnerships for social-scientific interventions. This study illustrates how AirBox project has emerged in Taiwan, where makers and citizens use the sensors to sense air quality and provide the public with actionable data about their environments. The AirBox project includes elements of technology-innovation and citizen science: (1) Participatory Sensing – Static and mobile air quality sensing, (2) Open Data – Open hardware, software and access to data, (3) Co-creation Citizen Science – Citizen-led campaigns and forums, and (4) Outreach – Knowledge sharing, trust building and multi-stakeholder collaboration. The project uses a wide range of sensors to provide extendable solutions and data at fine spatio-temporal resolution. The results are highlighted using five cases studies that show how integrating social dimensions in an air quality monitoring framework can lead to public awareness, data-driven applications and environmentally sustainable cities. The multi-faceted approach highlights the effects of a bottom-up citizen science approach that considers local culture, practices and problems at grassroots. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work, an omnidirectional sensor that enables identification of the direction of the celestial sphere with maximum solar irradiance is presented. The sensor, based on instantaneous measurements, functions as a position server for dual‐axis solar trackers in photovoltaic plants. The proposed device has been developed with free software and hardware, which makes it a pioneering solution because it is open and accessible as well as capable of being improved by the scientific community, thereby contributing to the rapid advancement of technology. In addition, the device includes an algorithm developed ex professo that makes it possible to predetermine the regions of the celestial sphere for which, according to the geometric characteristics of the PV plant, there would be shading between the panels. In this way, solar trackers do not have to locate the Sun’s position at all times according to astronomical models, while taking into account factors such as shadows or cloudiness that also affect levels of incident irradiance on solar collectors. Therefore, with this device, it is possible to provide photovoltaic plants with dual‐axis solar tracking with a low‐cost device that helps to optimise the trajectory of the trackers and, consequently, their radiative capture and energy production. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: The usage of open-source hardware (OSH) designs has been put forward as a means to mitigate the shortage of core medical equipment, such as ventilators and of personal protection equipment (PPE) in medical facilities worldwide, resulting from the ever increasing number of individuals affect by COVID-19. This is due to the model allowing for the lowering of costs and widespread distribution of manufacturing. On the other hand, low adherence to its best practices and insufficient development may jeopardize OSH as a viable aid against the pandemic. In this work, we sought to clarify to what extent publicly available designs of ventilator and PPE are developed and abide by OSH standards as measure of the true openness of the solutions. Methods: We searched the Internet and the literature to compile a comprehensive list of ventilators and PPE, while assessing available documentation in order to objectively evaluate key development landmarks (e.g., testing and governmental clearance) and indicators of adherence by OSH standards, as described by the Open Source Hardware Association. Results: Only a few peer-reviewed articles have been found, while a good number of Internet entries of open ventilator and PPE designs were found. Available documentation varied a lot in quantity and quality. Overall, adherence to OSH best practices and level of development were only partially fulfilled. Conclusions: Although this suboptimal performance regarding openness of designs may limit the benefits of the model, data suggests that present open-source efforts are highly beneficial and that they will be able to completely fulfill their mission given more and better OSH is carried out. © 2021, Sociedade Brasileira de Engenharia Biomedica.

AB  - Hardware-planted bugs is a major security concern in today’s Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Security testing of a hardware chip that integrates a computation and communication module together is complex, even though the software would only be few lines of code. In such a device, conventional software testing approaches such as code walk-throughs and reviews can be used for detecting security vulnerabilities. However, testing hardware security in such integrated IoT devices is a challenge. In this paper, we use the open-source hardware SHAKTI E-Class as the computation element. Since the hardware design and code are available, security test of computation part can be performed independently of the communication part. For the communication part, we externally integrate the widely used commercial ESP8266 Wireless LAN (WLAN) module through the Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART) with SHAKTI E-class. This ESP8266 WLAN chip can be security tested separately. Finally, security testing of the computation and communication interface can be performed. This leads to a modular security testing approach that could be of immense importance in strategic sectors. This is a first successful attempt to increase the security of IoT devices using the SHAKTI E-class open-source processors. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents the development and fabrication of an open source, do-it-yourself underwater drone called DugongBot, which is developed in collaboration with the Underwater Technology Research Group (UTeRG), Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka. Research institutes and hobbyist have shown a growing interest in the development of micro observation class remotely operated vehicle (micro-ROV) using open-source platform. Currently, OpenROV and Ardusub are the low-cost open-source solutions that are available for such ROVs. The open-source hardware and software platforms are being used worldwide for the development of small range of electrical powered ROV system’s architecture, with support from the literature in the internet and the extensive experience acquired with the development of robotic exploration systems. This paper presents the development of DugongBot, which uses the OpenROV open-source platform. Weighing approximately 3 kg and designed for 100 m depth, the drone uses a single 18 cm long watertight tube in 10 cm diameter to accommodate the main electronics compartment, which can be tilted up and down with a servo, for CMOS sensor HD webcam alignment. Two horizontal thrusters for forward, reverse and rotational movement and a vertical thruster for depth control is also used for manoeuvrability. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2021.

AB  - This paper aims to develop a low-cost stroboscope, which consists of an optical equipment capable of generating flashes of light at different frequencies, allowing to measure the rotation velocity of machines and contributing to maintenance processes in the industry. This device is based on the stroboscopic effect, a visual event that occurs when a continuous movement is presented by a series of samples, generated by flashes of light. When the frequency of the rotation movement is the same frequency of light pulses, the process will appear stationary. Based on the high cost of the commercial stroboscopes, it was developed a stroboscope prototype based on the Arduino platform, LED technology and 3D printing with an open hardware and software. The final prototype went through calibration and validation processes, achieving a performance very similar to a commercial instrument. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

AB  - Research activities in Antarctica face a number of risk factors, such as cold, strong winds, and isolated or dangerous environments. Among them, crevasses, which are deep cracks in glaciers, can cause fatal accidents since they are difficult to locate as they are covered with snow. In this paper, we present the development, design, and deployment of an UGV (Unmanned Ground Vehicle) that can explore ice-sheets and be used in various polar research fields. The developed UGV was customized to remotely detect crevasses and prevent related accidents. In order to adapt to the harsh terrain of Antarctica, the vehicle features ground clearance over 260 mm, four-wheel-drive ability with a 400W high-power motor, as well as passive joints and differential links to allow for four-point contact on rough terrain. The UGV is also designed to run for more than two hours on the Antarctic ice sheet at a speed of 2.5 m/sec. The control unit uses open-source hardware and software for rapid function implementation and ease of future customization. In November 2019, the UGV detected crevasses successfully by towing an IPR (Ice Penetrating Radar) along the 2.6 km section of the Browning Pass around Jang Bogo Station, Antarctica. Further improvement is required for heading angle errors due to magnetic compass malfunctions in Antarctica, and for the vibration and misalignment of the traction device for the towing research equipment. © ICROS 2021.

AB  - eChronos is a formally verified real-time operating system (RTOS) designed for embedded microcontrollers. eChronos was targeted for tightly constrained devices without memory management units. Currently, eChronos is available on proprietary designs like ARM, PowerPC, and Intel architectures. eChronos is adopted in safety critical systems like aircraft control system and medical implant devices. eChronos is one of the very few system softwares not been ported to RISC-V. RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) that enables a new era of processor development. Many standard operating systems, software toolchain has migrated to the RISC-V architecture. According to the latest trends [1], RISC-V is replacing many proprietary chips. As a secure RTOS, it is attractive to port on an open-source ISA. SHAKTI and PicoRV32 are some of the proven open-source RISC-V designs available. Now having a secure RTOS on an open-source hardware design, designed based on an open-source ISA makes it more interesting. In addition to this, the current architectures supported by eChronos are all proprietary designs [2], and porting eChronos to the RISC-V architecture increases the secure system development as a whole. This paper presents an idea of porting eChronos on a chip which is open-source and effective, thus reducing the cost of embedded systems. Designing a open-source system that is completely open-source reduces the overall cost, increased the security, and can be critically reviewed. This paper explores the design and architecture aspect involved in porting eChronos to RISC-V. The authors have successfully ported eChronos to RISC-V architecture and verified it on spike [3]. The port of RISC-V to eChronos is made available open-source by authors [4]. Along with that, the safe removal of architectural dependencies and subsequent changes in eChronos is also analyzed. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Radio frequency identification (RFID) technology, performs the self- identification of cards or tags that store a unique identification code; this information is obtained wirelessly by a special reader. This type of technology in recent years has been adopted more frequently in both the industrial and domestic sectors due to its low cost and benefits compared to other similar technologies. The implementation of control systems with this technology generates great benefits such as increased security, generation of assistance reports and automatic access blocking. In this work a study of RFID technology is carried out exploring its main advantages and disadvantages compared to other self-identification technologies available in the market; Based on this study, an access control system with configurable, time-scalable, secure and low-cost RFID technology with free hardware and software for the Instituto Superior Tecnológico Eloy Alfaro (ISTEA) was created. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Contribution: While research indicates usefulness of remote laboratories in teaching of digital hardware systems, their main application is to complement stationary classes. This work presents a low-cost, scalable architecture that supports rapid transformation of teaching to a model based solely on remote access mechanisms. Background: Adaptation of online laboratory solutions from the literature to en-masse teaching of digital circuits is time-consuming and expensive. Solutions that permit cheap and rapid conversion of courses to remote environments seem to be of high value, especially when social distancing renders direct teaching impossible. Intended Outcomes: Demonstration of a flexible and cheap architecture that permits rapid transformation of digital circuits laboratories to the remote environment. Validation of system's performance and usefulness on a large group of students. Application Design: Remote digital circuits laboratories from the literature are designed to complement stationary classes. For successful teaching during pandemic, a low-cost, flexible, and efficient solution to online laboratory based on commonly available technologies is required. Findings: The proposed remote laboratory architecture enables rapid conversion of on-site teaching to online model, while supporting in-situ upgrades and functionality enhancements. The presented solution proved to be a convenient substitute for conventional laboratories during pandemic. IEEE

AB  - In his book Tools for Conviviality (1975), Ivan Illich calls for human self-limitation in technology development. His aim is neither environmental protection nor the prevention of unforeseen side-effects of technology development, but the comprehensibility of technologies' operating principles for the user. For if the construction or repairing of tools requires expert knowledge inaccessible to the public, this necessarily entails social imbalances in power. In a similar manner, Bernard Stiegler conceives the delegation of know-how to technological systems as a kind of proletarianization that ultimately may result in a loss of savoir-vivre. Without sweepingly rejecting the division of labour, automation or specialized knowledge, practices of commoning respond to such diagnoses: free software like GNU/Linux or open hardware largely succeed in unlinking the expert knowledge that advanced computing doubtlessly requires from problematic power effects. From this perspective, proprietary algorithms are problematic, as their lack of transparency prevents conviviality. This also holds for the practices of data aggregation and extraction which steadily increase the information gap between platform providers and users. An even more fundamental problem is posed by so-called "self-learning", i.e., recursively adapting, algorithms: it is not clear how and to what extent the knowledge and instructions generated by "artificial intelligence"can be traced and reconstructed by human insight. Thus, we are confronted with a situation of potentially non-recoverable proletarianization and non-conviviality that exposes a renewed urgency of Illich's considerations concerning technological self-limitation. © 2020 Andreas Beinsteiner, published by De Gruyter 2020.

AB  - In the current industrialized food production network, most food suppliers rely on large, mono-crop farms that grow massive amounts of a single product and ship it around the globe. Food may travel thousands of miles over the course of days, weeks, or even months before it reaches our tables. Not only is this system strain on the environment, and on the cost to the consumer, but it also affects the quality of the food we put in our bodies. The objective of this project is to design and develop a smart incubator grow system for plants by developing the open source hardware and software platforms for sensor-controlled hydroponic and aeroponic agriculture systems. Inside of this smart incubator, climate variables such as carbon dioxide, air temperature, humidity, dissolved oxygen, potential hydrogen, electrical conductivity, root-zone temperature, and more can be controlled and monitored. Usage specifications such as operational energy, water use, and mineral consumption can also be monitored and adjusted through electrical meters, flow sensors, and controllable chemical doses throughout the growth period. The complete set of conditions throughout a growth cycle produces unique phenotypic expressions, or physical qualities in different plants. Plants grown under different conditions may vary in colour, size, texture, growth rate, yield, flavour, and nutrient density. The system can be monitor and control through wireless connectivity technology © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Blessing with fresh air to breathe is one of the primary living requirements of the Human being. Nowadays, majority of the countries in the world are suffering from the problem of Air pollution. This problem is getting worse day by day because of rapid economic growth, industrialization, urbanization and the resulting rise in energy demand. Air pollution has been become one of the primary concern in Sri Lanka. In most of the Sri Lankan cities, the primary cause for the air pollution is the lack of the prevalence of proper environmental regulations. Although the scientific evaluation of such technologies and systems is generally recognized as a significant facet of open source technologies and their implementation, it is often underexplored in science. This research provides an integrated approach to the development of an Environmental Monitoring System prototype based on open source hardware and software and to track the reliability of the system in terms of data accuracy. This system is able to measure six environmental parameters namely air temperature, air CO Percentage, air NO2 percentage, air O3 percentage, air PM percentage and air SO2 percentage. This research has shown a promising way to create a dense coverage for more cost-effective monitoring of environmental phenomena. Most of the existing monitoring systems for air pollution have inferior accuracy, low sensitivity and require laboratory study. Our implemented system is a three-phase air pollution monitoring system, which have drastically shown improvements over the existing methodologies combining with the Internet of Things (IOT). © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Single-molecule Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) is a powerful technique capable of resolving both relative and absolute distances within and between structurally dynamic biomolecules. High instrument costs, and a lack of open-source hardware and acquisition software have limited smFRET’s broad application by non-specialists. Here, we present the smfBox, a cost-effective confocal smFRET platform, providing detailed build instructions, open-source acquisition software, and full validation, thereby democratising smFRET for the wider scientific community. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: To implement a modular, flexible, open-source hardware configuration for parallel transmission (pTx) experiments on medical implant safety and to demonstrate real-time mitigation strategies for radio frequency (RF) induced implant heating based on sensor measurements. Methods: The hardware comprises a home-built 8-channel pTx system (scalable to 32-channels), wideband power amplifiers and a positioning system with submillimeter precision. The orthogonal projection (OP) method is used to mitigate RF induced tip heating and to maintain sufficient (Formula presented.) for imaging. Experiments are performed at 297MHz and inside a clinical 3T MRI using 8-channel pTx RF coils, a guidewire substitute inside a phantom with attached thermistor and time-domain E-field probes. Results: Repeatability and precision are ~3% for E-field measurements including guidewire repositioning, ~3% for temperature slopes and an ~6% root-mean-square deviation between (Formula presented.) measurements and simulations. Real-time pTx mitigation with the OP mode reduces the E-fields everywhere within the investigated area with a maximum reduction factor of 26 compared to the circularly polarized mode. Tip heating was measured with ~100 μK resolution and ~14 Hz sampling frequency and showed substantial reduction for the OP vs CP mode. Conclusion: The pTx medical implant safety testbed presents a much-needed flexible and modular hardware configuration for the in-vitro assessment of implant safety, covering all field strengths from 0.5-7 T. Sensor based real-time mitigation strategies utilizing pTx and the OP method allow to substantially reduce RF induced implant heating while maintaining sufficient image quality without the need for a priori knowledge based on simulations or in-vitro testing. © 2020 physikalisch-technische bundesanstalt.

AB  - The FloripaSat-I project consists of an initiative from the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC), in Brazil, to train students to design, test and integrate innovative space systems. The group just developed its first open-source CubeSat, the FloripaSat-I, which aims to empower students to develop space systems through a practical approach, where they have full control of the design and test of a real spacecraft. The project has already gone through all the stages of a CubeSat mission prior to the launching and operation stages. A prototype of the satellite, as well the engineering models 1 and 2 (EM-I and EM-II) were built. The expertise provided by the engineering models allows the development of a functional flight model (FM). This paper presents the validation and qualification tests that pass various FloripaSat-I models, from the engineering model to the flight model. All stages of the project are described, the tests performed in each phase, as well as the lessons learned. Thus, this paper serves as a guidance for other university teams that want to test their own CubeSats, as well as teams that want to use the open-source hardware and software left as heritage by this project. © 1990-2011 Beijing Institute of Aerospace Information.

AB  - Although the cure for the SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) will come in the form of pharmaceutical solutions and/or a vaccine, one of the only ways to face it at present is to guarantee the best quality of health for patients, so that they can overcome the disease on their own. Therefore, and considering that COVID-19 generally causes damage to the respiratory system (in the form of lung infection), it is essential to ensure the best pulmonary ventilation for the patient. However, depending on the severity of the disease and the health condition of the patient, the situation can become critical when the patient has respiratory distress or becomes unable to breathe on his/her own. In that case, the ventilator becomes the lifeline of the patient. This device must keep patients stable until, on their own or with the help of medications, they manage to overcome the lung infection. However, with thousands or hundreds of thousands of infected patients, no country has enough ventilators. If this situation has become critical in the Global North, it has turned disastrous in developing countries, where ventilators are even more scarce. This article shows the race against time of a multidisciplinary research team at the University of Huelva, UHU, southwest of Spain, to develop an inexpensive, multifunctional, and easy-to-manufacture ventilator, which has been named ResUHUrge. The device meets all medical requirements and is developed with open-source hardware and software. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Affordable and readily available microelectronics are becoming prevalent in teaching laboratories however these useful and economic tools are not used widely in either academia or industry. Herein we report how a metal organic framework (MOF) synthetic route can be optimized using an in situ monitoring apparatus designed in-house on open source hardware for under $100. We demonstrate that the MOF can be produced at atmospheric pressure, an improvement over previous reports, but also with a reduction in reaction time of 93%. This improvement in reaction time was predicted after a single experiment using the monitoring kit showing how efficiencies in the lab can be gained with very little experimental and monetary overhead while minimising the resources used. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - A CE instrument that can be assembled from commercially available components with minimal construction effort is described. Except for the electronic control circuitry no specially made parts are required. It is based on a flexible design of microfluidic, electropneumatic, and electronic sections and different configurations can easily be implemented. Automated injection into the capillary is performed hydrodynamically by the application of a pressure for a controlled length of time. The performance of the device was tested with a contactless conductivity detector by separating different metal ions. In addition, nine metal cations related to the quality of honey were separated in 2.3 min and four honey samples were analysed quantitatively to demonstrate the applicability of the method. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - Inadequate weather conditions are one of the main threats to the correct development of sensitive crops, where a bad situation can lead to greater stress on plants and their weakness against various diseases. This statement is especially decisive in the cultivation of the vineyard. Meteorological monitoring of vineyard parcels is vital to detect and prevent possible fungal diseases. The development of new Information and Communication Technologies, linked to the Smart Farming movement, together with the reduced cost of electronic components, have favoured a greater availability of meteorological monitoring stations to get to know first-class hand the state of the vineyard smallholdings. This work provides a set of over 750,000 environmental raw data records collected by low-cost Internet of Things nodes, primarily located within vineyard smallholdings. The published observations were collected between 2018-04-01 and 2018-10-31 and were validated in previous research to determine the data's reliability. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - We describe a high resolution laser polarimeter built from commodity optical components. The optical rotation angle is determined by measuring the phase difference between two harmonically modulated polarised laser beams – an ‘object beam’ that passes through the sample under test and a ‘reference beam’ that bypasses the sample. The complete polarimeter may be assembled from low cost off-the-shelf parts for less than £300 (UK Sterling). Data acquisition and analysis are carried out on a microcontroller running an efficient algorithm based on the sliding Discrete Fourier Transform. Despite its low cost, the polarimeter is a fully automatic, research-grade instrument with an accuracy of ±0.0013° and a precision of ±0.0028° – comparable to far costlier commercial instruments. The polarimeter’s ease of use, compact size, fast measurement times and high angular resolution make it a capable and versatile tool for analytical science, while its low cost means it is ideally suited for use in resource-constrained environments and process monitoring. The polarimeter is released here as open hardware, with technical diagrams, a full parts list, and source code for its firmware included as Supplementary Information. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - New innovations in single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) have revolutionized optical imaging, enabling the characterization of biological structures and interactions with unprecedented detail and resolution. However, multi-color or hyperspectral SMLM can pose particular challenges which affect image quality and data interpretation, such as unequal photophysical performance of fluorophores and non-linear image registration issues, which arise as two emission channels travel along different optical paths to reach the detector. In addition, using evanescent-wave based approaches (Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence: TIRF) where beam shape, decay depth, and power density are important, different illumination wavelengths can lead to unequal imaging depth across multiple channels on the same sample. A potential useful approach would be to use a single excitation wavelength to perform hyperspectral localization imaging. We report herein on the use of a variable angle tunable thin-film filter to spectrally isolate far-red emitting fluorophores. This solution was integrated into a commercial microscope platform using an open-source hardware design, enabling the rapid acquisition of SMLM images arising from fluorescence emission captured within ∼15 nm to 20 nm spectral windows (or detection bands). By characterizing intensity distributions, average intensities, and localization frequency through a range of spectral windows, we investigated several far-red emitting fluorophores and identified an optimal fluorophore pair for two-color SMLM using this method. Fluorophore crosstalk between the different spectral windows was assessed by examining the effect of varying the photon output thresholds on the localization frequency and fraction of data recovered. The utility of this approach was demonstrated by hyper-spectral super-resolution imaging of the interaction between the mitochondrial protein, TOM20, and the peroxisomal protein, PMP70. © 2020 Author(s).

AB  - Although the cure for the SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) will come in the form of pharmaceutical solutions and/or a vaccine, one of the only ways to face it at present is to guarantee the best quality of health for patients, so that they can overcome the disease on their own. Therefore, and considering that COVID-19 generally causes damage to the respiratory system (in the form of lung infection), it is essential to ensure the best pulmonary ventilation for the patient. However, depending on the severity of the disease and the health condition of the patient, the situation can become critical when the patient has respiratory distress or becomes unable to breathe on his/her own. In that case, the ventilator becomes the lifeline of the patient. This device must keep patients stable until, on their own or with the help of medications, they manage to overcome the lung infection. However, with thousands or hundreds of thousands of infected patients, no country has enough ventilators. If this situation has become critical in the Global North, it has turned disastrous in developing countries, where ventilators are even more scarce. This article shows the race against time of a multidisciplinary research team at the University of Huelva, UHU, southwest of Spain, to develop an inexpensive, multifunctional, and easy-to-manufacture ventilator, which has been named ResUHUrge. The device meets all medical requirements and is developed with open-source hardware and software.

AB  - Front-end designs of OS-powered SoCs are developed to be implemented on SRAM-based FPGAs, which can be used in low-cost space applications. In this work, we evaluate the impact of OS on the reliability of a RISC-V based SoC, against configuration memory upsets. The results show that these upsets in the presence of OS barely affect the number of silent data corruptions, whereas the single event functional interruption rate increases about 3.6 times as compared to the bare-metal program execution. We also conclude that single event functional interruption rate due to configuration memory upsets show less dependence on the user application workload as compared to silent data corruption rates. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper, a simulation model and practical testbed for green Internet of Things (IoT) edge devices are proposed based on solar harvester with constant voltage-maximum power point tracking (CV-MPPT) technique. Billions of connected edge devices represent the essential part of the IoT through the IP-enabled sensor networks based on IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN). In traditional IoT edge devices, the stored energy in the non-rechargeable battery determines the node lifetime while it is being depleted with time. Therefore, purchasing billions of such batteries is costly and must be disposed of efficiently. This paper is aimed at simulating and implementing a new class of green IoT edge devices that can report data wirelessly and powered perpetually using clean energy. The developed edge device utilizes solar energy harvesting mechanism through photovoltaic (PV) module, this approach will avoid periodical battery replacement and hence, the energy supplied to the sensor mode is not limited anymore. The implemented testbed is based on open-source hardware and software platforms while the simulation environment is based on MATLAB/SIMULINK 2019a. The effects of temperature and solar irradiance on the performance of the developed approach are examined in order to confirm the leverage of the proposed methodology scheme. The lifetime of the developed green IoT device is predicted based on the device's activities, current consumption, and energy storage capacity. The obtained results showed that the battery lifetime is extended by 38-49% when the edge device runs on an independent power source. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Physical activity should become an everyday goal. Portable systems are a perfect complement to follow-up exercise adaptation. This work presents the simultaneous measurements of surface electromyography (sEMG) and electrocardiography (ECG) signals acquisition using the BiTalino kit during joint flexion/extension and ergometry in sports evaluations. sEMG signals show the antagonist muscles and their contributions between limbs during movement performance the analysis of heart rate changes and the tachogram calculation sum up to a set of tests to understand how the heart adjust to a demand and how it recovers. Signal processing used discrete and continuous wavelet transforms, to take advantage of time resolution for event characterization in the presence of artifacts due to movement the use of the open source hardware BiTalino kit, along to a robust digital signal processing, allows to implement tools as an auxiliary of dynamic sports evaluations. This type of test is not normally used, so the development of this tool can potentially analyze fitness performance, fatigue, and antagonist muscles imbalances to adjust training and prevent injuries. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - This article aims to present and analyse a model for a Educational Robotics teacher training course for public brazilian schools teachers. The use of technologies in the classroom has become common in many schools over the world and robotics is an example of these technologies, changing this educational environment that for long remained still. However, the Education professionals don't have the appropriate skills due the fact that such technologies aren't presented during their academic education. Due to this shortfall in such technologies and a great interest shown from education professionals, the project URA (One Robot per Student) decided to promote a course of Educational Technologies and Methodologies, focusing on active learning methodologies for a better understanding of mechanics, electronics and programming and development of these skills. During the whole process, the enrolled professors had access to research labs, as well as high skilled tutors and professors in the tech area. At the end of the course, all the enrolled were able to develop, by themselves, robotics projects for educational purposes. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Drifters that track their position are important tools in studying the hydrodynamic behavior of rivers. Drifters that can be tracked in real time have so far been rather expensive. Recently, due to the rise of the open-hardware revolution and the associated Arduino ecosystem, both GPS receivers and cellular modems have become available at lower prices to "tinkering scientists", i.e., scientists that like to build their own measurement devices as much as is possible. This article serves two goals. Firstly, we provide detailed instructions on how to build a low-power GPS drifter with local storage and cellular model that we tested in a fieldwork on the confluence of the Chindwin and Ayeyarwady rivers in Myanmar. The device was designed from easily connected off-the-shelf components, allowing construction without a background in electrical engineering. The instructions allow fellow geoscientists to recreate the device. Secondly, we set the following question: has the open-hardware revolution progressed to the point that a low-power GPS drifter that wirelessly transmits its position can be made from open-hardware components by most geoscientists?. We feel this question is relevant and timely as more low-cost open-hardware devices are promoted, but in practice applicability is often restricted to the "tinkering engineer". We argue that because of the plug-and-play nature of the components geoscientists should be able to construct these type of devices. However, to get such devices to operate at low power levels that fieldwork often demands requires detailed (micro)electrical expertise. © Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Building a completely open-source System-on-Chip (SoC) means using open-source tools, an open-source foundry Process Design Kit (PDK), and open-source IP libraries including standard cell libraries and analog blocks. Such an effort involves many challenges and cooperation among numerous entities. In this talk we present StriVe, a small open-source SoC designed using a flow based on open-source EDA tools and targeting a foundry process with an open-source PDK and IP libraries, from concept to silicon validation. By designing StriVe, we aim to prove that any skepticism around the use of open-source EDA tools and flows to generate custom ASIC designs is misplaced. © 2020 Association on Computer Machinery.

AB  - Precision aquaculture is a new field that allows farmers to have better control over aquaculture processes, facilitating decision-making and improving efficiency. The implementation and evaluation of a low-cost water-quality monitoring system based on open-source hardware, which is easy to rebuild for scientific applications, is reported in this paper. The proposed system measures temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH, taking records and sending information through a wireless protocol (ZigBee) to a graphical user interface which can display information numerically and graphically, as well as simultaneously storing the information in a database. These variables are very important for aquaculture, as they have a direct influence on critical culture parameters such as growth and survival. Although it is a low-cost system, it offers good quality data and demonstrates efficiency for its use in precision aquaculture. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Multispectral imaging (MI) techniques are being used very often to identify different properties of nature in several domains, going from precision agriculture to environmental studies, not to mention quality inspection of pharmaceutical production, art restoration, biochemistry, forensic sciences or geology, just to name some. Different implementations are commercially available from the industry and yet there is quite an interest from the scientific community to spread its use to the majority of society by means of cost effectiveness and ease of use for solutions. These devices make the most sense when combined with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), going a step further and alleviating repetitive routines which could be strenuous if traditional methods were adopted. In this work, a low cost and modular solution for a multispectral camera is presented, based on the use of a single panchromatic complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensor combined with a rotating wheel of interchangeable band pass optic filters. The system is compatible with open source hardware permitting one to capture, process, store and/or transmit data if needed. In addition, a calibration and characterization methodology has been developed for the camera, allowing not only for quantifying its performance, but also able to characterize other CMOS sensors in the market in order to select the one that best suits the budget and application. The process was experimentally validated by mounting the camera in a Dji Matrice 600 UAV to uncover vegetation indices in a reduced area of palm trees plantation. Results are presented for the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) showing a generated colored map with the captured information. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The importance of monitoring the pressures in the water supply system combined with the high cost of implementation and maintenance of devices capable of this, corroborated the objective of this study. Therefore, we seek to develop low-cost equipment to measure water pressure. For this, 15 MPR dataloggers were produced, costing R$ 208.15 each, calibrated with a commercial equipment. The equipment were installed in residences with different consumptions profiles and altitudes in the municipality of Lucas do Rio Verde, Mato Grosso, for 43 days. The results obtained were satisfied, promising, and showed that the equipment is robust and precise with a R² of 0.9986 when compared with the commercial equipment, in addition to being possible to evaluate the city’s supply system and the necessary interventions. © 2020 Associação Brasileira de Engenharia Sanitária e Ambiental go de acesso aberto distribuído nos termos de licença Creative Commons.

AB  - Microencapsulation is a widely studied cell therapy and tissue bioengineering technique, since it is capable of creating an immune-privileged site, protecting encapsulated cells from the host immune system. Several polymers have been tested, but sodium alginate is in widespread use for cell encapsulation applications, due to its low toxicity and easy manipulation. Different cell encapsulation methods have been described in the literature using pressure differences or electrostatic changes with high cost commercial devices (about 30,000 US dollars). Herein, a low-cost device (about 100 US dollars) that can be created by commercial syringes or 3D printer devices has been developed. The capsules, whose diameter is around 500 µm and can decrease or increase according to the pressure applied to the system, is able to maintain cells viable and functional. The hydrogel porosity of the capsule indicates that the immune system is not capable of destroying host cells, demonstrating that new studies can be developed for cell therapy at low cost with microencapsulation production. This device may aid pre-clinical and clinical projects in low-and middle-income countries and is lined up with open source equipment devices. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Servo systems are feedback control systems characterized by position, speed, and/or acceleration outputs. Nowadays, industrial advances make the electronic stages in these systems obsolete compared to the mechanical elements, which generates a recurring problem in technological, commercial and industrial applications. This article presents a methodology for the development of an open-architecture controller that is based on reconfigurable hardware under the open source concept for servo applications. The most outstanding contribution of this paper is the implementation of a Genetic Algorithm for online self tuning with a focus on both high-quality servo control and reduction of vibrations during the positioning of a linear motion system. The proposed techniques have been validated on a real platform and form a novel, effective approach as compared to the conventional tuning methods that employ empirical or analytical solutions and cannot improve their parameter set. The controller was elaborated from the Graphical User Interface to the logical implementation while using free tools. This approach also allows for modification and updates to be made easily, thereby reducing the susceptibility to obsolescence. A comparison of the logical implementation with the manufacturer software was also conducted in order to test the performance of free tools in FPGAs. The Graphical User Interface developed in Python presents features, such as speed profiling, controller auto-tuning, measurement of main parameters, and monitoring of servo system vibrations. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Given the context of 20% increased number of individuals over 60 years till 2030 and further, there is emerging a real need to support elderly people in independent living while eHealth technologies proved to be promising solutions in this role. The paper presents an eHealth solution via co-design and Proof of Concept (PoC) perspective on Romanian elders, demarches led within the international Active and Assisted Living (AAL) Programme endorsing “smart solutions for ageing well” vision. The eHealth solution, based on open source hardware for interoperability and scalability, supports elders to collect biometric information at home and further provides this info to the corresponding caregivers/volunteers when needed in order to take actions accordingly in proper time. The eHealth system, planned according to Systems Engineering methodology, took in consideration Romanian end-user requirements whose verifications were performed via a PoC implementation. Subsequently the concept will become more comprehensive after several co-design sessions planned to be performed also in Hungary and Italy, partner countries in AAL project consortium. ©2020 IEEE

AB  - Resonant Schottky cavity pickups have applications in the measurements of beam parameters in a storage ring. Apart from that they can be used in nondestructive in-ring decay studies of radioactive ion beams. In order to obtain the results of an experiment suitable Data Acquisition System (DAQ) is necessary. Several DAQs were used at Experimental Storage Ring (ESR) at GSI based on the different hardware and software solutions such as TCAP or NTCAP. The goal of this work is to design a prototype of a DAQ using open hardware and open source software defined radio (SDR) and conduct the test measurements at ESR. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Human motion tracking (HMT) has been a research focus in the last decades. In this paper, we propose an IμTOA-fusion-based platform to solve this problem. Firstly, Time-of-arrival (TOA)-based distance ranging method is considered to compensate for the drifting errors and accumulation introduced by inertial sensors. Secondly, a geometrical kinematic model and maximum correntropy criterion (MCC)-based Kalman filter method are proposed to fuse the multiple information. The open-source hardware and software are detailed in this paper for real-time human motion capture and reconstruction applications. Experiment results show that our proposed hardware can be easily equipped for total body motion reconstruction with a considerable enhancement of the wear-ability and comfort. Furthermore, the main achievements have been presented with a performance comparison between the proposed platform and state-of-the-art commercial ones. Above all, our proposed platform can significantly suppress the accumulative error and drifting problem of conventional inertial systems. More importantly, it realizes the open-source software and hardware, thus it has promising prospects for wearable human motion tracking applications. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - A multi-port converter (MPC) consisting of a grid-forming port, a DC port, and a split-phase-AC port is proposed which can be used as building blocks in hybrid AC-DC systems such as community microgrids enabling intra-community and inter-community energy sharing. Commercially available off-the-shelf SiC power modules are used to achieve a modular hardware design for ease of assembly and maintenance. Unified virtual oscillator control (uVOC) is used to enable grid-forming operation. uVOC enables enhanced fault ride-through with fast over-current limiting; furthermore, operation in grid-connected and islanded modes and seamless transition between the two are achieved. Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) with secondary and tertiary level reference dispatch capability is obtained through an integrated cyber node enabled by open-source hardware and software. Experimental results using a full-scale prototype is provided to validate the design. Using a battery energy storage system (BESS) connected at the DC port of the MPC, black-start, islanded and grid-tied operation, unintentional islanding, and grid re-synchronization capabilities are demonstrated. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Relevant to mobile health, the design of a portable electrocardiograph (ECG) device using AD823X microchips as the analog front-end is presented. Starting with the evaluation board of the chip, open-source hardware and software components were integrated into a breadboard prototype. This required modifying the microchip with the breadboard-friendly Arduino Nano board in addition to a data logger and a Bluetooth breakout board. The digitized ECG signal can be transmitted by serial cable, via Bluetooth to a PC, or to an Android smartphone system for visualization. The data logging shield provides gigabytes of storage, as the signal is recorded to a microSD card adapter. A menu incorporates the device’s several operating modes. Simulation and testing assessed the system stability and performance parameters in terms of not losing any sample data throughout the length of the recording and finding the maximum sampling frequency; and validation determined and resolved problems that arose in open-source development. Ultimately, a custom printed circuit board was produced requiring advanced manufacturing options of 2.5 mils trace widths for the small package components. The fabricated device did not degrade the AD823X noise performance, and an ECG waveform with negligible distortion was obtained. The maximum number of samples/second was 2380 Hz in serial cable transmission, whereas in microSD recording mode, a continuous ECG signal for up to 36 h at 500 Hz was verified. A low-cost, high-quality portable ECG for long-term monitoring prototype that reasonably complies with electrical safety regulations and medical equipment design was realized. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Both the free and open source software (FOSS) as well as the distributed digital manufacturing of free and open source hardware (FOSH) has shown particular promise among scientists for developing custom scientific tools. Early research found substantial economic savings for these technologies, but as the open source design paradigm has grown by orders of magnitude it is possible that the savings observed in the early work was isolated to special cases. Today there are examples of open source technology for science in the vast majority of disciplines and several resources dedicated specifically to publishing them. Do the tremendous economic savings observed earlier hold today? To answer that question, this study evaluates free and open source technologies in the two repositories compared to proprietary functionally-equivalent tools as a function of their use of Arduino-based electronics, RepRap-class 3-D printing, as well as the combination of the two. The results of the review find overwhelming evidence for a wide range of scientific tools, that open source technologies provide economic savings of 87% compared to equivalent or lesser proprietary tools. These economic savings increased slightly to 89% for those that used Arduino technology and even more to 92% for those that used RepRap-class 3-D printing. Combining both Arduino and 3-D printing the savings averaged 94% for free and open source tools over commercial equivalents. The results provide strong evidence for financial support of open source hardware and software development for the sciences. Given the overwhelming economic advantages of free and open source technologies, it appears financially responsible to divert funding of proprietary scientific tools and their development in favor of FOSH. Policies were outlined that provide nations with a template for strategically harvesting the opportunities provided by the free and open source paradigm. © 2020

AB  - Recently, the Internet of things(IoT) has received great attention, and the demand for IOT applications in various fields is increasing. But drawbacks of IoT, such as having to use dedicated equipment and having to pay for a flat fee monthly, do not satisfy the consumers' demands. These shortcomings of IoT is causing the appearance of users who try to design the environment of IoT that responds their demands and naturally, attempts to have monitoring system through open-source hardware like Arduino. Open source hardware has attracted a great deal of attention for the diffusion of the Internet of things as a key element of the Internet construction. The emergence of open source hardware, which has the advantage of low cost and easy and fast development, has made it possible to embody the idea of object Internet application services. In this paper, we design and implement a system that controls the objects in real time using open source hardware and MQTT protocol. Copyright © 2020 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

AB  - A bottom-illuminated orbital shaker designed for the cultivation of microalgae suspensions is described in this open-source hardware report. The instrument agitates and illuminates microalgae suspensions grown inside flasks. It was optimized for low production cost, simplicity, low power consumption, design flexibility, consistent, and controllable growth light intensity. The illuminated orbital shaker is especially well suited for low-resource research laboratories and education. It is an alternative to commercial instruments for microalgae cultivation. It improves on typical do-it-yourself microalgae growth systems by offering consistent and well characterized illumination light intensity. The illuminated growth area is 20 cm × 15 cm, which is suitable for three T75 tissue culture flasks or six 100 ml Erlenmeyer flasks. The photosynthetic photon flux density, is variable in eight steps (26-800μmol·m-2·s-1) and programmable in a 24-h light/dark cycle. The agitation speed is variable (0-210RPM). The overall material cost is around £300, including an entry-level orbital shaker. The build takes two days, requiring electronics and mechanical assembly capabilities. The instrument build is documented in a set of open-source protocols, design files, and source code. The design can be readily modified, scaled, and adapted for other orbital shakers and specific experimental requirements. The instrument function was validated by growing fresh-water microalgae Desmodesmus quadricauda and Chlorella vulgaris. The cultivation protocols, microalgae growth curves, and doubling times are included in this report. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Despite advances in measuring fluid viscosity, we still lack portable viscometers to analyze shear rate-varying fluid characteristics in the form of open-source hardware that non-expert users can easily make and use. We present a hand-held, automatic capillary viscometer, termed "Viscopette", which can be fabricated simply by assembling globally available mechanical (a stepper motor and an inline pressure sensor), fluidic (a positive-displacement pipette and a cut tubing piece), electronic (an Arduino board) parts in a 3D-printed housing. The Viscopette is specifically designed to improve user experience by adopting how to use commercial micropipettes, and fits within 7.3 cm × 7.3 cm × 38.8 cm (without the cut tubing piece) with an overall weight of 437 g for portable use. By exploiting the high level of controllability of the open-source microcontroller, the Viscopettes enables time-varying shear-rate (or flow-rate) control for viscosity analysis, and simple viscosity measurement by calculating the ratio of a pressure value measured using the inline pressure sensor and a set flow-rate condition. With the advantages of ease-of-use, portability, and shear-rate controllability, we demonstrate the Viscopette's ability to accurately analyze Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. Our method addresses the unmet need in portable, high-performance viscometers suitable for use as an open-source equipment, which can facilitate on-site, accurate viscosity analysis even by non-expert users. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The field of Open Source Hardware Mechanical Ventilators (OSH-MVs) has seen a steep rise of contributions during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. As predictions showed that the number of patients would exceed current supply of hospital-grade ventilators, a number of formal (academia, the industry and governments) and informal (fablabs and startups) entities raced to develop cheap, easy-to-fabricate mechanical ventilators. The presence of actors with very diverse modus operandi as well as the speed at which the field has grown, led to a fragmented design space characterized by a lack of clear design patterns, projects not meeting the minimum functional requirements or showing little-to-no innovation; but also valid alternatives to hospital-grade devices. In this paper we provide a taxonomic system to help researchers with no background in biomedical engineering to read, understand and contribute to the OSH-MV field. The taxonomy is composed of ten properties that are read through the lenses of three reflection criteria: buildability, adoptability and scalability. We applied the taxonomy to the analysis of seventeen OSH-MV projects, which are representative of the current landscape of possibilities available for COVID-19 patients. We discuss the different design choices adopted by each project highlighting strengths and weaknesses and we suggest possible directions for the development of the OSH-MV field. © 2020

AB  - Light sensors can provide valuable information about environmental exposure; however, current light sensing packages are limited. This work presents the development of an open-source hardware device capable of logging light measurements. Due to its lightweight, wearable construction, it is well-suited to human subject research in naturalistic conditions. Its low cost makes it a viable option for population studies. This work offers an example application of objectively determining whether a person is indoors or outdoors based on the light measurements. This application has practical value within disciplines such as environmental and health psychology, which seek to relate psychological outcomes to environmental exposure. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Automation liberates scientific staff from repetitive tasks, decreases the probability of human error and consequently enhances the reproducibility of lab experiments. However, the use of laboratory automation in academic laboratories is limited due to high acquisition costs and the inability to customize off-the-shelf hardware. To address these challenges, we present an Open Source Hardware concept, referred to as OpenWorkstation, to build an assembly line-inspired platform consisting of ready-to-use and customizable modules. In contrast to current standalone solutions, the OpenWorkstation concept enables the combination of single hardware modules – each with a specific set of functionalities – to a modular workstation to provide a fully automated setup. The base setup consists of a pipetting and transport module and is designed to execute basic protocol steps for in vitro research applications, including pipetting operations for liquids and viscous substances and transportation of cell culture vessels between the modules. We demonstrate the successful application of this concept within a case study by the development of a storage module to facilitate high-throughput studies and a photo-crosslinker module to initiate photo-induced polymerization of hydrogel solutions. We present a Systems Engineering framework for customized module development, guidance for the design and assembly of the presented modules, and operational instructions on the usage of the workstation. By combining capabilities from various open source instrumentations into a modular technology platform, the OpenWorkstation concept will facilitate efficient and reliable experimentation for in vitro research. Ultimately, this concept will allow academic groups to improve replicability and reproducibility in cell culture process operations towards more economical and innovative research in the future. © 2020

AB  - With the increasing interest in high throughput screening and parallel assays, laboratories around the world inevitably find themselves in need of driving a multitude of fluid lines to facilitate their large scale studies. The comparatively low cost and no-fluid-contact design of peristaltic pumps make them the go-to systems for such ventures, but using commercially available pumping systems this still becomes a costly endeavor at typically $250-$1000 per pump line. Here we have developed an alternative, a peristaltic pump that can be fabricated in most research laboratories using 3D-printing and readily available off-the-shelf parts. The pump features 8 parallel channels with linear ranges spanning from 0.7 µL/min to 6 mL/min. The pump can be fabricated and assembled by anyone with access to a 3D-printer at a cost of less than $45 per channel and is driven by a stepper motor that connects directly to any computer. This device has the potential to be disruptive in areas such as drug screening and assay development, as well as lab-on-a-chip applications and cell cultivation, where it significantly reduces hardware expenses and allows for construction of more comprehensive fluidic systems at a fraction of current costs. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Commercial modules for learning advanced control systems are not quite common and some are very expensive due to their sensors, electronic and license. There is an open area to develop and to build didactic modules to improve the learning process using experimentation in real physical systems. Particularly, a cart inverted pendulum is a classical physical system very commonly used in recent decades. We propose a cart inverted pendulum named MoDiCA-X as a low-cost didactic module with open source hardware and software. It is an electromechanical system feasible to build and easy to be modified. The mechanical parts of the module are 3D printed solids and can also be easily replicated. In terms of programming, the control applied to the system can be modified, since it uses C/C++ programming languages that are widely used in the academic community. The module is equipped with two very commercial sensors, are easy to install and to remove; both acquire the pendulum attitude and the car position. The actuators are four electric DC motors coupled to the car wheels to provide suitable velocity and torque to each axle independently. We validate the performance of the module by applying a multivariable linear quadratic regulator algorithm (LQR). © 2020

AB  - The development of lab-on-a-chip technology and its applications in biochemical and biomedical analyses has, during the last two decades, led to the potential realisation of portable and on-site detection devices, the so-called point-of-care (PoC) detection systems. These are essentially cheap, easy-to-handle systems, offering rapid sample-to-answer results to non-technical operators. In this perspective, we do not review all the current advances of Lab-on-a-chip techniques for the realisation of PoC. Instead, we aim to provide insight into what we foresee as the three most important factors to play the essential roles for succeeding in making commercially viable PoC pathogen-detection devices. The three insights are namely: the utilizations of (i) disposable polymer (microfluidic) chips, (ii) the implementation of surface-bound (or solid-phase) nucleic-acid amplification techniques and (iii) relying (more) on open-source hardware and software. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Hydrocarbon contamination plagues high-resolution and analytical electron microscopy by depositing carbonaceous layers onto surfaces during electron irradiation, which can render carefully prepared specimens useless. Increased specimen thickness degrades resolution with beam broadening alongside loss of contrast. The large inelastic cross-section of carbon hampers accurate atomic species detection. Oxygen and water molecules pose problems of lattice damage by chemically etching the specimen during imaging. These constraints on high-resolution and spectroscopic imaging demand clean, high-vacuum microscopes with dry pumps. Here, we present an open-hardware design of a high-vacuum manifold for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) holders to mitigate hydrocarbon and residual species exposure. We quantitatively show that TEM holders are inherently dirty and introduce a range of unwanted chemical species. Overnight storage in our manifold reduces contaminants by one to two orders of magnitude and promotes two to four times faster vacuum recovery. A built-in bakeout system further reduces contaminants partial pressure to below 10-10 hPa (Torr) (approximately four orders of magnitude down from ambient storage) and alleviates monolayer adsorption during a typical TEM experiment. We determine that bakeout of TEM holder with specimen held therein is the optimal cleaning method. Our high-vacuum manifold design is published with open-source blueprints, parts, and cost list.

AB  - Implementations of light-sheet microscopes are often incompatible with standard methods of sample mounting. Light-sheet microscopy uses orthogonal illumination and detection to create a thin sheet of light which does not illuminate the sample outside of the depth of field of the detection axis. Typically, this configuration involves a pair of orthogonal objectives which constrains the positioning and length of cover slips in the range of the detection objective. Here, we present an open-hardware sample mounting system for light-sheet microscopes using large detection objectives, built using 3D printed components and demonstrate the chamber's efficacy on live biological samples in a custom light-sheet microscope. Lay Description: Implementations of light-sheet microscopes are often incompatible with standard methods of sample mounting. Light-sheet microscopy creates a thin sheet of light at a certain depth of field within a volumetric sample.

AB  - DNA electrophoresis is a fundamental technique in molecular biology that allows the separation of DNA molecules up to ~50 Kbp. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [PFGE] is a variation of the conventional DNA electrophoresis technique that allows the separation of very large DNA molecules up to ~10 Mbp. PFGE equipment is very expensive and it becomes an access barrier to many laboratories. Also, just a few privative designs of the equipment are available and it becomes difficult for the community to improve or customize their functioning. Here, we provide an open source PFGE equipment capable of the separation of DNA molecules up to, at least, ~2 Mbp and at low cost: USD$850, about 3% of the price of typical commercial equipment. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Two-photon (2P) microscopy is a cornerstone technique in neuroscience research. However, combining 2P imaging with spectrally arbitrary light stimulation can be challenging due to crosstalk between stimulation light and fluorescence detection. To overcome this limitation, we present a simple and low-cost electronic solution based on an ESP32 microcontroller and a TLC5947 LED driver to rapidly time-interleave stimulation and detection epochs during scans. Implemented for less than $100, our design can independently drive up to 24 arbitrary spectrum LEDs to meet user requirements. We demonstrate the utility of our stimulator for colour vision experiments on the in vivo tetrachromatic zebrafish retina and for optogenetic circuit mapping in Drosophila. © 2020

AB  - Low-cost high-resolution metal 3-D printing remains elusive for the scientific community. Low-cost gas metal arc wire (GMAW)-based 3-D printing enables wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) for near net shape applications, but has limited resolution due to the complexities of the arcing process. To begin to monitor and thus control these complexities, the initial designs of the open source GMAW 3-D printer have evolved to include current and voltage monitoring. Building on this prior work, in this study, the design, fabrication and use of the open source arc analyzer is described. The arc analyzer is a multi-sensor monitoring system for quantifying the processing during WAAM, which includes voltage, current, sound, light intensity, radio frequency, and temperature data outputs. The open source arc analyzer is tested here on aluminum WAAM by varying wire feed rate and measuring the resultant changes in the sensor data. Visual inspection and microstructural analysis of the printed samples looking for the presence of porosity are used as the physical indicators of quality. The value of the sensors was assessed and the most impactful sensors were found to be the light and radio frequency sensors, which showed arc extinction events and a characteristic “good weld” peak frequency. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - A major frontier in neuroscience is to find neural correlates of perception, learning, decision making, and a variety of other types of behavior. In the last decades, modern devices allow simultaneous recordings of different operant responses and the electrical activity of large neuronal populations. However, the commercially available instruments for studying operant conditioning are expensive, and the design of low-cost chambers has emerged as an appealing alternative to resource-limited laboratories engaged in animal behavior. In this article, we provide a full description of a platform that records the operant behavior and synchronizes it with the electrophysiological activity. The programming of this platform is open source, flexible, and adaptable to a wide range of operant conditioning tasks. We also show results of operant conditioning experiments with freely moving rats with simultaneous electrophysiological recordings. © 2020

AB  - To assist firefighters and other first responders to use their existing equipment for respiration during the COVID-19 pandemic without using single-use, low-supply, masks, this study outlines an open source kit to convert a 3M-manufactured Scott Safety self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) into a powered air-purifying particulate respirator (PAPR). The open source PAPR can be fabricated with a low-cost 3-D printer and widely available components for less than $150, replacing commercial conversion kits saving 85% or full-fledged proprietary PAPRs saving over 90%. The parametric designs allow for adaptation to other core components and can be custom fit specifically to fire-fighter equipment, including their suspenders. The open source PAPR has controllable air flow and its design enables breathing even if the fan is disconnected or if the battery dies. The open source PAPR was tested for air flow as a function of battery life and was found to meet NIOSH air flow requirements for 4 h, which is 300% over expected regular use. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - The use of electrical resistivity tomography in laboratory or field experiments for environmental purposes has been increasing in recent years. The development of commercial devices has thus far focused on the quality of measurements and their robustness in all field cases. However, both their costs and lack of flexibility to adapt to specific applications have limited their prevalence in the environmental sector. This article presents the development of a low-cost, open hardware resistivity meter to provide the scientific community with a robust and flexible tool for small-scale experiments. Called OhmPi, this basic resistivity meter features current injection and measurement functions associated with a multiplexer that allows performing automatic measurements with up to 32 electrodes (at a cost of less than $500). The device was first tested using a soil-analog electrical circuit to verify the reliability and robustness of the measurements. Results show that OhmPi offers a wide range of resistance measurements, from 0.2 to 1000 O, for contact resistances between 100 and 5000 O. Measurements were then carried out on a small field experiment, in demonstrating good stability of the OhmPi measurements, as well as a strong correlation with the output of a commercial reference instrument. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Access to nasopharyngeal swabs for sampling remain a bottleneck in some regions for COVID-19 testing. This study develops a distributed manufacturing solution using only an open source manufacturing tool chain consisting of two types of open source 3-D printing and batch UV curing, and provides a parametric fully free design of a nasopharyngeal swab. The swab was designed using parametric OpenSCAD in two components (a head with engineered break point and various handles), which has several advantages: i) minimizing print time on relatively slow SLA printers, ii) enabling the use of smaller print volume open source SLA printers, iii) reducing the amount of relatively expensive UV resin, and iv) enabling production of handle on more accessible material extrusion 3-D printers. A modular open source UV LED box was designed, fabricated for $45 and tested for batch curing. Swabs can be fabricated for $0.06-$0.12/swab. The results of the mechanical validation tests showed that the swabs could withstand greater forces than would be expected in normal clinical use. The swabs were also able to absorb a significant amounts of synthetic mucus materials and passed abrasion and handling tests. The results show the open source swab are promising candidates for clinical trials. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Thermal sterilization is generally avoided for 3-D printed components because of the relatively low deformation temperatures for common thermoplastics used for material extrusion-based additive manufacturing. 3-D printing materials required for high-temperature heat sterilizable components for COVID-19 and other applications demands 3-D printers with heated beds, hot ends that can reach higher temperatures than polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) hot ends and heated chambers to avoid part warping and delamination. There are several high temperature printers on the market, but their high costs make them inaccessible for full home-based distributed manufacturing required during pandemic lockdowns. To allow for all these requirements to be met for under $1000, the Cerberus – an open source three-headed self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) was designed and tested with the following capabilities: i) 200 °C-capable heated bed, ii) 500 °C-capable hot end, iii) isolated heated chamber with 1 kW space heater core and iv) mains voltage chamber and bed heating for rapid start. The Cereberus successfully prints polyetherketoneketone (PEKK) and polyetherimide (PEI, ULTEM) with tensile strengths of 77.5 and 80.5 MPa, respectively. As a case study, open source face masks were 3-D printed in PEKK and shown not to warp upon widely home-accessible oven-based sterilization. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - This study describes the development of a simple and easy-to-build portable automated bag valve mask (BVM) compression system, which, during acute shortages and supply chain disruptions can serve as a temporary emergency ventilator. The resuscitation system is based on the Arduino controller with a real-time operating system installed on a largely RepRap 3-D printable parametric component-based structure. The cost of the materials for the system is under $170, which makes it affordable for replication by makers around the world. The device provides a controlled breathing mode with tidal volumes from 100 to 800 mL, breathing rates from 5 to 40 breaths/minute, and inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio from 1:1 to 1:4. The system is designed for reliability and scalability of measurement circuits through the use of the serial peripheral interface and has the ability to connect additional hardware due to the object-oriented algorithmic approach. Experimental results after testing on an artificial lung for peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), respiratory rate (RR), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), tidal volume, proximal pressure, and lung pressure demonstrate repeatability and accuracy exceeding human capabilities in BVM-based manual ventilation. Future work is necessary to further develop and test the system to make it acceptable for deployment outside of emergencies such as with COVID-19 pandemic in clinical environments, however, the nature of the design is such that desired features are relatively easy to add using protocols and parametric design files provided. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Vision-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (vSLAM) has significant utility as an alternative to the costly inertial and acoustic sensors that conventional Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) rely on for navigation and mapping. However, the dearth of open-source, low-cost AUV platforms available for vSLAM research necessitates significant overhead for vehicle development for any underwater vSLAM research. In order to democratize access to marine robotics research we contribute a set of open-source hardware augmentations and software packages built on top of the BlueROV2 platform to allow researchers to build a low-cost Hovering AUV to facilitate autonomous vSLAM research. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - This paper proposes the first known to us open source hardware and software iris recognition system with presentation attack detection (PAD), which can be easily assembled for about 75 USD using Raspberry Pi board and a few peripherals. The primary goal of this work is to offer a low-cost baseline for spoof-resistant iris recognition, which may (a) stimulate research in iris PAD and allow for easy prototyping of secure iris recognition systems, (b) offer a low-cost secure iris recognition alternative to more sophisticated systems, and (c) serve as an educational platform. We propose a lightweight image complexity-guided convolutional network for fast and accurate iris segmentation, domain-specific human-inspired Binarized Statistical Image Features (BSIF) to build an iris template, and to combine 2D (iris texture) and 3D (photometric stereo-based) features for PAD. The proposed iris recognition runs in about 3.2 seconds and the proposed PAD runs in about 4.5 seconds on Raspberry Pi 3B+. The hardware specifications and all source codes of the entire pipeline are made available along with this paper. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - The adoption of solar photovoltaic energy in the residential sector is growing rapidly. Every year millions of new systems are installed. Most of these systems are not equipped with a monitoring system. We propose to develop an efficient and open hardware software monitoring system for photovoltaic installations. The proposed energy monitoring system is designed to be low cost, simple to use, robust (handles internet outage) and data must be easily accessible via different mobile and web platforms. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - The commercial data acquisition instruments designed for three-component microtremor measurements are usually very expensive devices. In this paper, a low-cost, computer-Aided, and geophone-based system designed to record, monitor, and analyze three-component microtremor data is presented. This proposed system is not a simple data acquisition system. It is also an integrated system developed to interpret the microtremor data using the horizontalto-vertical spectral ratio (H = V) method without any external software. Therefore, the H=V peak frequency and amplitude can be easily estimated using this system. The proposed system has several features such as a 200 Hz sampling frequency, approximately 72 dB dynamic range, text data format, and data analysis tools. This system consists of a graphical user interface developed by using the .NET Framework 4.5.2 and external hardware that includes signal conditioning circuits, voltage converter circuit, external analogto-digital converter, and Arduino Uno board. The proposed system uses low-cost vertical and horizontal geophones with a 4.5 Hz natural frequency to measure three-component microtremor data. The developed software undertakes many tasks such as communication between the external hardware and computer, transferring, monitoring, and recording the seismic data to the computer, and interpretation of the recorded data using the Nakamura method. Channel consistency and internal noise measurement tests were performed to demonstrate the accuracy and precision of the proposed system. The proposed system was compared to a commercial triaxial digital seismograph, and satisfactory results were obtained. The developed system is a completely open-source and open-hardware system and can be easily used in academic studies conducted by researchers and university students who are interested in seismic ambient noise analysis. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

AB  - Some of the most promising distributed recycling and additive manufacturing (DRAM) technical systems use fused particle fabrication (FPF) or fused granular fabrication (FGF), where compression screws force post-consumer waste plastic through a heated nozzle for direct 3D printing. To assist the technical evolution of these systems, this study provided the details of an invention for a low-cost, easily replicable open-source grinding machine for compression screw manufacturing. The system itself can be largely fabricated using FPF/FGF following the self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) methodology. This grinding machine can be made from a cordless cut-off grinder and < $155 in parts. The new invention is demonstrated to be able to cut custom screws with variable (i) channel depths, (ii) screw diameters, (iii) screw lengths, (iv) pitches, (v) abrasive disk thicknesses, (vi) handedness of the screws, (vii) and materials (three types of steel tested: 1045 steel, 1144 steel, and 416 stainless steel). The results show that the device is more than capable of replicating commercial screws as well as providing makers with a much greater flexibility to make custom screws. This invention enables the DRAM toolchain to become even more self-sufficient, which assists the goals of the circular economy. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Additive manufacturing (AM) is an important, rapidly emerging, manufacturing technology that takes the information from a computer-aided design (CAD) and builds parts in a layer-by-layer style. Thus, since the development of 3D printing, the fused deposition modeling (FDM) is one of the most promising and inexpensive techniques for shaping free-form parts. It used a thermoplastic filament as a starting material to extrude, layer by layer, the suitable 3D object. It is assisted by a large community of developers, searchers, and users and with multiple free hardware and software open sources expanding the scope of its applications. However, in this process, printing objects with multi-materials and multicolors becomes a major challenge for most extrusion system of printing platforms. For example, in case it is required to print multi-material and multicolored parts, a high-quality head extruder should be used. The main objective of this work is to show the importance of proposing a new extruder system of printing parts with multicolors and materials. For this purpose, in the present paper, the different extrusion systems capable of printing parts with multicolors and materials were presented. The operating principle of each extrusion system is well explained through functional diagrams. Then, its advantages and disadvantages are cited. Finally, some prospects for improving these systems are presented and that will be the work of the next paper. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In vivo electrophysiology experiments require the collection of data from multiple subjects, often for extended periods. Studying multiple subjects for extended periods can be made more efficient through simultaneous recordings, but scaling up recordings to accommodate larger numbers of subjects simultaneously requires coordination and consideration of costs and flexibility. To facilitate this process, we have developed OpBox, an open source set of tools to acquire electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) flexibly from multiple rodent subjects simultaneously. OpBox combines open source hardware and software with off-the-shelf components to create a system that costs less than commercial solutions ($500 per subject), and can be easily deployed for multiple subjects. Coded in MATLAB, OpBox scripts can simultaneously and flexibly collect and display multiple analog and digital data streams, for instance real-time EEG and EMG, event triggers from a behavioral system, and rotary encoder data. OpBox also calculates and displays real-time spectral representations and event-related potentials (ERPs). To verify the performance of our system, we compare our amplifiers with two other commercial amplifiers, a Grass P55 AC preamplifier and an Intan RHD2000-series amplifier. The OpBox amplifier performs comparably to commercial amplifiers for signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), noise floors, and common mode rejection. We also demonstrate that our acquisition system can reliably record multichannel data from multiple subjects, and has been successfully tested with 12 subjects running simultaneously on a single standard desktop computer. Together, OpBox increases the flexibility and lowers the cost for simultaneous acquisition of electrophysiology data from multiple subjects. Copyright © 2020 Kimchi et al.

AB  - Zooplankton play vital ecological roles that maintain aquatic ecosystems. Imaging instruments have enabled in situ observations of these organisms that can be automated and are less invasive than traditional sampling methods. However, these instruments are often costly and require sophisticated engineering expertise to operate. The In situ Plankton Assemblage eXplorer (IPAX) is an open-source low-cost imaging platform for zooplankton studies. The IPAX is a programmable instrument that has powerful LED illumination and a high-resolution camera that can image zooplankton in situ, while material costs are less than USD $450. The optical performance of the instrument was calibrated in the laboratory using a calibration target and preserved zooplankton. The IPAX was then deployed in the field to observe diversity, emergent patterns and phototactic behaviour of demersal zooplankton at night to demonstrate its practicality. Laboratory calibration indicated that the IPAX can resolve 100 µm features with 70% contrast at the focal plane with 5 cm × 3 cm field of view and 5 mm depth of field. The instrument also resolved fine morphological details of preserved zooplankton when in focus. The field deployment demonstrated capability to resolve the myriad of zooplankton present in addition to the different phototactic behaviour that was elicited and observed from the different colour LEDs. The IPAX enables economical and autonomous surveys of zooplankton in various aquatic habitats. Its low cost facilitates construction and deployment of multiple units that can cover large spatial areas, while its versatility also allows adaptations to many experimental needs for aquatic ecology. © 2020 The Author.

AB  - The separation of suspensions and immiscible liquids by the laboratory centrifuge is widely used in such fields as chemistry, biology, biochemistry, and clinical medicine. In this paper, an Arduino-based microcentrifuge was fabricated using a computer DVD (digital versatile disc) drive. The hardware part consisted of inexpensive mechanical and electronic parts such as the recycled parts of a computer DVD drive, an Arduino microcontroller, a motor driver, a magnetic sensor (for speed measurement), and a display. The microcentrifuge provided a wide speed range of 1,000-10,000 rpm. The fabrication process is easy, and the total fabrication cost of the fabricated microcentrifuge is less than $25. Since the fabricated microcentrifuge has open-source hardware and software parts, it is appropriate for educational purposes and laboratory settings.

AB  - Fast and accurate depth estimation, or stereo matching, is essential in embedded stereo vision systems, requiring substantial design effort to achieve an appropriate balance among accuracy, speed and hardware cost. To reduce the design effort and achieve the right balance, we propose FP-Stereo for building high-performance stereo matching pipelines on FPGAs automatically. FP-Stereo consists of an open-source hardware-efficient library, allowing designers to obtain the desired implementation instantly. Diverse methods are supported in our library for each stage of the stereo matching pipeline and a series of techniques are developed to exploit the parallelism and reduce the resource overhead. To improve the usability, FP-Stereo can generate synthesizable C code of the FPGA accelerator with our optimized HLS templates automatically. To guide users for the right design choice meeting specific application requirements, detailed comparisons are performed on various configurations of our library to investigate the accuracy/speed/cost trade-off. Experimental results also show that FP-Stereo outperforms the state-of-the-art FPGA design from all aspects, including 6.08% lower error, 2x faster speed, 30% less resource usage and 40% less energy consumption. Compared to GPU designs, FP-Stereo achieves the same accuracy at a competitive speed while consuming much less energy. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - OpenSWAP is a class of innovative open architecture, low cost autonomous vehicles for geological/geophysical studies of shallow water environments. Although they can host different types of sensors, these vehicles were specifically designed for geophysical surveys, i.e., for the acquisition of bathymetric and stratigraphic data through single- and multibeam echosounders, side-scan sonars, and seismic-reflection systems. The main characteristic of the OpenSWAP vehicles is their ability of following pre-defined routes with high accuracy under acceptable weather and sea conditions. This would open the door to 4D (repeated) surveys, which constitute a powerful tool to analyze morphological and stratigraphic changes of the sediment/water interface and of the shallow substratum eventually caused by sediment dynamics (erosion vs. deposition), slumps and gravitative failures, earthquakes (slip along seismogenic faults and secondary effects of shaking), tsunamis, etc. The low cost and the open hardware/software architectures of these systems, which can be modified by the end users, lead for planning and execution of cooperative and adaptive surveys with different instruments not yet implemented or tested. Together with a technical description of the vehicles, we provide different case studies where they were successfully employed, carried out in environments not, or very difficultly accessed through conventional systems. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - This book is about the Arduino microcontroller and the Arduino concept. The visionary Arduino team of Massimo Banzi, David Cuartielles, Tom Igoe, Gianluca Martino, and David Mellis launched a new innovation in microcontroller hardware in 2005, the concept of open-source hardware. Their approach was to openly share details of microcontroller-based hardware design platforms to stimulate the sharing of ideas and promote innovation. This concept has been popular in the software world for many years. In June 2019, Joel Claypool and I met to plan the fourth edition of Arduino Microcontroller Processing for Everyone! Our goal has been to provide an accessible book on the rapidly evolving world of Arduino for a wide variety of audiences including students of the ?ne arts, middle and senior high school students, engineering design students, and practicing scientists and engineers. To make the book even more accessible to better serve our readers, we decided to change our approach and provide a series of smaller volumes. Each volume is written to a speci?c audience. This book, Arduino II: Systems, is a detailed treatment of the ATmega328 processor and an introduction to C programming and microcontroller-based systems design. Arduino I: Getting Started provides an introduction to the Arduino concept. Arduino III: the Internet of Things explores Arduino applications in the Internet of Things (IoT). © 2020 by Morgan & Claypool All rights reserved.

AB  - Overview: In this article we frame the concept of a hardware-rich open source ecosystem (H-ROSE) that generates software and hardware components. In an H-ROSE, the designs of some components are accessible under open source licenses, while other component designs remain proprietary. We describe seven adoption factors used by the multinational French firm Thales to assess the efficacy of RISC-V to design processors. Other companies can use these adoption factors to explore whether an open hardware initiative supported by an H-ROSE is worthwhile. © 2020, Copyright © 2020, Innovation Research Interchange.

AB  - In this study, applications of the Arduino platform in the mining industry were reviewed. Arduino, a representative and popular open-source hardware, can acquire information from various sensors, transmit data using communication technology, and control devices through actuators. The review was conducted by classifying previous studies into three types of Arduino applications: field monitoring systems, wearable systems, and autonomous systems. With regard to field monitoring systems, most studies in mines were classified as atmospheric or geotechnical monitoring. In wearable systems, the health status of the miner was an important consideration, in addition to the environmental conditions of the mine. Arduino can be a useful tool as an initial prototype for autonomous mine systems. Arduino has advantages in that it can be combined with various electronic products and is cost-effective. Therefore, although many studies have been conducted in the laboratory (as opposed to field tests), Arduino applications can be further expanded in the mining field in the future. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - In this work, we develop open source hardware and software for eye state classification and integrate it with a protocol for the Internet of Things (IoT). We design and build the hardware using a reduced number of components and with a very low-cost. Moreover, we propose a method for the detection of open eyes (oE) and closed eyes (cE) states based on computing a power ratio between different frequency bands of the acquired signal. We compare several real- and complex-valued transformations combined with two decision strategies: a threshold-based method and a linear discriminant analysis. Simulation results show both classifier accuracies and their corresponding system delays. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - RTL simulation is a critical tool for hardware design but its current slow speed often bottlenecks the whole design process. Simulation speed becomes even more crucial for agile and open-source hardware design methodologies, because the designers not only want to iterate on designs quicker, but they may also have less resources with which to simulate them. In this article, we execute multiple simulators and analyze them with hardware performance counters. We find some open-source simulators not only outperform a leading commercial simulator, they also achieve comparable or higher instruction throughput on the host processor. Although advanced optimizations may increase the complexity of the simulator, they do not significantly hinder instruction throughput. Our findings make the case that there is significant room to accelerate software simulation and open-source simulators are a great starting point for researchers. © 1981-2012 IEEE.

AB  - An important field of research within mechatronics includes the development of robotic platforms based on open source platforms, primarily focused on the operating system ROS (Robot Operating System). The main disadvantage regarding commercial robotic manipulators is based on the lack of flexibility in design, because constantly hardware is protected by copyright or partially released. There is a need to develop a platform that facilitates robotics teaching and learning focused on open hardware and software with industrial applications. For the development of the project, the mechatronic systems design methodology proposed in the VDI 2206 standard was used. As a result, an anthropomorphic Open Software and Open Hardware Robot (OSH-OSS) with six degrees of freedom were obtained with a precision of 2.03 [mm] and repeatability of \pm 4.89 [mm], with a payload of 0.15 [kg] and a payload ratio of 5.21%. The proposal to replicate the manipulator within the subject of industrial robotics at the undergraduate level proved to improve the technical performance of the participants, facilitating the learning and the assimilation of complex concepts to acquire theoretically. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - The integration of large amounts of renewable energy will require multiterminal high-voltage direct-current (MTDC) grids to reliably transport the energy over long distances. However, before building an MTDC grid, a functional protection system design is needed. Realistic and industrial studies are required to validate the functionality of such a system. In addition, further academic research as well as education in the field are needed. This paper presents an open-source, low-cost protection intelligent electronic device (IED) prototype for use in a laboratory environment. In particular, the IED design, its fastest measured performance, example results for different fault scenarios, and an assessment of its use in education are shown. The open-source IED is useful to accelerate industrial and academic research, as well as to enable education in protection for MTDC grids. © 1969-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Affordable computing power and open source hardware have provided many opportunities to enhance STEM education for students. Consequently, numerous electronic retailers offer a diverse array of electronic or educational kits, however without a structured pedagogical framework, students without any prior experience simply learn how to interact with individual components and miss out on how they can be integrated into a system. In this paper, we present our experience in implementing a freshman mechanical engineering course focused on the following main objectives: 1) promoting a computation mindset, 2) providing opportunities to develop essential troubleshooting skills of hardware and software programs, 3) encouraging programming multilingualism and 4) stimulating self-learning and exploration of new hardware to foster lifelong learning skills. The students' lab experiences begin with structured lessons plans regarding analog and digital components and culminates with an open-ended project where students are tasked with developing a robot racer to compete with other students. During the course, students begin programming with MATLAB to reinforce engineering programming concepts and transition to using C programming to implement an embedded solution. A survey was provided to learn about the student's experiences and to help improve future course offerings. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.

AB  - The evolution of Mechatronics and Robotics Engineering (MRE) has enabled numerous technological advancements since the early 20th century. Professionals in this field are reshaping the world by designing smart and autonomous systems aiming to improve human well-being. Recognizing the need for preparing highly-educated MRE professionals, many universities and colleges are adopting MRE as a distinct degree program. One of the cornerstones of MRE education is laboratory- and project-based learning to provide a hands-on and engaging experience for the students. To this end, numerous software and hardware platforms have been developed and utilized in MRE courses and laboratories. Commercial products can provide a rich hands-on experience for the students, but they can be cost-prohibitive. On the other hand, open-source platforms are low-cost alternatives to their commercial counterparts and are being increasingly used in industry. Developing open-source laboratory platforms will be a more feasible option for a wider range of institutions and would enable familiarizing the students with recent technological trends in industry and exposing them to the development details of a real-world system. However, adoption of open-source platforms in MRE courses can be lengthy and time consuming. Educators who wish to utilize such systems typically lack the expertise in all aspects of their implementation which can make them difficult to troubleshoot. Debugging open-source systems can also be challenging because most of the troubleshooting is done through forum discussions which appear to be very noisy and unfocused. The flip side of this chaotic nature of the open-source world is that there is a vast amount of information available, including tutorials, examples, and commentary and, with some focused searching, debugging and usage questions can often get answered. There is also a disconnect between the forum participants, typically computer scientists and hobbyists, and MRE educators and students. Finally, the available resources and documentation for utilizing open-source platforms in MRE education are insufficient and incomprehensive. Therefore, the main goal of this paper is to increase awareness and familiarity with the use of open-source software and hardware packages in MRE education and practice towards accelerating their adoption. To this end, open-source software packages such as Python, GNU Octave, OpenFOAM, Java, Modelica, Gazebo, SPICE, Scilab, and Gnuplot, which have the potential to be useful in the modeling and analysis of MRE systems are introduced. Furthermore, low-cost and powerful opensource hardware packages such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and BeagleBone which can be used as the main processing unit for data acquisition and control implementation in a wide range of MRE systems are reviewed and their limitations and potentials are investigated. This paper provides a valuable resource for MRE students and faculty who would like to utilize open-source hardware and software platforms in their education and research. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.

AB  - This paper discusses undergraduate research to develop an augmented reality (AR) system for diagnostics and maintenance of the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) employed by U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps. The JLTV's diagnostic information will be accessed by attaching a Bluetooth adaptor (Ford Reference Vehicle Interface) to JLTV's On-board diagnostics (OBD) system. The proposed AR system will be developed for mobile devices (Android and iOS tablets and phones) and it communicates with the JLTV's OBD via Bluetooth. The AR application will contain a simplistic user interface that reads diagnostic data from the JLTV, shows vehicle sensors, and allows users to create virtual dashboards to display various information. It will also contain interactive presentation and visualization of JLTV external and internal parts and 3D animations for diagnostic and maintenance. The AR application will consist of two modes: Standalone Mode and AR Mode. Standalone Mode does not require a real vehicle and it contains interactive 3D visualizations and animations for diagnostic and maintenance. The AR Mode requires the presence of a vehicle and projects instructions and animations to the vehicle components and parts under diagnosis and maintenance. This project contains several major tasks: 1) 3D modeling of the vehicle, including all internal and external parts to be displayed in the AR application, 2) 3D printing of the vehicles that only requires the external parts that requires conversion from the file format used in Task 1 and further optimization of the model for 3D printing, 3) software development in Unity that utilizes mobile devices and Vuforia to generate the AR application for vehicle maintenance and operation, and 4) preliminary research on software and information architecture to support efficient development of AR applications. This project is most relevant to the following ABET outcomes: 1) an ability to function on multidisciplinary teams and 2) an ability to communicate effectively, and 3) an ability to use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice. This paper discusses the challenges and effective approaches in designing and executing undergraduate research projects that utilizing the latest computing and information technology for military applications, such as proper project scope, open source hardware and software, emulators for large scale equipment, 3D printing to reduce development complexity and facilitate rapid application development. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.

AB  - Visible light communication system arises to create wireless links using light-emitting diode luminaires. The literature reports multiple works in visible light communication using different development tools. However, most are based on signal processors, field-programmable gate Arrays and proprietary software to develop the algorithms. This paper presents a wireless optical communication system using amplitude modulation on both hardware and free software tools. An algorithm for amplitude modulation/demodulation in GNU Radio installed on the Raspberry Pi development card was created. Additionally, an optical transmitter based on a white light-emitting diode and a receiver with a solar panel was designed. Communication experiments were performed based on the distance of the system link. The results report that the optimal response of amplitude modulation/demodulation was achieved with a solar panel response of - 68 dBmV at maximum distance of 3 m between transmitter and receiver at usual illumination levels, and the potential to use free hardware and software tools in the implementation and analysis of optical wireless communication systems. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Free and open-source hardware (FOSH) is rapidly gaining momentum because it provides customized research hardware with over 90% savings compared to the costs of proprietary tools. However, the focused skill sets of researchers who aim to facilitate their own research limit FOSH complexity. The most expensive research equipment normally requires an interdisciplinary team. To overcome this complexity barrier and obtain large returns on investment for research funders by replacing the most expensive proprietary research equipment with FOSH, new development funding mechanisms are needed. To guide such research policy, this paper provides the first analysis of the strategic national benefit of applying the FOSH approach to major research equipment for any nation. The results of an example analysis for a single nation indicate Finland's science funders could save between 2.84–27.7m€/year directly on scientific equipment purchases if research hardware is converted to FOSH and the nation would likely garner the well-established concomitant benefits of increased research innovation within their economy. Finally, a detailed generalized model for determining national research policy in hardware development is derived and research policy mechanisms for accelerating FOSH deployment and greater accessibility to research equipment are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Dependable systems currently undergo a series of transformations, notably the shift to multi-core processors and the rise of concerns previously limited to the IT domain such as cybersecurity or cloud-like versatility. In this position paper we summarize the key challenges, and some promising solutions.In addition to software-based techniques devised for COTS multi-processors, emerging Open-Source processing platforms provide the ability to experiment domain-specific mitigation techniques that were previously deemed not economically feasible. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Open source hardware has developed rapidly since the last 2 decades, thanks to access to Internet and availability of novel interactive manufacturing technologies (for example 3D printing or collaborative platforms). Several researchers worked on how to characterize OSH. Bonvoisin and Mies (Procedia CIRP 78:388–393, 2018) defined the “open-o-meter”, i.e. a series of criteria to measure the openness of an OSH project. These criteria fall into two categories: product openness and process openness. The open-o-meter gives clear guidelines on measuring product openness by verifying access to specific types of documents, however the criteria to measure process openness are relatively implicit. In this paper, we propose to measure an OSH project’s process openness by identifying different types of collaboration tools in that project. We will evaluate 226 OSH projects’ process openness by analysing their usage of collaboration tools, for example social media, wiki, GitHub etc. This empirical study showed that the usage of collaboration tools in OSH projects decreases as the score of open-o-meter decreases, which implies that the open-o-meter measures correctly an OSH project’s process openness. This research not only validates open-o-meter, but also offers an explicit way to measure an OSH project’s process openness that might be very useful for companies to evaluate potential collaborations. © 2019, Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This paper presents a humanoid torso robot, named Woody. It has two arms, each with five degrees of freedom (DoF) and a 2-DoF neck supporting the head with two moving eyebrows. Woody's hardware is made primarily from laser-cut plywood. Two cameras, a microphone, a speaker, and a microprocessor board are embedded in the robot. The processor board also contains a wireless communication module for remote control and access to networked or cloudbased resources. The interactive functions include face tracking, facial emotion recognition, and several pre-programmed default gestures. Woody's graphical user interface (GUI) provides its users with instructions on hardware construction and initial setup. Through this GUI, the user can also program the robot and record new gestures by its motion recording function. Woody is developed as an open-source hardware platform that can also utilize open-source software for educational purposes. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - This report describes a direction-dependent optical microscope operated with Raspberry Pi, with LED array illumination patterns controlled by Raspberry Pi. Images are obtained with a Raspberry Pi camera module. We demonstrate the use of Raspberry-Pi-based microscopes for multimodal imaging including bright-field microscopy, dark-field microscopy, differential phase-contrast microscopy, and polarization microscopy. We also demonstrate acquisition of direction-dependent dark-field and differential phase-contrast images. From a pair of opposite line or rectangular illumination, structures along the illumination axis were enhanced in dark-field images and differential phase-contrast images. Raspberry-Pi is open-source hardware. Raspberry-Pi-based compact, cost-effective, and multi-contrast microscopes are expected to be useful for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Aim: Current pricing of commercial mechanical ventilators in low-/middle-income countries (LMICs) markedly restricts their availability, and consequently a considerable number of patients with acute/chronic respiratory failure cannot be adequately treated. Our aim was to design and test an affordable and easy-tobuild noninvasive bilevel pressure ventilator to allow a reduction in the serious shortage of ventilators in LMICs. Methods: The ventilator was built using off-the-shelf materials available via e-commerce and was based on a high-pressure blower, two pressure transducers and an Arduino Nano controller with a digital display (total retail cost <75 USD), with construction details provided open source for free replication. The ventilator was evaluated, and compared with a commercially available device (Lumis 150 ventilator; Resmed, San Diego, CA, USA): 1) in the bench setting using an actively breathing patient simulator mimicking a range of obstructive/restrictive diseases; and b) in 12 healthy volunteers wearing high airway resistance and thoracic/abdominal bands to mimic obstructive/restrictive patients. Results: The designed ventilator provided inspiratory/expiratory pressures up to 20/10 cmH2O, respectively, with no faulty triggering or cycling; both in the bench test and in volunteers. The breathing difficulty score rated (1-10 scale) by the loaded breathing subjects was significantly (p<0.005) decreased from 5.45±1.68 without support to 2.83±1.66 when using the prototype ventilator, which showed no difference with the commercial device (2.80±1.48; p=1.000). Conclusion: The low-cost, easy-to-build noninvasive ventilator performs similarly to a high-quality commercial device, with its open-source hardware description, which will allow for free replication and use in LMICs, facilitating application of this life-saving therapy to patients who otherwise could not be treated. © 2020 ERS.

AB  - The complexity of power grids in terms of generation and consumption transforms the traditional power system to a distributed one. This new paradigm obliges to a better monitoring and control. Herein, we present a low cost and compact device that allows to measure, energy, voltages and currents in three-phase networks. In addition, it has been designed to analyse PQ disturbances. This device is a smart meter and can be considered internet-based power quality monitoring. The statistics data are processed locally with built-in custom software, specifically designed for this purpose, which provides energy consumption or generation patterns in multiple visualization views. The design is released as open hardware and therefore it is presented to the community as a powerful tool. The system was installed in a real photovoltaic power plant over a long time, showing interesting results and findings, which validates our proposal. © 2020, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

AB  - Distributed digital manufacturing offers a solution to medical supply and technology shortages during pandemics. To prepare for the next pandemic, this study reviews the state-of-the-art of open hardware designs needed in a COVID-19-like pandemic. It evaluates the readiness of the top twenty technologies requested by the Government of India. The results show that the majority of the actual medical products have some open source development, however, only 15% of the supporting technologies required to produce them are freely available. The results show there is still considerable research needed to provide open source paths for the development of all the medical hardware needed during pandemics. Five core areas of future research are discussed, which include (i) technical development of a wide-range of open source solutions for all medical supplies and devices, (ii) policies that protect the productivity of laboratories, makerspaces, and fabrication facilities during a pandemic, as well as (iii) streamlining the regulatory process, (iv) developing Good-Samaritan laws to protect makers and designers of open medical hardware, as well as to compel those with knowledge that will save lives to share it, and (v) requiring all citizen-funded research to be released with free and open source licenses. © 2020 by the author.

AB  - Advanced dynamic analysis techniques such as fuzzing and Dynamic Symbolic Execution (DSE) are a cornerstone of software security testing and are becoming popular with embedded systems testing. Testing software in a virtual machine provides more visibility and control. VM snapshots also save testing time by facilitating crash reproduction, performing root cause analysis and avoiding re-executing programs from the start. However, because embedded systems are very diverse virtual machines that perfectly emulate them are often unavailable. Previous work therefore either attempt to model hardware or perform partial emulation (forwarding interaction to the real hardware), which leads to inaccurate or slow emulation. However, such limitations are unnecessary when the whole design is available, e.g., to the device manufacturer or on open hardware. In this paper, we therefore propose a novel approach, called HardSnap, for co-testing hardware and software with a high level of introspection. HardSnap aims at improving security testing of hardware/software co-designed systems, where embedded systems designers have access to the whole HW/SW stack. HardSnap is a virtual-machine-based solution that extends visibility and controllability to the hardware peripherals with a negligible overhead. HardSnap introduces the concept of a hardware snapshot that collects the hardware state (together with software state). In our prototype, Verilog hardware blocks are either simulated in software or synthesized to an FPGA. In both cases HardSnap is able to generate HW/SW snapshot on demand. HardSnap is designed to support new peripherals automatically, to have high performance, and full controllability and visibility on software and hardware. We evaluated HardSnap on open-source peripherals and synthetic firmware to demonstrate improved ability to find and diagnose security issues. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - One of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) declared by United Nation is Climate Action. Integrated climate change measurement is one of the point in this goal. The solution in this form is low cost and open source hardware to monitor weather and air quality real time. This study goals is developing Arduino platform to monitor wind speed, air temperature, air humidity, and smoke. All circuit board, electronic component specifications, and programming software are open source and freely available for anyone to use and modify. Inexpensive sensors and Arduino Uno were used to develop low cost system. This system send data to Thingspeak as Open Internet of Things (IoT) platform which provide real time data collection, data processing, and data visualization to users. This system provide a low cost solution (system cost around one million Rupiah) to monitor weather and air quality that easily deployed in the desired geographical area. The results are plotted in graphs to ease the users monitor data both locally and remotely. This system use Arduino Uno as main processor, Real Time Clock DS3231 to provide time information, anemometer to provide wind speed, DHT22 used as humidity and temperature sensor, MQ-2 used for smoke detection and CO level, and SIM900 as GSM shield for sending data to server. Results of measurements demonstrate the usefulness of this system in weather and air quality monitoring. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - In this paper we present the first generation of a secure platform developed by following a security-by-design approach. The security of the platform is built on top of two pillars: a secured hardware design flow and a secure microkernel. The hardware design is protected against the insertion of hardware Trojans during the production phase through netlist obfuscation provided by logic locking. The software stack is based on a trustworthy and verified microkernel. Moreover, the system is expected to work in an environment which does not allow physical access to the device. Therefore, on-the-field attacks are only possible via software. We present a solution whose security has been achieved by relying on simple and open hardware and software solutions, namely a RISC-V processor core, open-source peripherals and an seL4 - based operating system. © 2020 ACM.

AB  - In heterogeneous computer architectures, the serial part of an application is coupled with domain-specific accelerators that promise high computing throughput and efficiency across a wide range of applications. In such systems, the serial part of a program is executed on a Central Processing Unit (CPU) core optimized for single-thread performance, while parallel sections are offloaded to Programmable Manycore Accelerators (PMCAs). This heterogeneity requires CPU cores and PMCAs to share data in memory efficiently, although CPUs rely on a coherent memory system where data is transferred in cache lines, while PMCAs are based on non-coherent scratchpad memories where data is transferred in bursts by DMA engines. In this paper, we tackle the challenges and hardware complexity of bridging the gap from a non-coherent, burst-based memory hierarchy to a coherent, cache-line-based one. We design and implement an open-source hardware module that reaches 97% peak throughput over a wide range of realistic linear algebra kernels and is suited for a wide spectrum of memory architectures. Implemented in a state-of-the-art 22 nm FD-SOI technology, our module bridges up to 650 Gbps at 130 fJ/bit and has a complexity of less than 1 kGE/Gbps. © 2020 ACM.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to design and develop a new robotic device for the rehabilitation of the upper limbs. The authors are focusing on a new symmetrical robot which can be used to rehabilitate the right upper limb and the left upper limb. The robotic arm can be automatically extended or reduced depending on the measurements of the patient's arm. The main idea is to integrate electrical stimulation into motor rehabilitation by robot. The goal is to provide automatic electrical stimulation based on muscle status during the rehabilitation process. Design/methodology/approach: The developed robotic arm can be automatically extended or reduced depending on the measurements of the patient's arm. The system merges two rehabilitation strategies: motor rehabilitation and electrical stimulation. The goal is to take the advantages of both approaches. Electrical stimulation is often used for building muscle through endurance, resistance and strength exercises. However, in the proposed approach the electrical stimulation is used for recovery, relaxation and pain relief. In addition, the device includes an electromyography (EMG) muscle sensor that records muscle activity in real time. The control architecture provides the ability to automatically activate the appropriate stimulation mode based on the acquired EMG signal. The system software provides two modes for stimulation activation: the manual preset mode and the EMG driven mode. The program ensures traceability and provides the ability to issue a patient status monitoring report. Findings: The developed robotic device is symmetrical and reconfigurable. The presented rehabilitation system includes a muscle stimulator associated with the robot to improve the quality of the rehabilitation process. The integration of neuromuscular electrical stimulation into the physical rehabilitation process offers effective rehabilitation sessions for neuromuscular recovery of the upper limb. A laboratory-made stimulator is developed to generate three modes of stimulation: pain relief, massage and relaxation. Through the control software interface, the physiotherapist can set the exercise movement parameters, define the stimulation mode and record the patient training in real time. Research limitations/implications: There are certain constraints when applying the proposed method, such as the sensitivity of the acquired EMG signals. This involves the use of professional equipment and mainly the implementation of sophisticated algorithms for signal extraction. Practical implications: Functional electrical stimulation and robot-based motor rehabilitation are the most important technologies applied in post-stroke rehabilitation. The main objective of integrating robots into the rehabilitation process is to compensate for the functions lost in people with physical disabilities. The stimulation technique can be used for recovery, relaxation and drainage and pain relief. In this context, the idea is to integrate electrical stimulation into motor rehabilitation based on a robot to obtain the advantages of the two approaches to further improve the rehabilitation process. The introduction of this type of robot also makes it possible to develop new exciting assistance devices. Originality/value: The proposed design is symmetrical, reconfigurable and light, covering all the joints of the upper limbs and their movements. In addition, the developed platform is inexpensive and a portable solution based on open source hardware platforms which opens the way to more extensions and developments. Electrical stimulation is often used to improve motor function and restore loss of function. However, the main objective behind the proposed stimulation in this paper is to recover after effort. The novelty of the proposed solution is to integrate the electrical stimulation powered by EMG in robotic rehabilitation. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have found application in a broad range of domains due to their ability to massively exploit data parallelism and thereby achieve high energy efficiency, being now referred to as General-Purpose GPUs (GPGPUs). However, with a market dominated by two or three industrial players and a lack of open-source hardware realizations and standardized GPU Instruction-Set Architectures (ISAs), the full potential of these architectures for academic research and use by small hardware development enterprises remains far from being unlocked. In this paper, we start by discussing a few exciting research directions in GPGPU architectures and the benefits of open-source Hardware realizations. Furthermore, we show how our open-source FGPU core can be used to enable overcoming these challenges and contribute to the agile development of Domain-Specific Architectures (DSAs) featuring System-on-Chip (SoC) platforms extended with adapted GPGPU cores. FGPU is described in VHDL, can be programmed in OpenCL by use of our LLVM-based compiler, and has been validated against an ARM Cortex A9 with NEON support, achieving 4 performance improvement in fixed and floating-point benchmarks. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - A data visualization proposition for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is presented in this paper. WSNs play a pivotal role in the composition of Internet of Things (IoT) systems. In an IoT system, the data accumulated by nodes with distinct sensors can be used to monitor environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity. With this data, efforts can be taken to improve the comfort of people in these environments. There exist circumstances where directly connecting the data collected in the WSNs to the Internet may not always be economic efficient. Moreover, we propose a scheme that utilizes both open source hardware and software for data collection at the nodes of a WSN where it is visualized using an online IoT platform known as ThingsBoard. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - The development of light-sheet fluorescence microscopy has been a revolution for developmental biology as it allows long-term imaging during embryonic development. An important reason behind the quick adoption has been the availability of open hardware alternatives. In this work, we present a robust and compact version of a light-sheet fluorescence microscope that is easy to assemble and requires little to no maintenance. An important aspect of the design is that the illumination unit consists of reflective elements, thereby reducing chromatic aberrations an order of magnitude as compared to refractive counterparts. © 2020 Optical Society of America.

AB  - Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are distributed systems, which intensively interact with their environment, which they are seamlessly embedded into. Some CPS solutions must operate in real-time, as the embedding application is safety-critical, such as industrial control systems in Industry 4.0 applications or vehicular networks (e.g., Automotive/TSN Ethernet). The centerpiece of real-time operation is time synchronization, i.e., the nodes of the system must establish a common knowledge of time by exchanging messages over the standard communication channel. For this purpose, the IEEE 1588 protocol and its derivatives were developed. However, devices supporting IEEE 1588 are expensive for educational purposes and use closed software, making modifications for research impossible. Therefore, our larger goal is to create a low-cost IEEE 1588 master clock on an Open Hardware, Open Software basis to facilitate education and research. For this, one of the first steps is the selection of a GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System, e.g. GPS) receiver. However, this is not a straightforward task; the different receivers need to be carefully evaluated by collecting and analyzing empirical data. So, we created a measurement system to compare, analyze, and evaluate different GNSS receivers. In this paper, we introduce the measurement system improved with time measuring capabilities and describe its theory of operation. Then we present the results and conclusions of an 11-day comparison measurement between a u-blox NEO-M8T timing receiver and a low-cost Quectel L86 general-purpose receiver with timing functions (our initial choices for implementation). © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Open Science Hardware (OScH) refers to open-source alternatives for proprietary scientific equipment. While the OScH movement aims to reduce barriers for scientific experimentation both in and beyond professional labs, disseminating OScH for widespread adoption proves to be challenging in practice. To this end, we examined real-world practices related to the dissemination of OScH through a two-part study. First, we developed an open science hardware, a DIY incubator, and disseminated it through the Instructables website and maker workshops. In parallel, we interviewed eight open science hardware practitioners from different parts of the world. Insights from interviews together with our own self-reflections revealed how different OScH dissemination modalities serve unique purposes. Our findings also reveal several challenges for widespread adoption of OScH and the importance of collaborations between OScH developers. We conclude by discussing the opportunities for HCI to lower barriers for customization, support internationalization of OScH, and scaffold proactive distributed collaborations between developers and users. © 2020 ACM.

AB  - In this work, the generation and posterior chemometric resolution of third-order data, obtained from samples processed by liquid chromatography (LC) with online registering of excitation-emission fluorescence matrices (EEM) is reported. Samples were instrumentally processed in a relatively short time, and neither an intentional reduction of the linear flow rate nor an unconventional fluorescence instrument were required. Through the inclusion of external circuitry based on open-source hardware, the occurrence time of each individual fluorescence intensity reading was recorded. For the reported instrumental setup, irregular signal sampling was verified. In order to consider samples-specific time measurements, the PARAFAC (Parallel Factor Analysis) algorithm, and the derived APARAFAC (Augmented-PARAFAC) strategy, were adapted. The functional information was employed during the computational stages, through the development and implementation of smoothing strategies. To tackle differences between the rate of spectral acquisition and the rate of change in the concentration of the mobile fluorophores, Expectation Maximization was implemented. Data from samples with one calibrated analyte (Vitamin B6-Pyridoxine), in presence of uncalibrated interferents, were modeled. In order to preserve the original data structure, unfolding data operations were minimized. The resolved profiles of all species were in agreement with the corresponding chromatographic and spectral references. Results suggest that the effects derived from the loss of trilinearity previously reported in the literature for LC-EEM data, depend on interpretation and subsequent modeling of the data. The reported strategies can be useful with other flow techniques and kinetics. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Synthetic biology emerged in the USA and Europe twenty years ago and quickly developed innovative research and technology as a result of continued funding. Synthetic biology is also growing in many developing countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America, where it could have a large economic impact by helping its use of genetic biodiversity in order to boost existing industries. Starting in 2011, Argentine synthetic biology developed along an idiosyncratic path. In 2011–2012, the main focus was not exclusively research but also on community building through teaching and participation in iGEM, following the template of the early “MIT school” of synthetic biology. In 2013–2015, activities diversified and included society-centered projects, social science studies on synthetic biology and bioart. Standard research outputs such as articles and industrial applications helped consolidate several academic working groups. Since 2016, the lack of a critical mass of researchers and a funding crisis were partially compensated by establishing links with Latin American synthetic biologists and with other socially oriented open technology collectives. The TECNOx community is a central node in this growing research and technology network. The first four annual TECNOx meetings brought together synthetic biologists with other open science and engineering platforms and explored the relationship of Latin American technologies with entrepreneurship, open hardware, ethics and human rights. In sum, the socioeconomic context encouraged Latin American synthetic biology to develop in a meandering and diversifying manner. This revealed alternative ways for growth of the field that may be relevant to other developing countries. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This paper presents the design, construction, operation, and validation of a robotic gantry platform specifically designed for studying fish-robot interaction. The platform has five degrees of freedom to manipulate the three-dimensional position, yaw angle, and the pitch of a lure. Additionally, it has a four-conductor slip ring that allows power and data to be transmitted to the lure for the operation of fins and other actuators that increase realism or act as stimuli to focal fish during an ethorobotic experiment. The design is open-source, low-cost, and includes purpose-built electronics, software, and hardware to make it extensible and customizable for a number of applications with varying requirements. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Imaging underwater can be particularly problematic and expensive given the harsh environmental conditions posed by salinity and for some deployments, pressure. To counter these difficulties, expensive waterproof pressure resistant housings are often used, commonly built from expensive materials such as titanium, if intended for long duration deployments. Further, environmental investigations often benefit from replicate data collection, which additionally increases study costs. In this paper we present a new camera system, developed with off the shelf and 3D printed cost effective components for use in shallow waters of <150 m depth. Integrating Raspberry Pi Zero W microcomputers with open source design files and software, it is hoped these camera systems will be of interest to the global marine and freshwater research communities. © 2020

AB  - This article presents a prototype reference design for a low-cost miniature magnetic levitation experiment. The proposed device is built as an Arduino expansion module, thus may be installed on a broad range of microcontroller prototyping boards. The open-source hardware design uses off-the-shelf and widely available components and 3D printing technology, thus its overall material cost is minimal. This way, the magnetic levitation experiment is transformed into a pocket laboratory that can be borrowed by students for take-home experiments. In addition to the device itself, we present an open-source application programming interface and the outline of classroom examples in modeling, system identification and closed-loop control. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - An open-source precision pressure pump system and control software is presented, primarily designed for the experimental microfluidics community, although others may find additional uses for this precision pressure source. This mechatronic system is coined ‘µPump,’ and its performance rivals that of commercially available systems, at a fraction of the cost. The pressure accuracy, stability, and resolution are 0.09%, 0.02%, and 0.02% of the full span, respectively. The settling time to reach 2 bar from zero and stabilize is less than 2 s. Material for building a four-channel µPump (approx. $3000 USD) or an eight-channel µPump (approx. $5000 USD) is approximately a quarter, or a third of the cost of buying a high-end commercial system, respectively. The design rationale is presented, together with documented design details and software, so that the system may be replicated or customized to particular applications. µPump can be used for two-phase droplet microfluidics, single-phase microfluidics, gaseous flow microfluidics and any other applications requiring precise fluid handling. µPump provides researchers, students, and startups with a cost-effective solution for precise fluid control. © 2020

AB  - With the current rapid spread of COVID-19, global health systems are increasingly overburdened by the sheer number of people that need diagnosis, isolation and treatment. Shortcomings are evident across the board, from staffing, facilities for rapid and reliable testing to availability of hospital beds and key medical-grade equipment. The scale and breadth of the problem calls for an equally substantive response not only from frontline workers such as medical staff and scientists, but from skilled members of the public who have the time, facilities and knowledge to meaningfully contribute to a consolidated global response. Here, we summarise community-driven approaches based on Free and Open Source scientific and medical Hardware (FOSH) as well as personal protective equipment (PPE) currently being developed and deployed to support the global response for COVID-19 prevention, patient treatment and diagnostics.

AB  - In our modern world, many Internet of Things (IoT) technologies are being researched and developed. IoT devices are currently being used in many fields. IoT devices use Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, however, communication distance is short and battery consumption is high. In areas such as smart cities and smart farms, IoT technology is needed to support a wide coverage with low power consumption. Low Power Wide Area (LPWA), which is a transmission used in IoT supporting a wide area with low power consumption, has evolved. LPWA includes Long Range (LoRa), Narrowband (NB-IoT), and Sigfox. LoRa offers many benefits as it communicates the longest distances, is cheap and consumes less battery. LoRa is used in many countries and covers a range of hundreds of square kilometers (km2) with a single gateway. However, if there are many obstacles to smart cities and smart farms, it causes communication problems. This paper proposes two (2) solutions to this problem: the relay method which is a multi-hop method and the Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) system that detects packet loss in real-time and requests retransmission for LoRa. In this study, the actual performance of LoRa in the problematic environment was measured and the proposed method was applied. It was confirmed that the transmission rate of LoRa dropped when there were many obstacles such as trees. To use LoRa in a smart farm with a lot of space, multi-hop was observed to be better. An ARQ system is needed to compensate for the unexpected drop in the forward rate due to the increase in IoT devices. This research focused on reliability, however, additional network methods and automatic repeat request (ARQ) systems considering battery time should be researched in symmetry. This study covers the interdisciplinary field of computer science and wireless low power communication engineering. We have analyzed the LoRa/LoRaWAN technology in an experimental approach, which has been somewhat less studied than cellular network or WiFi technology. In addition, we presented and improved the performance evaluation results in consideration of various local and climatic environments. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - We show the stabilization of a chaotic oscillator circuit to an unstable, period-77 orbit using open-source hardware. Period-34 orbits have been stabilized previously in a demonstration that serves as a valuable educational resource for studying nonlinear dynamics. This experiment instructs students on the underlying nature of chaos, however, computers with relatively expensive data acquisition systems limit the experiment's accessibility. We impose upon the prevalence of open-source hardware paired with the general advancement of electronics to give a broader platform for experimentation with chaotic systems in an undergraduate laboratory setting. We aim to remove expense and add convenience to an edifying experiment that shows the inner structure of chaotic attractors as unstable, period orbits. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Heterogeneous architectures and heterogeneous-ISA designs are growing areas of computer architecture and system software research. Unfortunately, this line of research is significantly hindered by the lack of experimental systems and modifiable hardware frameworks. This work proposes BYOC, a "Bring Your Own Core" framework that is specifically designed to enable heterogeneous-ISA and heterogeneous system research. BYOC is an open-source hardware framework that provides a scalable cache coherence system, that includes out-of-the-box support for four different ISAs (RISC-V 32-bit, RISC-V 64-bit, x86, and SPARCv9) and has been connected to ten different cores. The framework also supports multiple loosely coupled accelerators and is a fully working system supporting SMP Linux. The Transaction-Response Interface (TRI) introduced with BYOC has been specifically designed to make it easy to add in new cores with new ISAs and memory interfaces. This work demonstrates multiple multi-ISA designs running on FPGA and characterises the communication costs. This work describes many of the architectural design trade-offs for building such a flexible system. BYOC is well suited to be the premiere platform for heterogeneous-ISA architecture, system software, and compiler research. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - This article presents a methodology to recycle and upgrade a 4-DOF educational robot manipulator with a gripper. The robot is upgraded by providing it an artificial vision that allows obtaining the position and shape of objects collected by it. A low-cost and open-source hardware solution is also proposed to achieve motion control of the robot through a decentralized control scheme. The robot joints are actuated through five direct current motors coupled to optical encoders. Each encoder signal is fed to a proportional integral derivative controller with anti-windup that employs the motor velocity provided by a state observer. The motion controller works with only two open-architecture Arduino Mega boards, which carry out data acquisition of the optical encoder signals. MATLAB-Simulink is used to implement the controller as well as a friendly graphical interface, which allows the user to interact with the manipulator. The communication between the Arduino boards and MATLAB-Simulink is performed in real-time utilizing the Arduino IO Toolbox. Through the proposed controller, the robot follows a trajectory to collect a desired object, avoiding its collision with other objects. This fact is verified through a set of experiments presented in the paper. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Tissue decellularization for generating extracellular matrices has become a staple of regenerative medicine in the recent decades, extending from the research setting to clinical usage. Although methods and protocols for tissue decellularization are abundant throughout the literature, they can be time intensive and typically require specific overhead in terms of equipment. To reduce these barriers to entry, a functional and reproducible prototype of a tissue infusion/perfusion device (TIPD) has been designed and fabricated using three-dimensional printed parts in conjunction with commercially available components. This TIPD forms a system composed of two peristaltic pumps, two 3-way valves, and a chamber in which tissue is contained, and is controlled by user-customizable software. To increase repeatability among decellularization protocols, an automation function has been integrated into the software, which is able to specify fluid flow rates and define specific valve locations enabling selection of solutions to be introduced into a scaffold over the course of a decellularization process. The prototype has been tested for proof of concept through infusion and perfusion decellularization of skeletal muscle and intact kidneys, respectively, and has shown successful removal of cellular content while maintaining an intact ultrastructure. In an effort to increase the reproducibility of experimental designs and to promote an open source hardware initiative in the field of tissue engineering, a novel device was conceptualized and prototyped with printable part files made available for its fabrication in tandem with instructions for assembly. Repeatable methods for decellularization are essential for achieving consistent substrates between batches, laboratories, and facilities. To meet this end, an automatable tissue infusion/perfusion device composed of three-dimensional printed parts and commercially available components has been prototyped and tested. Materials and instructions for its assembly have been made available in an effort to reduce variability among equipment as well as to provide a platform on which to iterate open-source hardware in tissue engineering. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - A new open-hardware bioreactor capable of applying electrical field stimulation in conjunction with static or cyclic stretch is presented. Stretch is applied to cells by a specially designed elastomeric membrane with a central seeding region. The main interest of our approach is the fine control of the characteristics of stimulations in regard to timing and amplitude in a simple design based on affordable, easy to find components and 3D printable parts. Our approach opens the way to more complex protocols for electrical and/or mechanical stimulations, which are known important regulators of cardiac phenotypes. © 2020 Author(s).

AB  - Abstract: An open-source syringe pump has been developed for use in the analytical laboratory. Most pump parts are made on a 3D printer. Other parts (lead screw, guide rods, stepper motor, bearings, electronic components) are purchased in specialized stores. The control panel is based on the Arduino UNO. Device interaction, any settings changes, and operating mode selection are carried out using the LCD Keypad Shield (no computer connection required). The program for the microcontroller is written in Arduino IDE. Assembling the syringe pump takes several hours and requires almost no soldering. Universal clamp allows installing any syringe with a diameter of 6 to 25 mm. The syringe pump can both infuse the liquid and refill the empty syringe. To evaluate the analytical characteristics, a 10-mL glass syringe (Kloehn) was used. The dispensed volume was 1 and 5 mL. The systematic error was less than 0.1%, and the random one was less than 3 μL.

AB  - Robust and accurate pose estimation is crucial for many applications in mobile robotics. Extending visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) with other modalities such as an inertial measurement unit (IMU) can boost robustness and accuracy. However, for a tight sensor fusion, accurate time synchronization of the sensors is often crucial. Changing exposure times, internal sensor filtering, multiple clock sources and unpredictable delays from operation system scheduling and data transfer can make sensor synchronization challenging. In this paper, we present VersaVIS, an Open Versatile Multi-Camera Visual-Inertial Sensor Suite aimed to be an efficient research platform for easy deployment, integration and extension for many mobile robotic applications. VersaVIS provides a complete, open-source hardware, firmware and software bundle to perform time synchronization of multiple cameras with an IMU featuring exposure compensation, host clock translation and independent and stereo camera triggering. The sensor suite supports a wide range of cameras and IMUs to match the requirements of the application. The synchronization accuracy of the framework is evaluated on multiple experiments achieving timing accuracy of less than 1 ms. Furthermore, the applicability and versatility of the sensor suite is demonstrated in multiple applications including visual-inertial SLAM, multi-camera applications, multi-modal mapping, reconstruction and object based mapping. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Accurate building energy assessments are often limited by inaccurate assumptions about the buildings' properties and occupant behavior. Many assessment methods use assumptions instead of measured data because it is cumbersome, time-intensive, and cost-intensive to acquire up-to-date, on-site measured data. This work bridges this gap by presenting the design of an open-source, wireless sensor network (WSN) that is easy to program, manufacture, modify, and deploy. The version of the WSN presented here measures air temperature, relative humidity, supply and return temperature of hot water from the heating system and the radiators, heat flux through the walls and the windows, luminosity, oil flow, electricity, window opening times, and CO2-concentration. The modularity of the WSN allows it to be extended with the addition of new types of sensors to the existing hardware framework. The data is streamed to an online database, allowing monitoring of the measurements in near real-time. The cost and performance of the sensor network are intended to be as good as or better than the existing solutions. The current cost for one temperature sensor node starts at 116 USD. The observed battery lifetime reaches up to a year for a five-minute sampling interval. The average installation time for a sensor node is 7 min. We describe the hardware architecture, software architecture, cost of the WSN, along with results from co-location tests, and a deployment in an occupied building. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Currently, there are different contexts of application where IoT can be applied such as: early warning systems, precision agriculture, monitoring of physiological variables, among others. Taking into account the above, the diversity of proprietary and open hardware and software technologies, it is necessary to have in academic environments a platform that makes it possible to generalize the development and facilitate integration of the layers of data visualization, capture, storage and analysis. This paper proposes as a contribution a portable academic platform for the construction of microservices in IoT environments. The proposed platform makes use of open hardware and software tools such as: JavaScript JQuery library, Python Flask framework, MongoDB, Raspberry PI and Arduino. This platform aims to guide different academic projects that involve rapid deployment and implementation of microservices for different application contexts associated with IoT. © 2020, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao.

AB  - At present, the Internet of Things (IoT) theme has been disseminated in different application contexts. In the particular case of domotics and immotics, the use of technologies associated with IoT allows the safety, control and automation of different types of buildings. In spite of the above, given the diversity of technologies and considering that the commercial systems used in this context make use of proprietary technologies that are costly to use in academic contexts, it is therefore necessary to design and build alternative IoT systems, supported by free hardware and software technologies that allow experimentation and the construction of value-added services. In this article we propose as a main contribution the reference architecture of an IoT system for building control, making use of free technologies. Finally, a scale prototype obtained from the proposed architecture is presented. © 2020, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao. All rights reserved.

AB  - The founding of the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS) vision was originally presented in U.S. Geological Survey Circular 1188 (U.S. Geological Survey [USGS], 1999), after many years of discussions and workshops, described in detail by Filson and Arabasz (2016). Much has been accomplished in the ensuing two decades. Disparate and sometimes divergent developments that had been previously explored at individual private and public universities were finally centralized with increased efficiency and coherency of effort. The stated mission of the ANSS is to "... provide accurate and timely data and information products for seismic events, including their effects on buildings and structures, employing modern monitoring methods and technologies."In this article, an approach (xQuake) is proposed that does not interfere in any way with the mission of the National Earthquake Information Center and ANSS but instead restores much of the community focus and international collaboration that has been lost over the past two decades. xQuake uses an executable graph framework in a pipeline architecture; this framework can be seamlessly integrated into current ANSS quake monitoring systems. This newapproach incorporatesmodern approaches to computer analytics, includingmultitopic Kafka exchange rings, cloud computing, a self-configuring phase associator, and machine learning. The xGraph system is free for noncommercial use, open source, hardware agnostic (Windows, Linux, Mac), with no requirement for commercial datastores. © Seismological Society of America.

AB  - With the global electricity demand witnessing a 3.1 percent jump in 2017, there is an increasing need for incorporating intermittent renewable energy sources and other alternative supply/demand management strategies into the supply grid networks. Short-term load forecasting models enable prediction of future power consumption, thereby encouraging shifting of loads and optimizing the use of stochastic power sources and stored energy. To make the electric grid system smart and sustainable, two-way communication between the utility and consumers must be set up and the working equipment must respond digitally to the quickly changing electric demand. The proposed work exploits the power of embedded systems to design a low-cost solution for interconnecting electrical and electronic devices, controlled by the intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) paradigms. This work primarily focuses on implementing standard regression and machine learning-based architectures for smart grid load analysis and forecasting. A state of the art ecosystem for a portable load forecasting device is proposed by means of low-cost, open-source hardware that is experimentally found to be functioning with a high degree of accuracy. Further, the performance of the classical and advanced machine learning models, emulated on the device, are analyzed on the basis of various parameters, including error percentage, execution time, CPU core temperatures, and resource utilization. Overall impressive performance is demonstrated by some specific machine learning models which are considered to be suitable for the proposed framework. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This work presents InfiniWolf, a novel multi-sensor smartwatch that can achieve self-sustainability exploiting thermal and solar energy harvesting, performing computationally high demanding tasks. The smartwatch embeds both a System-on-Chip (SoC) with an ARM Cortex-M processor and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Mr. Wolf, an open-hardware RISC-V based parallel ultra-low-power processor that boosts the processing capabilities on board by more than one order of magnitude, while also increasing energy efficiency. We demonstrate its functionality based on a sample application scenario performing stress detection with multi-layer artificial neural networks on a wearable multi-sensor bracelet. Experimental results show the benefits in terms of energy efficiency and latency of Mr. Wolf over an ARM Cortex-M4F micro-controllers and the possibility, under specific assumptions, to be self-sustainable using thermal and solar energy harvesting while performing up to 24 stress classifications per minute in indoor conditions. © 2020 EDAA.

AB  - With technologies rapidly evolving, many research institutions are now opting to invest in costly, high-quality, specialized microscopes which are shared by many researchers. As a consequence, the user may not have the ability to adapt a microscope to their specific needs and limitations in experimental design are introduced. A flexible work-horse microscopy system is a valuable tool in any laboratory to meet the diverse needs of a research team and promote innovation in experimental design. We have developed the Flexiscope; a multi-functional, adaptable, efficient and high-performance microscopy/electrophysiology system for everyday applications in a neurobiology laboratory. The core optical components are relatively constant in the three configurations described here: an upright configuration, an inverted configuration and an upright/electrophysiology configuration. We have provided a comprehensive description of the Flexiscope. We show that this method is capable of oblique infrared illumination imaging, multi-channel fluorescent imaging and automated three-dimensional scanning of larger specimens. Image quality is conserved across the three configurations of the microscope, and conversion between configurations is possible quickly and easily, while the motion control system can be repurposed to allow sub-micrometre computer-controlled micromanipulation. The Flexiscope provides similar performance and usability to commercially available systems. However, as it can be easily reconfigured for multiple roles, it can remove the need to purchase multiple microscopes, giving significant cost savings. The modular reconfigurable nature allows the user to customize the system to their specific needs and adapt/upgrade the system as challenges arise, without requiring specialized technical skills. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - The control of refrigeration in the food chain is fundamental at all stages, with special emphasis on the retail stage. The implementation of information and communication technologies (IoT, open-source hardware and software, cloud computing, etc.) is representing a revolution in the operational paradigm of food control. This paper presents a low-cost IoT solution, based on free hardware and software, for monitoring the temperature in refrigerated retail cabinets. Specifically, the use of the ESP-8266-Wi-Fi microcontroller with DS18B20 temperature sensors is proposed. The ThingSpeak IoT platform is used to store and process data in the cloud. The solution presented is robust, affordable, and flexible, allowing to extend the scope of supervising other relevant parameters in the operating process (light control, energy efficiency, consumer presence, etc.). © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Increased penetration levels of renewable energy and other types of distributed energy resources (DERs) on the modern electric grid-combined with technological advancements for electric system monitoring and control-introduce new cyberattack vectors and increase the cyberattack surface of energy systems. According to the IEEE Std. 1547-2018, DERs must use Modbus, Distributed Network Protocol 3 (DNP3), or Smart Energy Profile 2.0 (SEP2) as their communication protocol. Previous research identified several vulnerabilities and security breaches in each one of these communication protocols; despite this, existing standards for DERs do not recommend cybersecurity measures. In order to reduce vulnerabilities in power distribution systems, this paper presents a novel open-source hardware security module that improves both information and operational security to better protect data and communications on the distribution grid. The security hardware is called 'module for operational technology, ' or simply Module-OT, and it has been validated and tested in an emulated distribution system application. Module-OT is integrated within a communication system in the transport layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. It improves system security through encryption, authentication, authorization, certificate management, and user access control. The main advancement of Module-OT is the addition of hardware cryptographic acceleration that improves the overall communication performance in terms of end-to-end latency. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Digital radiography devices are still the gold standard for diagnosis or therapy guidance in medicine. Despite the similarities between all direct digital X-ray systems, researchers and new companies face significant challenges during the development phase of innovative X-ray devices; each component is manufactured independently, guidance towards device integration from manufacturers is limited, global standards for device integration is lacking. Method: In scope of this study a plug-integrate-play (PIP) conceptual model for X-ray imaging system is introduced and implemented as an open hardware platform, SyncBox. The researchers are free to select each individual device component from different vendors based on their intended application and target performance are utilized in criteria. Result: As its first implementation, SyncBox and its platform a full body high resolution radiographic scanner that employs a novel TDI digital detector. Conclusion: We believe that SyncBox has a potential for introducing an open source hardware platform to X-ray equipment design. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Nowadays Open Source platforms has become very popular to test and implement various home automation and IoT based projects as it provides the designer with a physical programmable circuit board and one corresponding Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which plays on your personal computer and is used to write, compile and upload the code on to the circuit board, thus resulting as a complete package and a great choice for beginners. To keep track with the changing world, IoT and open source platforms is becoming a part and parcel of our day to day lives at an increasingly fast pace. This paper is mainly aimed at elaborating the role of Internet of Things and Open Source platform in implementing home automation with the help of an application that will control appliances based on the room temperature and humidity readings. Here we have used Arduino Uno and ESP8266 NodeMCU open source platform for implementing the project. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.

AB  - The success of the emerging open-source hardware ecosystem critically depends on thoroughly tested open-source hardware blocks. Unfortunately, it is challenging to adopt traditional closed-source hardware testing approaches in the open-source hardware community. To tackle these challenges, we introduce PyH2, our vision for a productive and open-source testing methodology for open-source hardware. Leveraging PyMTL3, pytest, and hypothesis, PyH2 attempts to reduce the designers&#x2019; effort in creating high-quality property-based random tests. This paper introduces and quantitatively evaluates the benefits of three PyH2 frameworks: PyH2G for design generators, PyH2P for processors, and PyH2O for testing hardware with object-oriented interfaces.

AB  - Smart metering and direct load control at the individual consumer level are essential for the proper operation of smart grids. Different approaches have been proposed in the literature to address these problems. However, these approaches are not cost-effective, open-source and lack direct load control. In this paper, we propose cost-effective, open hardware-based smart meter monitoring and controlling system to monitor and control individual consumer using Internet of Things (IoT). We developed a smart meter based on a Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol, which helps to continuously monitor the individual consumer’s consumption and to log the use at server using publish-subscribe architecture. The proposed smart meter is capable of controlling the supply to the consumer based on the commands from the server with an additional feature of meter tamper detection. To monitor consumption and billing information of the consumer, an android application was developed. The prototype of the proposed system is built using open-source hardware components, and various test conditions are applied to validate the proposed method of approach. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has seen a surge in development of Open Source Hardware, especially open source ventilators. Many of these open source ventilator projects have adopted an open-when-finished model due to legitimate legal and liability concerns. This, however, has led to a proliferation of projects with teams across the world independently designing over a hundred mutually incompatible ventilators, representing a huge amount of duplicated effort. A functioning design is necessary but not sufficient for a project to help patients. The device must be taken through regulatory approval by a manufacturer that understands why design decisions were taken. In this article we argue that the open design process developed for Open Source Software can be used for Open Source Hardware. This process not only allows remote teams to work together improving a single design, it also provides the rich history of design decisions that manufacturers need to take the device through regulatory approval. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - The engagement of an online user community has been reported to be critical in the success of open design projects. However, most studies don't consider the financial organizational contexts of their samples. Grounded in comparative case studies of the two biggest 3D printer communities - one supported by volunteers, another by a commercial firm, the paper contributes to the open design and open hardware literature with a typology of user community actions. We measured the types and intensity of different user community activities over time for the two cases. Results confirm that user community activities behave differently in profitseeking or non-profit-seeking organizational contexts. We grounded potential causes through management team interviews as well as existing research theories. We conclude that the forprofit organizational context is associated with a difference in the design maturation process and the evolution of organizational openness. © 2020 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

AB  - Knowledge management (KM) is the process of creating, sharing, using and managing the knowledge and information of an organization. In this paper, we investigate KM practices and needs in Open Source Hardware (OSH) communities. The aim is to provide insights into the KM issues and challenges facing these communities. Our analysis is based on interviews carried out with the participants of 22 projects. Interview transcriptions were coded and tagged with concepts extracted from the literature. Text mining was used to uncover the main concepts embedded in the corpus. From this analysis, knowledge sharing emerged as one of the top-rated concepts. Codification and personalization also proved to be important KM approaches, both requiring support in the OSH design process. Using a dendrogram, we highlighted the benefits and challenges of codification together with some interesting concept associations. High contributor turnover, little or no standardization and weak project structuring are still key challenges for OSH communities when it comes to ensuring awareness, making decisions and sharing knowledge. © The Author(s), 2020.

AB  - We present a sample implementation of a Virtual and Augmented Reality immersive environment based on Free and Libre Open Source Hardware and Software and the HTC Vive system, used to enhance the immersive experience of the user and to track her/his movements. The sense of immersion has increased and stimulated using a footplate and a Tibetan bridge, connected to the virtual world as Augmented Reality applications and implemented through an Arduino board, thereby adopting a low cost, open source hardware and software approach. The proposed architecture is relatively affordable from the cost point of view, easy to implement, configure and adapt to different contexts. It can be of great help for organizing laboratory classes for young students to afford the implementation of virtual worlds and Augmented Reality applications. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The internet of things is rapidly becoming a fact of life. There remain, however, various challenges with respect to the concept of Industry 4.0 before this new reality is fully integrated into the industrial sector. One such challenge is ensuring security, an essential issue in terms of both management and operational technology involving the configuration and administration of physical equipment. Another is integrating equipment from different manufacturers which must be configured and/or administered with incompatible protocols. Likewise, remote access to systems must be carried out from a browser in the web frame. This paper presents a set of tools, available as a cloud-based service, which facilitates access to the physical equipment located in a business. The access enables the end user to see and/or modify the configuration and management of data in a secure, controlled, organized and collaborative manner. In order to unify different protocols, the service makes use of the Modbus TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) protocol, one of the most commonly used by industry in local networks. The local Modbus communications are encapsulated in the Websocket protocol to make them accessible from the cloud. The tools proposed in this paper are based on open hardware platforms and free software, and they permit local and remote sensors and actuators to be fully and easily accessed. Hence, their chief advantage is that they allow access from any internet connection, via a browser, to the physical equipment located in an industry by means of user profiles in accordance with the security level set by each individual company. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - NVMe is widely used by diverse types of storage and nonvolatile memories subsystems as a de-facto fast I/O communication interface. Industries secure their own intellectual property (IP) for high-speed NVMe controllers and explore challenges of software stack with future fast NVMe storage cards. Unfortunately, such NVMe controller IPs are often inaccessible to academia. The research community, however, requires an open-source hardware framework to build new storage stack and controllers for the fast NVMe devices. In this work, we present OpenExpress, a fully hardware automated framework that has no software intervention to process concurrent NVMe requests while supporting scalable data submission, rich outstanding I/O command queues, and submission/completion queue management. OpenExpress is available to download and offers a maximum bandwidth of around 7GB/s without a silicon fabrication. Copyright © Proc. of the 2020 USENIX Annual Technical Conference, ATC 2020.

AB  - The laboratory equipment is commonly expensive, making its acquisition difficult for laboratories and universities with low budgets. This problem could be solved with the use of open source software and hardware. Last decade, different initiatives were born that promulgate the use of these technologies for the design and construction of low-cost devices. Two of these initiatives, Arduino project and Raspberry Pi project, could be used for the design of sensors, loggers, and machines useful for a rock mechanics laboratory. Two examples of these technologies are a very low-cost strain-gauge logger and a control mechanism for a tilt test machine. These two devices have been designed, manufactured, and tested. Their performance satisfies the needs of a rock mechanics laboratory, proving the utility of these open source initiatives for this purpose. © 2020 ISRM.

AB  - Obstacle avoidance is an essential feature for autonomous robots. It is usually addressed with specialized sensors and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping algorithms (SLAM, Cadena et al. (2016)). Muller et al. (2006) have demonstrated that it can also be addressed using end-to-end deep learning. They proposed a convolutional neural network that maps raw stereo pair input images to steering outputs and is trained by a human driver in an outdoor setting. Using the ToyCollect open source hardware and software platform, we replicate their main findings, compare several variants of their network that differ in the way steering angles are represented, and extend their system to indoor obstacle avoidance. We discuss several issues for further work concerning the automated generation of training data and the quantitative evaluation of such systems. © 2020 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

AB  - We propose an open source hardware platform called Blinky, a sound-to-light conversion sensor that harvests sound power at low-rate and conveniently. Blinkies are made up of a central processing unit connected to two microphones and a few light-emitting devices, are powered by a battery, and protected by a robust enclosure. Distributed in space and combined with a conventional video camera, they allow to practically sense sound power over a very large area without hassle. We give a comprehensive overview of the proposed system and its potential applications. We describe the hardware design and trade-offs made. We provide a model for the channel between sound power measurements and signal acquired by the video camera. Because each sensor is potentially affected by a different attenuation due to the channel, we propose a calibration procedure to restore the scale of the measurements. The effectiveness of the calibration is validated in an experiment. Finally, we demonstrate sound source localization using a hundred-and-one actual Blinkies in highly reverberent environment. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The increased popularity of investigations and exploits in the fields of neurological rehabilitation, human emotion recognition, and other relevant brain-computer interfaces demand the need for flexible electrophysiology data acquisition systems. Such systems often require to be multi-modal and multi-channel capable of acquiring and processing several different types of physiological signals simultaneously in real-time. Developments of modular and scalable electrophysiological data acquisition systems for experimental research enhance understanding and progress in the field. To contribute to such an endeavor, we present an open-source hardware project called High-Channel Count Electrophysiology or HiCCE, targeting to produce an easily-adaptable, cost-effective, and affordable electrophysiological acquisition system as an alternative solution for mostly available commercial tools and the current state of the art in the field. In this paper, we describe the design and validation of the entire chain of the HiCCE-128 electrophysiological data acquisition system. The system comprises of 128 independent channels capable of acquiring signal at 31.25 kHz, with 16 effective bits per channel with a measured noise level of about 3μV. The reliability and feasibility of the implemented system have been confirmed through a series of tests and real-world applications. The modular design methodology based on the FPGA Mezzanine Card (FMC) standard allows the connection of the HiCCE-128 board to programmable system-on-chip carrier devices through the high-speed FMC link. The implemented architecture enables end users to add various high-response electrophysiological signal processing techniques in the field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) part of the system on chip (SoC) device on each channel in parallel according to application specification. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - This article proposes a feature-rich, open hardware, open software inexpensive robot based on a Waveshare AlphaBot 2. The proposal uses a Raspberry Pi and a chrome plated light bulb as a mirror to produce a robot with an omnidirectional vision (catadioptric) system. The system also tackles boot and network issues to allow for monitor-less programming and usage, thus further reducing usage costs. The OpenCV library is used for image processing and obstacles are identified based on their brightness and saturation in contrast to the ground. Our solution achieved acceptable framerates and near perfect object detection up to 1.5-m distances. The robot is usable for simple robotic demonstrations and educational purposes for its simplicity and flexibility. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Open-source designs are being increasingly used to develop robot hardware. When motor actuators were used for robot development in the past, it was difficult to find cost-effective commercial products. Open-source motor controllers, recently developed with the collaboration of many people, have exhibited phenomenal growth as their performance is now comparable to those of commercial products and their price is cheaper. In this study, we utilized an open-source Vedder electronic speed controller (VESC), originally developed for electric skateboards, as a general-purpose motor controller for robot control. The high-speed, high-torque, and high-output VESC was hardware-upgraded to enable more accurate current control, and advanced position and speed control algorithms were developed to produce Myongji-VESC (MJ-VESC), a general-purpose motor controller for multiaxis robot systems. To evaluate its current, speed, and position control performances, MJ-VESC was applied to an open-source planetary geared actuator that can be fabricated with a 3D printer. Based on this, we propose an open-source motor controller framework that can be universally used for multiaxis robot systems. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Recent advancements in whole slide imaging (WSI) have moved pathology closer to digital practice. Existing systems require precise mechanical control, and the cost is prohibitive for most individual pathologists. Here we report a low-cost and high-throughput WSI system termed OpenWSI. The reported system is built using off-the-shelf components, including a programmable LED array, a photographic lens, and a low-cost computer numerical control (CNC) router. Different from conventional WSI platforms, our system performs real-time single-frame autofocusing using color-multiplexed illumination. For axial positioning control, we perform coarse adjustment using the CNC router and precise adjustment using the ultrasonic motor ring in the photographic lens. By using a 20X objective lens, we show that the OpenWSI system has a resolution of ∼0.7 μm. It can acquire whole slide images of a 225 mm2 region in ∼2 mins with throughput comparable to existing high-end platforms. The reported system offers a turnkey solution to transform the high-end WSI platforms into one that can be made broadly available and utilizable without loss of capacity. © 2019 Optical Society of America.

AB  - This paper presents a fuzzy inference system and microcontroller-based protection scheme for a combined underground (UG) cable and overhead (OH) transmission line system. The scheme detects, classifies, and locates the fault occurring either in an UG cable or OH transmission line network. Furthermore, the scheme identifies the faulty section. An existing Indian power network i.e., real power system network of C.G. state, consisting of 132 kV, 50 Hz power transmission network connecting Doma substation 220/132 kV to the 132/33 kV Gas Insulated Substation Rawanbhata through combined transmission network is considered. This real power transmission network is simulated by using MATLAB/Simulink software. In this paper, the hardware implementation is also carried out using an open-source hardware, Arduino, which consists of an Atmel 8-bit AVR microcontroller. Both the simulation and hardware results validate that the proposed scheme is accurately detecting, classifying, and locating the fault in less than a half cycle time. Moreover, the percentage error in determining the location of a fault is less than 0.7%. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Recently, the passive seismic techniques based on the microtremor measurements have emerged as an alternative to conventional seismic and geotechnical methods used in engineering seismology and earthquake engineering, especially in the local site effect investigations. These methods are basically based on the recording of seismic ambient noise and analysis of its spectral features. Although these techniques are more practical than traditional seismic methods, the commercial instruments designed for recording the seismic ambient noise are quite expensive. Furthermore, most of these instruments require an external computer for recording and monitoring the data. In this sense, this paper intends to present a low-cost and Raspberry Pi single-board microcomputer aided seismic ambient noise recording and monitoring system (RaspMI) as an alternative to the computer aided commercial seismic noise measurement systems. RaspMI is an open-source hardware and software system that is controlled by a graphical user interface developed by using the MonoDevelop cross-platform and C# programming language. This system has many features such as 72 dB dynamic range, 100 Hz sampling frequency, timer recording mode, text and SAC data file format, and latitude, longitude, date and time support with GPS module. RaspMI has subjected to the various tests in terms of the reliability and sensitivity. The obtained results have shown that RaspMI can be used as an alternative instrument for seismic ambient noise measurements. IEEE

AB  - This book is about the Arduino microcontroller and the Arduino concept. The visionary Arduino team of Massimo Banzi, David Cuartielles, Tom Igoe, Gianluca Martino, and David Mellis launched a new innovation in microcontroller hardware in 2005, the concept of open-source hardware. Their approach was to openly share details of microcontroller-based hardware design platforms to stimulate the sharing of ideas and promote innovation. This concept has been popular in the software world for many years. In June 2019, Joel Claypool and I met to plan the fourth edition of Arduino Microcontroller Processing for Everyone! Our goal has been to provide an accessible book on the rapidly changing world of Arduino for a wide variety of audiences including students of the fine arts, middle and senior high school students, engineering design students, and practicing scientists and engineers. To make the book more accessible to better serve our readers, we decided to change our approach and provide a series of smaller volumes. Each volume is written to a specific audience. This book, Arduino I: Getting Started is written for those looking for a quick tutorial on the Arduino environment, platforms, interface techniques, and applications. Arduino II will explore advanced techniques, applications, and systems design. Arduino III will explore Arduino applications in the Internet of Things (IoT). Arduino I: Getting Started covers three different Arduino products: the Arduino UNO R3 equipped with the Microchip ATmega328, the Arduino Mega 2560 equipped with the Microchip ATmega2560, and the wearable Arduino LilyPad. © 2020 by Morgan & Claypool.

AB  - Nowadays, the world is experiencing many changes, the technology is conquered by open hardware movement and the competition is based mainly on the development of ground-breaking products. These technological and economical changes are pushing companies to reinvent themselves to develop products that are cheaper, better and of good quality than competitors. An appealing avenue for these companies is to use open hardware solutions in the development of their new products. However, product development processes used nowadays are not suited to exploit the full potential of open hardware. This work addresses this issue by first performing an in-depth assessment of the academic literature on product innovation processes and later proposing a product development process based on open technologies. The process introduces a new product development rationale that includes four phases: the first phase is looking for opportunities, which involves generating opportunities and creative ideas. The second phase is the opportunity assessment phase, which consists of selecting and capturing opportunities. The third phase is the validation of opportunities phase through technical feasibility, client desirability and sustainability. The fourth phase is engineering design, which includes concept generation, prototyping testing, and product manufacturing. The developed process hopes to open the way for businesses, especially in emerging countries like Morocco, to be competitive on the market by helping them designing superior products based on open technologies. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Repeat observations underpin our understanding of environmental processes, but financial constraints often limit scientists’ ability to deploy dense networks of conventional commercial instrumentation. Rapid growth in the Internet-Of-Things (IoT) and the maker movement is paving the way for low-cost electronic sensors to transform global environmental monitoring. Accessible and inexpensive sensor construction is also fostering exciting opportunities for citizen science and participatory research. Drawing on 6 years of developmental work with Arduino-based open-source hardware and software, extensive laboratory and field testing, and incorporation of such technology into active research programmes, we outline a series of successes, failures and lessons learned in designing and deploying environmental sensors. Six case studies are presented: a water table depth probe, air and water quality sensors, multi-parameter weather stations, a time-sequencing lake sediment trap, and a sonic anemometer for monitoring sand transport. Schematics, code and purchasing guidance to reproduce our sensors are described in the paper, with detailed build instructions hosted on our King’s College London Geography Environmental Sensors Github repository and the FreeStation project website. We show in each case study that manual design and construction can produce research-grade scientific instrumentation (mean bias error for calibrated sensors –0.04 to 23%) for a fraction of the conventional cost, provided rigorous, sensor-specific calibration and field testing is conducted. In sharing our collective experiences with build-it-yourself environmental monitoring, we intend for this paper to act as a catalyst for physical geographers and the wider environmental science community to begin incorporating low-cost sensor development into their research activities. The capacity to deploy denser sensor networks should ultimately lead to superior environmental monitoring at the local to global scales. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - In the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem, sensors and actuators represent the edge that is the source of data. The amount of data being generated by edge devices is exploding. Storage and processing of all the data in the cloud has become too slow and costly to meet the requirements of the end user. Edge computing presents a substantial solution through facilitating the processing of device data closer to the source. However, computing data from various and different sources is a formidable challenge for edge programming. This abstract presents lab experiments for testing versions of a multi-purpose generic edge engine on open-hardware edge devices, specifically the Raspbersry Pi 3 as a test bed with a standard Operating System (OS) and the STMxx as an MCU with Real-Time Operating System (RTOS). © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Phase microscopy allows stain-free imaging of transparent biological samples. One technique, using the transport of intensity equation (TIE), can be performed without dedicated hardware by simply processing pairs of images taken at known spacings within the sample. The resulting TIE images are quantitative phase maps of unstained biological samples. Therefore, spatially resolved optical path length (OPL) information can also be determined. Using low-cost, open-source hardware, we applied the TIE to living algal cells to measure their effect on OPL. We obtained OPL values that were repeatable within species and differed by distinct amounts depending on the species being measured. We suggest TIE imaging as a method of discrimination between different algal species and, potentially, non-biological materials, based on refractive index/OPL. Potential applications in biogeochemical modelling and climate sciences are suggested. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - In ARM TrustZone-based architecture, shared memory is one of the most useful schemes to enable isolated execution environments supported by TrustZone to communicate between environments. However, it is already known that shared memory is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks since mechanisms to check integrity or authenticate callers for the shared memory payload are not supported in TrustZone. While an encryption-based method that resolves this limitation does exist, there are some architectural limitations. Indeed, even with key protection countermeasures applied, there is a risk that encryption keys may be leaked, as they are placed in insecure user memory during communication. Moreover, countermeasures for key leakage cause system performance overhead. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and secure scheme for shared memory, called Software One-Time Programmable Memory (SOTPM). SOTPM is a software-implemented, one-time programmable shared memory. It is based on the idea that payload encryption in the shared memory layer is unnecessary because sensitive data is already encrypted in the application layer before being written to the shared memory. SOTPM is set to read-only after data is written into SOTPM due to the one-time programmable characteristic. Therefore, attackers are unable to manipulate content in SOTPM during communication. Since it is not necessary for SOTPM to encrypt the payload in order to prevent malicious payload manipulation, it is possible to remove the risk of key leakage posed in previous studies. Additionally, in contrast with the existing method, our method can dramatically reduce system performance overhead. We implemented our prototype on an open-source hardware board with an Armv8-A processor and performed a security analysis and performance evaluation. The results show that SOTPM provides a sufficient level of security and less than 1% performance overhead, implying that SOTPM is a reasonable solution for current commercial products. CCBY

AB  - This article presents the realization of a low-cost wearable sensor system and its Python-based software that can measure and record relative head-torso angle, especially in sagittal plane. The system is mainly developed to track head-torso angle during walk in a clinical study. The open-hardware part of the system is composed of a pair of triaxial digital accelerometers, a microprocessor, a Bluetooth module and a rechargeable battery unit. The reception of the transmitted acceleration data, visualization, interactive sensor alignment, angle estimation and data-logging are realized by the developed open-source graphical user interface. The system is tested on a tripod for verification and on a subject for practical demonstration. Developed system can be constructed and used for ambulatory monitoring and analysis of relative head-torso angle. Open-source user interface can be downloaded and developed for further (different) algorithms and device hardware. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Physical robot platforms are an important tool in swarm robotics research, allowing algorithms to be validated and optimised under realistic conditions. The Kilobot is a widely used platform that was originally designed to be cheap and simple enough for research labs to produce themselves. However, existing designs are neither truly open-source nor amenable to repair. We present a revised Kilobot hardware design that specifically aids repair via hand-soldering while remaining compatible with previous designs. Our design was produced using open-source ECAD (Electronic Computer-Aided Design) software, and is freely available online. We hope that the editable schematic and printed circuit board (PCB) design will be of use to future Kilobot projects, and will contribute to the accessibility of swarm robotics in general. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The constant growth of the Internet, driven by the demand for timely access to data center networks has meant that the technological platforms necessary to achieve this purpose are outside the current budgets. In this order to make and validate relevant, timely and relevant contributions, it is necessary that a wider community, access to evaluation, experimentation and demonstration environments with specifications that can be compared with existing networking solutions. This article introduces the NetFPGA, which is a platform to develop network hardware for reconfigurable and rapid prototyping. It introduces the application areas in high-performance networks, advantages for traffic analysis, packet flow, hardware acceleration, power consumption and parallel processing in real time. Likewise, it presents the advantages of the platform for research, education, innovation, and future trends of this platform. Finally, we present a performance evaluation of the tool called OSNT (Open-Source Network Tester) and shows that OSNT has 95% accuracy of timestamp with resolution of 10ns for the generation of TCP traffic, and 90% efficiency capturing packets at 10Gbps of full line-rate. © 2006-2020 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).

AB  - Purpose: Existing wheelchair (WC) designs lack independent toilet accessibility, transferability and indoor manoeuvrability combined in a WC. In this regard, a new WC model is proposed to simultaneously accommodate these distinct and essential features. In this open-source hardware project, the design, analysis and fabrication of a new active commode WC for indoor applications are performed. Materials and method: A field survey is conducted to identify the requirements of users so as to choose specific features and design constraints for the WC. In this multipurpose self-propelled model, a temporarily detachable circular section is fitted in the seat position to access the water closet bowl. This hinged portion can be released by gravity before reaching above the closet basin. After the toilet usage, the circular lid can be brought back to the initial seating using a lever mechanism and a spring-loaded lock restrains its downward movement. Thereafter, it can be used as an ordinary WC for indoor applications. Moreover, a small wheel with 22 in diameter and removable hand-rests ensured the transferability between utilities. A CAD model is prepared and numerical simulation is performed to verify the structural stability of the design. Results: The optimized model is fabricated using standard manufacturing practices and is delivered to different persons with disabilities to collect user feedback. A systematic skill test is conducted to validate the compliance of the prototype with the user requirements including transferability and independent restroom access. Conclusion: The opinions from most of the users are positive which categorically indicated that the proposed design addresses the multipurpose mobility requirements at indoors.Implications for rehabilitation The expected outcomes and implications of the current commode WC project with regard to rehabilitation purpose are enlisted below: In the present scenario, a WC user is heavily dependent on external assistance to access private spaces in general and toilets in particular. The introduced model is capable to address this shortcoming by enabling the user to access the toilet utility directly by self propelling. Indeed, for a person with locomotor disability, a WC is the natural extension of his physical body. Thereby, this multipurpose commode WC design offers much Independence and greater flexibility to the indoor movements. The proposed design instils confidence to a WC user to access and transfer between facilities by means of self effort. Consequently it is expected to improve the quality of one’s personal life significantly. Importantly, this is an open-source project, those who are interested in rehabilitation motives can modify the present design to suit their local requirements especially in resource-limited settings. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Today engineers designing, building, modifying or migrating control systems for accelerators or large physics experiments have free access to very mature, adaptable, reliable, and high-performance control system toolkits, which have been developed by professional, global collaborations. Interconnectivity between the different control systems is well developed, even industrial vendors provide their devices “control system ready”. With respect to software and networking, an abundance of solutions and applications is already available. But the collaborative power of sharing, effort and success fades as it comes to non-standardized hardware. FPGA-based boards and recent attempts, like the “open hardware initiative”, might move this frontier and open up uncharted waters. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - One of the new targets of wearable robots is not to enhance the lift strength far above human capability by wearing a bulky robot, but to support human capability within its range by wearing lightweight and compact robots. A new approach regarding robotic extra-fingers is presented in this chapter. In particular, different design guidelines to realize robotic extra-fingers for human grasping enhancement are proposed. Such guidelines were followed for the realization of three prototypes obtained using rapid prototyping techniques, i.e., a 3D printer and an open hardware development platform. Both fully actuated and underactuated solutions have been explored. © 2020, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The paper presents the design of a test bench to perform electrochemical process of anodizing on an aluminum piece. The objective is to analyze the influence of the electrolytic solution, temperature and current in the anodic layer formation. The temperature and current controllers are implemented in an open hardware Arduino technology, which guaranteeing the stability of these variables in the process. A mechanical agitator was also added to maintain the homogeneous solution in the tests. An user interface is designed in LabView, where the variables are monitored in real time and allow the storage of the historical data for later analysis. © 2020, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Open source software (OSS) and hardware (OSH) are two expressions of one broader concept and its related movement. One of the most fundamental questions relating to these phenomena is why developers contribute their private resources to these public goods. While this question has been discussed, theorized, and empirically investigated in the context of OSS, there has been no research so far in the context of OSH. Can we really assume the motivations behind the development of the OSH to be the same as those behind OSS? Based on the self-determination theory (SDT), we provide original insights into the motivations behind contributions to OSH development. We collected data from the most common and active 3D printing communities, which are the main loci of OSH development. We thus have a unique cross-sectional data set with participants from over 30 different countries using all kinds of different OSH platforms. Our analysis reveals several important findings: firstly, the motivations are in some aspects very similar to those in open source software notwithstanding different possibilities, hurdles, and incentives regarding the OSS and OSH. Above all, enjoyment-based intrinsic motivation is a major factor affecting contribution levels. Secondly, among internalized extrinsic motivations, expected private benefits through improving own skills stands out. Thirdly, different factors of internalized extrinsic motivations can have different moderating effects on the effect of enjoyment-based intrinsic motivation. Given the imminent changes in business models throughout manufacturing industries in order to adapt to the challenge that OSH will increasingly pose, our findings have important implications not only for OSH communities and 3D development platforms, but also for businesses that want and probably soon have to engage in open innovation. © 2018 The Authors R&D Management published by RADMA and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - The term 'metabolism' identifies the set of chemical processes that occur within a living organism in order to maintain its life. By analogy, we use the 'urban metabolism' concept showing the life of a city. A city is a set of very complex processes involving both public and private stakeholders, areas and infrastructures. Urban metabolism can be analysed and therefore its status evaluated based on measuring specific parameters in order to offer sustainable services for people. The internet of things (IoT) paradigm helps the collection of large amounts of data that become available for decision makers and city managers to improve the urban metabolism. Based on these consideration, in this paper we present and discuss the Arancino.ccTM architecture, in order to achieve 'green' benefits: a better quality of life, a more efficient city management also optimising energy consumptions and costs. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - This work describes the experience of developing a prototype data acquisition system (DAS) to be used in information gathering during the performance of certain vehicle tests. For the recognition of said system, the following acronyms SAPEV were proposed, they come from the Autonomous System for Vehicle Evaluation. Much of this research team already had the experience of having participated in the development of two data acquisition and control systems (SADyC) for general uses, along with some reconfigurations for specific uses. In this framework, to assemble the SAPEV, a data acquisition and control board already developed by this team was adapted: it was a system based on the Arduino Due platform, the environment chosen to provide an open hardware solution to ensure the use free of any user, for which the use of free software was also defined; Thus, a system is available to be used by a large number of users, leaving the possibility for these users to propose and develop extensions to the initial design. A 32-bit microcontroller was used, which provides significant processing power and the possibility of working with the adequate number of analog and digital input and output channels. The interest in the subject arose from the need raised by the Association of Automotive Technicians and Engineers (AITA) and the Network of Laboratories for the Automotive Industry (RELIAU), regarding having a system that allows them to overcome the obstacles generated by current systems in widespread use worldwide: tightness (closed systems), the need for highly trained personnel in its use and, mainly, the high costs for its acquisition, a highly influential problem for small testing laboratories. For this reason, initially, it was studied what the main tests that the laboratories specialized in this type of tests wanted to perform consisted of, and after analyzing them, it was determined that a sufficient response could be provided, based on the open system based on the SADyC of 32 bits. It was only necessary to condition some inputs that had been deprecated in the original system, later it was necessary to carry out the necessary reconfigurations of the system firmware; and, finally, a totally new software was made, in Python language, adapted to the needs. © 2020 Latin American and Caribbean Consortium of Engineering Institutions.

AB  - This paper presents the fusion of project-based learning (PBL) and collaborative learning (CL) cohesively, coordinated with sensors and Bluetooth advancements, open-source programming, and open-source equipment devices, in a specific microcontroller and installed frameworks designing apply autonomy course for the elementary learners. The major purpose of this study is to evaluate the significance of integrating PBL and CL. The course creates capacities and abilities in critical thinking, problem-solving, independent learning, collaboration, and specialized technical information. Since PBL alone does not guarantee profoundly talented cooperation, it was supplemented with CL. This structure coordinated course substance and understudy pragmatic accomplishment in a reenacted learning environment. The understudies built a line following and Bluetooth-controlled robots by actualizing control programming on the “Arduino” open-source platform, just as utilizing remote interchanges as Arduino offers an instinctive advancement condition and different equipment and programming resources that permit quick improvement of microcontroller-based ventures. The basic findings of this study work reveal that teaching, learning, and student assessment processes can be improved by using PBL when integrated with CL. The research successfully extends onto another group of learners for preparing similar gadgets under different timelines. In addition, this paper also discusses upon the problem identification, selection of the equipment, circuit design, hardware mounting, and critical analysis of the results acquired from the course through the personal learning experience of the teachers as well as in the form of feedback from the two groups of young learners. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - This article argues for the exploration of and experimentation with the potentials of civic technoscience as a way of materializing counterdominant practices in human-rights activism that may challenge conventional uses of technology and rooted understandings of expertise. It examines the Ground Truth project, which addresses the Palestinian-Bedouin struggle for indigenous rights in the Naqab desert, in the southern region of Israel/Palestine. It focuses on the use of do-it-yourself (DIY) aerial photography with balloons and kites, alongside other collaborative practices, for mapping and visualizing Bedouin political and spatial claims. Against a backdrop of increasingly technologically savvy legal-professional cultures in human-rights organizations, this article proposes that a community-based DIY approach to truth making may challenge entrenched thresholds of participation and open opportunities for creating hybrid forums in the human-rights field. Finally, it suggests that civic technoscience can offer an experimental ground for training oneself in critical ways of thinking and engaging with technology.

AB  - Farmers need smart tools to optimize their crops and production. They need other agricultural experts such as advisors, accounting companies and also systems and software tools for decision support. The proposed solution is a fuzzy decision support Environment for smart farming (Decifarm) intended to ensure better data structuration extracted from farms, automated calculations, reducing the risk of missing operations, while ensuring data security. We designed a modular architecture to carry out these problems: we first provide crops phenological stages from both historical and forecast weather open data as well as historical data from sensors previously implemented, located at the parcels, with large amounts of data stored into a No-SQL document database; second, we provide control of an automatic water system based on fuzzy logic; finally, a prototype of hardware and software environments was designed from open hardware components, open source languages and open data, promoting both interoperability and extensibility.

AB  - Multi-/Many-core architectures are emerging as scalable, high-performance and energy-efficient computing platforms suitable for a variety of application domains from edge to cloud computing. Recently, the appearance of RISC-V open-source ISA creates new possibilities to develop customized computing platforms with high savings in the non-recurring engineering costs. Moreover, the current trends toward open-source hardware frameworks are aimed to reduce design time and cost for complex system-on-chip architectures. Therefore, modularity and re-usability of hardware components are major challenges for flexible hardware architectures. The motivation behind this work is to introduce a modular cluster-based many-core architecture for FPGA accelerators that is re-usable and flexible tailored to implement different many-core taxonomies with less design time and costs by using regular and replicated sets of computing, memory, and interconnection blocks. The proposed many-core architecture is built using multiple processing clusters coupled with a NoC for communication which allows a high degree of design scalability. The processing cluster inside features a configurable multi-core architecture consisting of multiple RISC-V processing elements (PE) tightly coupled with a bus-based interconnection for intra-cluster communication using parameterized scratchpad shared memory. Each PE features a single RISC-V core with a tightly coupled parameterized scratchpad local memory and generic AXI interface. Evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed architecture features a scalable computing performance of 501 MOp/s for 4 clusters and 878 MOp/s for 8 clusters. Moreover, a scalable memory bandwidth up to 4.3 GB/s is achieved for 9 clusters with a power consumption of 1.4 W per cluster utilizing 7.7% of on-chip memory resources. The many-core architecture is implemented and evaluated on Xilinx Virtex Ultrascale+ with the feature of changing the architecture configurations during run-time using dynamic and partial reconfiguration which provides more flexibility and re-usability. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The laboratory is a research powerhouse being a transportation membrane to propagate new and proven knowledge. This paper aims to descriptively disseminate the concept of horizontal integration with emphasize on Internet of Things (IoT) from research in tropical functional food resources to teaching excellence framework. The five-stage framework includes (1) vision internalization, (2) persistence propagation, (3) new technology adaptation, (4) extending collaboration, and (5) outcome integration. The vision internalization stage produces a better understanding of the big picture and systematic approach. The experience is then brought to Research Methodology and Research Design classes. Persistence propagation may be better translated to relentlessly solving the problem and to increase the laboratory power, including providing fail-safe and verification procedures of possibly dubious results produced in the laboratory. The research may improve operating procedures or methods in a laboratory manual. The movement of open hardware dan IoTmakes it possible for faster technology adaptation to food-laboratory. IoT is integrated into the closest courses. When an integration requires expansion and collaboration, students are prepared to conduct functional food research in partner laboratories. The outcome integration fully materialized when enough new and related knowledge are accumulated. Researchers may visit and align the current curriculum in the subject of Functional Food Technology. In summary, the horizontal integration with emphasize on IoT results in a unique set of research-teaching excellence framework that is incrementally developed. © International Association of Online Engineering.

AB  - Mechanical ventilation is commonly used for environmental thermal regulation inside closed-field agricultural production systems. Analyzing the air distribution inside these facilities and the correct operation of the fans can be a challenging. This could be determined using cost prohibitive techniques as particle image velocimetry or deploying large wind sensors networks on-site. To avoid this limitation without a lack of measurement accuracy, this research was focused on developing and test a low-cost anemometer network based in low cost propeller’s anemometers, built using fused 3D-printed and open-hardware platforms. Four propeller anemometers with three to six blades were simulated using the 6-DOF method of ANSYS computer fluid dynamics software. Similar results were obtained for all the simulated models with minor differences. Anemometers were tested in an open circuit wind tunnel before to be evaluated in two open compost dairy barn building using high-volume low-speed and low-volume high-speed fans. Data were analyzed by employing contour maps, descriptive statistics and correlation. The results show that the anemometer network determines the fan’s wind profile for wind speeds over 0.7 m s-1 and it was possible to determine the facilities spots with ventilation problems. The proposed anemometer network and methodology are a good alternative to analyze the operating conditions of the tested agricultural facilities and optimize its performance. © 2020, Eesti Pollumajandusulikool.

AB  - Building novel analytical systems requires various elements: Sensors, a sampling system and data evaluation software. For emerging technologies, such as ambient ionization mass spectrometry (AIMS), the assembly of a functional prototype is often more time-consuming than developing the actual probes. The modification of commercial platforms for testing hardware is usually not possible due to technical and legal restrictions. Therefore, we designed a robotic platform, which is based on RepRap 3D-printer components, and therefore easy to adopt for custom set-ups. Adjustable rails in an aluminium frame construction facilitate the mounting of additional parts such as sensors, probes, or optical components. The Open LabBot uses industry-standard G-code for its control. Its simple syntax facilitates the programming of the movement. We developed two programs for the robot control and mass spectrometry imaging: “LABI-Imaging” for synchronizing the robot movements and MS data acquisition and “RmsiGUI”, a software solution for the complete AIMS workflow. We proved the functionality of the system by the automated sampling and classification of essential oils with a PlasmaChip probe. Further, we performed an AIMSI imaging experiment of a lime slice with laser desorption low-temperature plasma (LD-LTP) ionization, demonstrating the integration of the complete workflow in RmsiGUI. The design of the Open LabBot and the software are released under open licenses to promote their use and adoption in the instrument developers’ community. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - IoT (Internet of Things) refers to an integration concept of different communication systems used for connecting heterogeneous devices with constraints on processing, storage capabilities and power consumption to the Internet, with the purpose of data collecting for analysis and decision making about the measurements of data collected. This new paradigm can be applied in different fields to wirelessly measure variables through mobile devices, laptops and wireless devices having in mind restrictions in terms of battery lifetime, capacity, and cost. This paper describes the implementation of a flexible and low-cost monitoring and data collecting platform using sensors based on open hardware such as Arduino, interconnected through a LoRa network and a cloud-based data storage system developed using open source code. The main objective is to quickly collect different types of variables based on a flexible monitoring and collecting platform adaptable to different types of sensors which could be used in both rural and urban areas in applications that require long-range transmission and low energy consumption. In the future, research on the analysis of performance and improvement solutions will be carried out, as well as the use of other types of devices and protocols in order to compare performance and expand the field of implementation of the proposed platform. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - This research studied the feasibility in applying the flight controller of the unmanned aerial vehicle on a pontoon boat in fish farming industry. A small-scale autonomous pontoon boat has been built, equipped with the open-hardware flight controller, GPS receiver, Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) and the magnetometer. A 23 factorial design based on Design of Experiment (DOE) is carried out to study the influence of three parameters (turn_rate, turn_angle and damping) on the response variable (peak-to-peak deviation from the desired trajectory). Total 24 experiments have been conducted by setting the desired trajectory as a circle with diameter 20 m. The peakto-peak deviation in each experiment has been observed. The analyses revealed that the damping has low interaction with the turn angle and turn rate while there is a stronger interaction between the turn angle and turn rate. And the peak-to-peak deviation of the trajectory tends to decrease when the parameter damping was set to high value. The regression model has been derived and plotted as a response surface. The optimized parameters were selected from the plot and perform the experiment with three replications. The results confirm that parameters tuning has improved the performance of the boat significantly. With the DOE approach, the impact of two or more parameters on a response, the interaction between parameters can be investigated systematically. This approach is an effective way to tuning the parameters and can be applied to various kinds of the autonomous vehicle. © 2020, Chulalongkorn University, Faculty of Fine and Applied Arts.

AB  - Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) threatens to overwhelm our medical infrastructure at the regional level causing spikes in mortality rates because of shortages of critical equipment, like ventilators. Fortunately, with the recent development and widespread deployment of small-scale manufacturing technologies like RepRap-class 3-D printers and open source microcontrollers, mass distributed manufacturing of ventilators has the potential to overcome medical supply shortages. In this study, after providing a background on ventilators, the academic literature is reviewed to find the existing and already openly-published, vetted designs for ventilators systems. These articles are analyzed to determine if the designs are open source both in spirit (license) as well as practical details (e.g. possessing accessible design source files, bill of materials, assembly instructions, wiring diagrams, firmware and software as well as operation and calibration instructions). Next, the existing Internet and gray literature are reviewed for open source ventilator projects and designs. The results of this review found that the tested and peer-reviewed systems lacked complete documentation and the open systems that were documented were either at the very early stages of design (sometimes without even a prototype) and were essentially only basically tested (if at all). With the considerably larger motivation of an ongoing pandemic, it is assumed these projects will garner greater attention and resources to make significant progress to reach a functional and easily-replicated system. There is a large amount of future work needed to move open source ventilators up to the level considered scientific-grade equipment, and even further work needed to reach medical-grade hardware. Future work is needed to achieve the potential of this approach by developing policies, updating regulations, and securing funding mechanisms for the development and testing of open source ventilators for both the current COVID19 pandemic as well as for future pandemics and for everyday use in low-resource settings. © 2020 Pearce JM.

AB  - The work presented in this paper takes place in the design initiatives that have emerged to thwart BadUSB threats [59]. Though many attempts were focusing on the host side, by enhancing the operating system’s USB sub-module robustness [78, 80] or by adding a proxy between the host and the device [6, 53], we have chosen to focus our efforts on the device side. More specifically, our work presents the WooKey platform, a custom highly secure USB thumb drive with mass storage capabilities, designed for user data encryption and protection, and embedding a full-fledged set of in-depth defenses. The device encloses a firmware with a secure DFU (Device Firmware Update) implementation using up-to-date cryptography as well as an external and extractable authentication token based on a secure element. The runtime software security is built upon EwoK, an innovative open source microkernel designed for microcontrollers with advanced security and performance in mind. Finally, another strength of the project is its core guiding principle: provide an open source and open hardware platform [3] using off-the-shelf components. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Open source hardware for scientific equipment needs to provide source files and enough documentation to allow the study, replication and modification of the design. In addition, parametric modeling is encouraged in order to facilitate customization for other experiments. Parametric design using a solid modeling programming language allows customization and provides a source file for the design. OpenSCAD is the most widely used scripting tool for parametric modeling of open source labware. However, OpenSCAD lacks the ability to export to standard parametric formats; thus, the parametric dimensional information of the model is lost. This is an important deficiency because it is key to share the design in the most accessible formats with no information loss. In this work we analyze OpenSCAD and compare it with FreeCAD Python scripts. We have created a parametric open source hardware design to compare these tools. Our findings show that although Python for FreeCAD is more arduous to learn, its advantages counterbalance the initial difficulties. The main benefits are being able to export to standard parametric models; using Python language with its libraries; and the ability to use and integrate the models in its graphical interface. Thus, making it more appropriate to design open source hardware for scientific equipment. © 2019 Machado et al.

AB  - In this article we present a new low-cost physiological signal acquisition platform in compliance with Open-Source Hardware philosophy. The device contains an electrocardiography circuit; two electrodermal activity channels that implement a time-multiplexing technique to remove inter-channel coupling interference; and a skin temperature module. These features make the platform suitable for experiments involving Affective Computing. We have assessed the performance of this device in terms of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Background Noise Level (BNL), an adapted MPEG7 feature for electrocardiography signals. This platform outperforms other commercial devices and most similar state-of-art studies on SNR. Results show values of 11.96, 30.01, 68.40 dB for ECG, EDA and ST, respectively, for SNR, and -28.31 dB for BNL in ECG. Both features were obtained by sampling physiological signals at a frequency of 256 Hz. © 2001-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Industry is building larger, more complex, manycore processors on the back of strong institutional knowledge, but academic projects face difficulties in replicating that scale. To alleviate these difficulties and to develop and share knowledge, the community needs open architecture frameworks for simulation, chip design, and software exploration that support extensibility, scalability, and configurability, alongside an established base of verification tools and supported software. In this article, we present OpenPiton, an open source framework for building scalable architecture research prototypes from one core to 500 million cores. OpenPiton is the world's first open source, general-purpose, multithreaded manycore processor, and framework. OpenPiton is highly configurable, providing a rich design space spanning a variety of hardware parameters that researchers can change. OpenPiton designs can be emulated on FPGAs, where they can run full-stack multiuser Debian Linux. OpenPiton is designed to scale to very large core fabrics, enabling researchers to measure operating system, compiler, and software scalability. The mature codebase reflects the complexity of an industrial-grade design and provides the necessary scripts to build new chips, making OpenPiton a natural choice for computer-aided design (CAD) research. OpenPiton has been validated with a 25-core chip prototype, named Piton, and is bolstered by a validation suite that has thousands of tests, providing an environment to test new hardware designs while verifying the correctness of the whole system. OpenPiton is being actively used in research both internally to Princeton and in the wider community, as well as being adopted in education, industry, and government settings. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Fiber photometry is the process of recording bulk neural activity by measuring fluorescence changes in activity sensitive indicators such as GCaMP through an optical fiber. We present a system of open source hardware and software for fiber photometry data acquisition consisting of a compact, low cost, data acquisition board built around the Micropython microcontroller, and a cross platform graphical user interface (GUI) for controlling acquisition and visualising signals. The system can acquire two analog and two digital signals, and control two external LEDs via built in LED drivers. Time-division multiplexed illumination allows independent readout of fluorescence evoked by different excitation wavelengths from a single photoreceiver signal. Validation experiments indicate this approach offers better signal to noise for a given average excitation light intensity than sinusoidally-modulated illumination. pyPhotometry is substantially cheaper than commercial hardware filling the same role, and we anticipate, as an open source and comparatively simple tool, it will be easily adaptable and therefore of broad interest to a wide range of users. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Azimuthal beam scanning eliminates the uneven excitation field arising from laser interference in through-objective total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. The same principle can be applied to scanning angle interference microscopy (SAIM), where precision control of the scanned laser beam presents unique technical challenges for the builders of custom azimuthal scanning microscopes. Accurate synchronization between the instrument computer, beam scanning system and excitation source is required to collect high quality data and minimize sample damage in SAIM acquisitions. Drawing inspiration from open-source prototyping systems, like the Arduino microcontroller boards, we developed a new instrument control platform to be affordable, easily programmed, and broadly useful, but with integrated, precision analog circuitry and optimized firmware routines tailored to advanced microscopy. We show how the integration of waveform generation, multiplexed analog outputs, and native hardware triggers into a single central hub provides a versatile platform for performing fast circle-scanning acquisitions, including azimuthal scanning SAIM and multiangle TIRF. We also demonstrate how the low communication latency of our hardware platform can reduce image intensity and reconstruction artifacts arising from synchronization errors produced by software control. Our complete platform, including hardware design, firmware, API, and software, is available online for community-based development and collaboration. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Large scale deployment of Smart Grids (SGs) and Smart Micro-Grids (SMGs) requires overcoming problems related to interoperability and high costs. To automate and monitor these challenging infrastructures, industrial equipment is used due to their reliability and versatility. In particular, Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are the prevalent automation units devoted to process control. They are combined with Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, responsible of acquiring and displaying operational data. One of the prominent trends to facilitate such deployment is the open source movement, being the Arduino microcontroller one of the most illustrative examples. This low-cost and community-supported platform is achieving increasing attention from academy and industry. However, there is still a need of integration frameworks to combine this device with reliable industrial equipment. This paper presents an approach that seamlessly integrates PLCs and Arduino platforms into a common SCADA system using the connectivity provided by Open Platform Communications (OPC). The open source device is devoted to sensing tasks. As a proof of concept, an application case has been carried out within the automation system of an experimental SMG, where the temperature of a PV panel is sensed and monitored. The developed system is described and successful results are reported. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The power efficiency of photovoltaic modules is highly correlated with their health status. Under dynamically changing environments, photovoltaic defects could spontaneously form and develop into fatal faults during the daily operation of photovoltaic plants. To facilitate defect detection with less human intervention, a nondestructive and contactless visual inspection system with the help of unmanned aerial vehicles and edge computing is proposed in this work. Limited by the resources of edge devices and the availability of images of photovoltaic defects for training, we developed an online solution combined with deep learning, data argumentation and transfer learning to properly address the issues of running resource hungry applications on edge devices and lack of training samples faced by the deep learning approaches used in the field. With the reduction of the network depth of the deep convolutional neural network model and the transfer of features from the learned defects, the resource consumption of our proposed approach is significantly reduced, and thus can be used on a wide range of edge devices to complete defect detection in a timely manner with high accuracy. To study the performance of our design, a testbed was built from open source hardware and software, and field trials were carried out in three photovoltaic plants. The experimental results clearly demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of our design for detecting visible defects on photovoltaic modules. © 2019 ACM.

AB  - This paper presents an intelligent electronic device (IED) utilized for automatic meter readings (AMR) scheme using “Open-Source” software. This IED is utilized to measure a low-voltage intelligent electronic device) system with a boundless number of sensors, and it is accessible on the Internet of Things (IoT). The utilized equipment for this task is Arduino UNO R3 motherboard and fringe sensors, which are used for measurement of the referenced information. The Arduino motherboard is used not only for sole tranquility of equipment but also for serving as wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) switch for the sensors. The personal computer is utilized to gather information and perform client-side calculations. The server works based on an open-source program written in Java programming language. The underlying objective of the proposed scheme is to make the meter based on the “Do It Yourself” methodology which requires considerably fewer funds. Also, it is conceivable by keeping easy to understand interface, information legitimacy, precision of measured information and convenience for the conclusive client. The information is measured in just about 1 ms which is superb for custom-designed IED. Furthermore, the measured qualities are calculated based on their RMS values to be used for analyzing and further presentation of data. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - There is a growing interest in the open-source hardware movement to amortize non-recurring engineering costs by using plug-and-play system-on-chip (SoC) designs, where the communication among different components is provided by an on-chip interconnection network. Unfortunately, building an on-chip network (OCN) that is suitable for a specific SoC design requires the exploration of a large number of design options and involves diverse research methodologies to evaluate performance, area, energy, and timing. In this paper, we propose PyOCN, a unified framework that vertically integrates multiple research methodologies to enable productively exploring the OCN design space. PyOCN is the first comprehensive framework for modeling (e.g., functional-level, cycle-level, and register-transfer-level), testing (e.g., unit testing, integration testing, and property-based random testing), and evaluating (e.g., simulating, generating, and characterizing) on-chip interconnection networks. We use a case study based on a 64-terminal butterfly network to illustrate the key features of PyOCN and to demonstrate the framework's potential in productively modeling, testing, and evaluating OCNs. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - We present RoFICoM, a new retractable connection device that allows for mechanical, electric, and data communication connection between separable robotic modules. The device is intentionally designed to be used in lattice-type metamorphic robots, however, its applicability is much wider. The main novelty of our solution lies primarily in a new unique flat design and spatial compactness of the connector. With a flat connector, much more space is left for the body of a robotic module in the structure. Moreover, the connector is also fully self-contained device with well defined mechanical, electrical and data interfaces, hence it can be easily embedded in various robotic solutions. Our RoFICoM connector is easy to produce, it is open-hardware and free for non-commercial use. In the paper, we give construction details and report on a couple of experiments we performed to demonstrate key features of the connection achieved with two RoFICoM devices. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Light-sheet microscopy is an ideal technique for imaging large cleared samples; however, the community is still lacking instruments capable of producing volumetric images of centimeter-sized cleared samples with near-isotropic resolution within minutes. Here, we introduce the mesoscale selective plane-illumination microscopy initiative, an open-hardware project for building and operating a light-sheet microscope that addresses these challenges and is compatible with any type of cleared or expanded sample (www.mesospim.org). © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.

AB  - Fuzzy rule-based systems (FRBSs) have been successfully applied to a wide range of real-world problems. However, they suffer from some design issues related to the difficulty to implement them on different hardware platforms without additional efforts. To bridge this gap, recently, the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society has sponsored the publication of the standard IEEE Std 1855-2016 which is aimed at providing the fuzzy community with a well-defined approach to model FRBSs in a hardware-independent way. In order to provide a runnable version of an FRBS that is designed in accordance with the IEEE Std 1855-2016, the open source library Java Fuzzy Markup Language (JFML) has been developed. However, due to hardware and/or software limitations of embedded systems, it is not always possible to run an IEEE Std 1855-2016 FRBS on this kind of systems. The aim of this paper is to overcome this drawback by developing a new JFML module that assists developers in the design and implementation of FRBSs for open hardware–embedded systems. In detail, the module supports several connection types (WiFi, Bluetooth, and USB) in order to make feasible running FRBSs in a remote computer when, due to hardware limitations, it is not possible that they run locally in the embedded systems. The new JFML module is ready for Arduino™ and Raspberry Pi, but it can be easily extended to other hardware architectures. Moreover, the new JFML module allows to automatically generate runnable files on Arduino™ or Raspberry Pi in order to support nonexpert users, that is, users without specific knowledge about embedded systems or without strong programming skills. The use of the new JFML module is illustrated in two case studies. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Atlantis Press SARL.

AB  - Nowadays, industrial automation systems are mostly used with proprietary hardware and software. Creating such systems requires relatively large costs. This is a problem when designing control systems with a limited budget, which are created, for example, in developing countries or small businesses. Currently, there have been opportunities to create low-cost automation systems by using solutions distributed on the basis of open-source and open-hardware. The work reviews the most important solutions and presents examples of their use in automation systems. © '2019. IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A wide range of medical devices have significant electronic components. Compared to open-source medical software, open (and open-source) electronic hardware has been less published in peer-reviewed literature. In this review, we explore the developments, significance, and advantages of using open platform electronic hardware for medical devices. Open hardware electronics platforms offer not just shorter development times, reduced costs, and customization; they also offer a key potential advantage which current commercial medical devices lack—seamless data sharing for machine learning and artificial intelligence. We explore how various electronic platforms such as microcontrollers, single board computers, field programmable gate arrays, development boards, and integrated circuits have been used by researchers to design medical devices. Researchers interested in designing low cost, customizable, and innovative medical devices can find references to various easily available electronic components as well as design methodologies to integrate those components for a successful design. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - As is commonly known, hardware in a computer system requires a processor to run the operating system. The primary architectures that form the basis of most processors are CISC and RISC. CISC includes long sub-level commands for effective memory management and simple compiler implementations to be developed. Thus CISC has a complex set of commands; hence the name Complex Instruction Set Computer. On the other hand, CISC has had backward compatibility since the 1970s. Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC), the other popular architecture, simplifies command sets and handles access to memory with load-store commands. Since the instruction set is simplified, the hardware runs faster. In addition, RISC-based processors contain less chip-sets and may be designed faster. Currently, with the prevalence of the Internet of Things (IoT), the demand for RISC architectures has increased and its usage in embedded devices has become widespread. The ARM processor is a successful example of the RISC architecture adaptation. However, ARM processor production has certain license term limitations and contains a few design flaws in its architecture [1]. In 2010, the RISC-V processor architecture, which was developed as an open source instruction set at Berkeley University, paves the way for open source hardware in terms of its BSD license and design professionalism. As a result, it will be possible to produce their own processors for communities and organizations without license restrictions. In this paper, we discuss the building blocks of the development life-cycle of an open source operating system on the RISC-V architecture. As an operating system base, we implement MILIS Linux, an open source operating system development project. It has an independent user space and its own package manager. For a completely independent open source computing system, open source RISC-V hardware architecture provides the freedom that is needed. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Growth in open-source hardware designs combined with the low-cost of high performance optoelectronic and robotics components has supported a resurgence of in-house custom lab equipment development. We describe a low cost (below $700), open-source, fully customizable high-throughput imaging system for analytical microbiology applications. The system comprises a Raspberry Pi camera mounted on an aluminium extrusion frame with 3D-printed joints controlled by an Arduino microcontroller running open-source Repetier Host Firmware. The camera position is controlled by simple G-code scripts supplied from a Raspberry Pi singleboard computer and allow customized time-lapse imaging of microdevices over a large imaging area. Open-source OctoPrint software allows remote access and control. This simple yet effective design allows high-throughput microbiology testing in multiple formats including formats for bacterial motility, colony growth, microtitre plates and microfluidic devices termed ‘lab-on-a-comb’ to screen the effects of different culture media components and antibiotics on bacterial growth. The open-source robot design allows customization of the size of the imaging area; the current design has an imaging area of ~420 × 300mm, which allows 29 ‘lab-on-a-comb’ devices to be imaged which is equivalent 3480 individual 1μl samples. The system can also be modified for fluorescence detection using LED and emission filters embedded on the PiCam for more sensitive detection of bacterial growth using fluorescent dyes. © 2019 Needs et al.

AB  - This paper describes the design, manufacture, and performance of a highly dexterous, low-profile, 7 Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) robotic arm for CT-guided percutaneous needle biopsy. Direct CT guidance allows physicians to localize tumours quickly; however, needle insertion is still performed by hand. This system is mounted to a fully active motion stage superior to the patient's head and teleoperated by a radiologist. Unlike other similar robots, this robot's fully serial-link approach uses a unique combination of belt and cable drives for high-transparency and minimal-backlash, allowing for an expansive working area and numerous approach angles to targets, all while maintaining a small in-bore cross-section of less than 16cm2. Simulations verified the system's expansive collision free work-space and ability to hit targets across the entire chest, as required for lung cancer biopsy. Targeting error was on average &lt; 1mm on a teleoperated accuracy task, illustrating the system's sufficient accuracy to perform biopsy procedures. While this system was developed for lung biopsies, it can be easily modified for other CT-guided needle based procedures. Additionally, this system is open-hardware.1. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - This work studied different digital embedded platforms which can be programmed using Arduino IDE software and which can be used for digital control and data acquisition applications. Specifically three kind of Arduino Board (Arduino UNO, Arduino Mega y Arduino Due) and two ESP based board (ESP8622 and ESP32) are evaluated and compared. The comparison is based on the execution time of mathematical operations and a function required for data acquisition or digital control and includes (i) digital ports writing, (ii) analog signal acquisition, (iii) execution of mathematic operation in integer and float format, and (iv) the execution of the data processing code. The execution time is measured by using a methodology which is simple to implement for any other digital device. Because of each platform uses its own Arduino DUE library to generate the assembly code for its own microcontroller, the instructions adopted for both generating the actions to measure and generating the testing signals are written using Arduino IDE commands and using instructions that any entry-level user may adopt. In conclusion, from the experimental results it is observed the high difference in the execution time of the different platforms, especially between ESPx boards and Arduino boards. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - The control and monitoring of physical variables in real time is very important to the industry to guarantee the quality of products, industrial safety, the operation of the machines and the manufacturing process. Nowadays, the Salvadoran industry must adopt technologies associated with the Internet of Things. Understanding as Internet of Things the possibility to provide Internet connection to any object, giving the user the possibility to make physical measures or remote controlling. In this case, knowing that the impact that represent for industry the control and monitoring of physical variables is very important, ITCA FEPADE Regional Center of Santa Ana City has designed and implemented a IoT platform to monitor the physical variables with educational purposes. For the designing of the platform some open source tools were use. The hardware tools used were atmega 328p and xbee antennas. PHP, Java and C were the programming language used for the interface design. This IoT platform can control the electric charges and monitoring variables like: Electric current and power, electrical energy and temperature. For statistical measurement the computer center 2 and classroom 103 were chosen. For using this software, the user just needs a smartphone, a computer or a tablet to connect to the IoT platform. The user can visualize and have control of physical variables using the platform interface. Both devices (user device and the server) must be connected to the same network, in this case ITCA Santa Ana's network. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Keeping an algal culture at a constant turbidity requires expensive and complex devices. We designed a low-cost, user friendly but also highly configurable phototurbidostat using 3D-printing, open-source software and electronics. The device is able to monitor in real time a culture in photobioreactor, and dynamically adjust the conditions to maintain the turbidity at a desired value. It can accommodate to a large set of volumes or laboratory equipments with little effort thanks to its modular and scalable design. Each module (such as light, pumps or sensors) are autonomous and controllable via Wi-Fi. Furthermore, our phototurbidostat is fully open-source and can be remotely controlled by a smartphone or a computer via a web-based graphical user interface. Finally, the device can be reproduced easily for a cost ranging between 1/20th and 1/50th of the price of a classical commercial device. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - The promise of widespread 5th generation (5G) and beyond wireless systems can only be fulfilled through extensive experimental campaigns aimed at validating the large body of theoretical findings on millimeter wave (mmWave) and Terahertz (THz) frequencies. However, experimental research efforts in this field are often stymied by the lack of open hardware, open-source software, and affordable testbeds accessible by the research community at large, who is now forced to perform simulation-based research or – if at all possible – small-scale, ad hoc experiments. After discussing existing research challenges in mmWave and THz testbeds, in this paper we propose MillimeTera, a vision for a new generation of disruptive experimental platforms that will radically transform the status quo in mmWave and THz research. We next discuss our preliminary hardware and software efforts, and finally provide a roadmap of our main design and development goals in the years to come. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Physiological sensors can be used to detect changes in the emotional state of users with affective computing. This has lately been applied in the educational domain, aimed to better support learners during the learning process. For this purpose, we have developed the AICARP (Ambient Intelligence Context-aware Affective Recommender Platform) infrastructure, which detects changes in the emotional state of the user and provides personalized multisensorial support to help manage the emotional state by taking advantage of ambient intelligence features. We have developed a third version of this infrastructure, AICARP.V3, which addresses several problems detected in the data acquisition stage of the second version, (i.e., intrusion of the pulse sensor, poor resolution and low signal to noise ratio in the galvanic skin response sensor and slow response time of the temperature sensor) and extends the capabilities to integrate new actuators. This improved incorporates a new acquisition platform (shield) called PhyAS (Physiological Acquisition Shield), which reduces the number of control units to only one, and supports both gathering physiological signals with better precision and delivering multisensory feedback with more flexibility, by means of new actuators that can be added/discarded on top of just that single shield. The improvements in the quality of the acquired signals allow better recognition of the emotional states. Thereof, AICARP.V3 gives a more accurate personalized emotional support to the user, based on a rule‐based approach that triggers multisensorial feedback, if necessary. This represents progress in solving an open problem: develop systems that perform as effectively as a human expert in a complex task such as the recognition of emotional states. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The retention model by Rao and Buri is often used to characterize microparticles and other drug delivery systems for their bio-adhesive properties. Currently, these experiments are performed on customized setups, reducing reproducibility of results obtained in different labs. As a solution, we propose a fully replicable retention model, which can be constructed by parts mostly made by 3D printing and laser cutting as well as a limited amount of other easy to source and commercially available parts. In addition of being fully replicable, the setup features integration of a climate-controlled chamber, a peristaltic pump and an autosampler, thereby enabling fully automated but customized control of the experiments. Using the presented retention model setup and an automated experimental sequence, the setup has been proven capable of investigating mucoadhesion of differently shaped particles to porcine intestinal tissue. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Syringe pumps are widely used in a multitude of tasks where precise volumes of an extrudate need to be delivered at a specific flow rate. In the past decade various open source syringe pump designs have accelerated scientific research and exploration by reducing costs and introducing new ideas. To further expand the capabilities of open source syringe pumps we introduce a novel syringe pump design, the Ystruder. It features a load cell to monitor the piston force. This capability enables clog detection as well as development of advanced dosing algorithms. The Ystruder can be monitored wirelessly through a browser-based interface that is integrated into the embedded system. The design is modular and simple which facilitates different syringe and motor configurations, to meet a wide range of use cases. Finally, the Ystruder is not limited to functioning solely as a pump as it can be integrated into a wide range of devices such as three-dimensional motion systems. Here the dosing accuracy and repeatability of the Ystruder are quantified, and we demonstrate its functionality both as a syringe pump and a paste extruder for 3D printing. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Due to the rapid increase in the elderly population and single-person households, it is absolutely necessary to observe the indoor activities of marginalized people, such as the elderly or the disabled, to detect abnormal conditions. At this time, contact sensors are have limited applicability due to their continuous wear, so there is a need to develop technology to collect daily life activities of the elderly. In this study, we tried to track the elderly living alone using images obtained from an open source camera. The system captures images by linking a low-cost camera module to open source hardware, and an algorithm is implemented to detect falls. This system can be used to reduce the cost of social care by improving the cost of care in the aging population, and this will contribute to promoting and developing management prescription guidelines through risk detection. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This paper presents a new multi-agent framework using open-source software (MAFOSS). The proposed framework is a modular and cost-effective open-source hardware and software platform that is intended to help develop multiagent systems for research and education. Numerous multi-agent platforms have been developed in the literature to date that are used in various robotic applications, such as surveillance, target localization, cooperative estimation, among others. However, most of them are either tailored towards particular applications or driven by expensive software and hardware. The proposed MAFOSS system is developed for robotic applications, where a team of mobile agents (robots) is deployed to achieve a common goal. A major contribution of the MAFOSS system is the development of an open-hardware platform for differential-drive mobile robots (herein called 'eduMOD' mobile robots). The software architecture of the current framework mostly relies on the robot operating system (ROS). Regardless of internal hardware and/or software architecture, appropriate actions can be applied to actuators of an individual or a team of mobile agents for controlling their motions. A few case studies have been conducted to evaluate the performance of MAFOSS. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Electromyography (sEMG) is the technique applied to measure the bio-potential signal produced by a contracting skeletal muscle. sEMG has been used for subject intention estimation, force estimation, limb angle estimation and determining muscle activation timing. Typically most sEMG devices on the market, and in literature, are not open source hardware. This results in a device that can be considered as a black box, as it is difficult to determine the applied signal processing. This paper presents an open source low-cost active sEMG circuit, allowing an understanding of sEMG and the challenges involved in designing a high quality device. An open source sEMG design reduces the time and cost associated with initial sEMG research, providing a larger number of researchers with the opportunity to utilise sEMG. The device has been tested on three subjects, resulting in a low baseline noise ⩽5.2μVrms and great line noise rejection, resulting in a sensitive device that can capture high quality bio-potential signals. © 2019 The Author(s)

AB  - To achieve the application of BeagleBone Black in real-time control system, a real-time operating system needs to run on it instead of Linux, a time-sharing operating system. This paper proposes apply the embedded real-time operating system TI-RTOS on BeagleBone Black, and details the flow of construction debugging environment, emulator debug environment and serial debug environment on Code Composer Studio, and how to use semaphores in the user app. The advantage of this solution is that it combines the real-time system and open source software platform features of TI-RTOS with open source hardware and low-cost features of BeagleBone Black. By the test of running a typical routine of TI-RTOS on the BeagleBone Black in the debugging environment, it shows that the construction of debugging environment for TI-RTOS running on BeagleBone Black is valid. By referring to this paper, developers can save preparation time in the research to develop real-time intelligent system of TI-RTOS on BeagleBone Black. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - The price of renewable energy is dropping rapidly. Energy storage will be needed to take full advantage of abundant but intermittent energy sources. Even with economies of scale, the price is prohibitively high for a lithium-ion battery pack capable of storing tens of kilowatts of energy for many consumers. A more abundant and less expensive material is necessary. All-iron chemistry presents a transformative opportunity for stationary energy storage: it is simple, cheap, abundant, and safe. All-iron batteries can store energy by reducing iron (II) to metallic iron at the anode and oxidizing iron (II) to iron (III) at the cathode. The total cell is highly stable, efficient, non-toxic, and safe. The total cost of materials is $0.1 per watt-hour of capacity at wholesale prices. This battery may be a useful component of open source hardware projects that require a safe and ecologically friendly battery. This is also one of the few battery chemistries that can be built safely in a DIY setting. © 2019

AB  - Humanitarian response often addresses the basic human needs which include safe, sanitary, hazard free environment. From the war torn countries to remote communities, untreated household waste water creates living conditions directly affecting human welfare. We present an IoT enabled, semi-industrial, mobile waste water treatment solution targeted for communities in remote sub-Arctic regions without a centralized sewer system or a waste water treatment facility. The open-source hardware and software platforms were implemented on an Arduino Mega and Raspberry Pi to operate a household water reuse system. The water reuse system was developed as part of the Alaska Water and Sewer Challenge to address a cost effective alternative to piped water and sewer service in unserved remote Alaskan Communities. The semi-industrial water treatment system was controlled using the internet enabled Arduino Mega and Raspberry Pi components-off-the-shelf (COTS) that allowed for both on-site and remote control. While implemented as a proof-of-concept of a treatment system to evaluate existing waste water technology, the production model can take full advantage of the internet of things concepts that would allow for proactive maintenance scheduling, optimized treatment time to meet available community electrical loads, and remote troubleshooting and operation to name a few. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Reliable, accurate, and affordable linear motion control systems for precision agriculture applications are currently not easily accessible due to their elevated cost. Most systems available to the public have price tags in the thousands of dollars and their dimensions cannot be easily customized. Current systems have a maximum length of about ten meters, and for a typical greenhouse application that length may not be sufficient. The price of the system increases with an increase in length, and with a base price in the thousands of dollars it becomes impractical to buy a system for such application. Our HyperRail is a modular linear motion system with a repeatability of 2 mm and current top speed of 200 mm/s. This is possible through a stepper motor driver that allows for 1/16th microstepping giving an average of 6180 steps per revolution. An advantage that this system has is its ability to increase or decrease the length of system with minimum effort and only nominal increase in price. The HyperRail can be mounted on a set of tripods or directly on the structure of a building such as a greenhouse. The base price for a three-meter system, on tripods is US$278 and only US$45 for each additional 1.5 m of length. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - This paper presents an open-source and low-cost characterization device designed to investigate the behavior of active textiles, which are textiles having the ability to actuate (produce motion/force) and or act as a sensor. Although specifically designed for active textiles, the characterization device is broadly applicable for studying the performance of actuators including but not limited to Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) wires, SMA springs, and electroactive polymers. The characterization device may be operated in several modes that enable a wide variety of experimental protocols to be automated. These modes include but are not limited to automatic displacement and displacement rate mode, automatic force mode, and manual displacement mode. For active textiles that actuate by electrical stimulus or by resistive heating, the electronic system has five independent motor drivers. For each driver, the voltage drop across its outputs and current are measured, enabling the measurement of textile power consumption and other electrical properties. The validation of the Active Textile Characterization Device uses a contractile SMA knitted textile actuated by four motor drivers through resistive heating. Several protocols were successfully conducted to demonstrate the experimental flexibility of the system. During these experiments, knit length, knit tension, current through the knit, voltage drop across the knit, and room temperature were measured with respect to time. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - We propose a new, fully open-source, low-cost, and small-sized Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) for measuring near-surface water quality in real time in various environments. Existing commercial USVs are expensive and not fully based on open-source hardware, making it difficult to purchase them and to modify their designs and programming to suit various environments. In contrast, the USV platform proposed in this paper is completely open-source, from hardware to software; most parts of the platform can be 3D-printed, and it can be easily modified and upgraded in terms of both design and programming. The platform is equipped with off-the-shelf water sensors for acquiring data like as pH, turbidity, and temperature to measure water quality in real water resources (such as ponds, reservoirs, and lakes). Furthermore, we provide an Android application through which users can easily control the USV via Bluetooth and display the sensor and GPS data the platform generates. We validated the performance of the platform in terms of usability, mobility, and stability through field experiments in various locations, including both the USA and Peru. Moreover, we present a potential application and approach in which this platform can navigate autonomously by utilizing the Robot Operating System (ROS) and Bluetooth protocols. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Ultrasound diagnostic imaging is an essential aspect of modern healthcare, but barriers such as cost, technical training, and access to medical facilities impede global adoption. To tackle these factors, the need for a portable open-source three-dimensional ultrasound system is discussed. Such a system, equipped with artificial intelligence, can provide unparalleled global accessibility to life-saving affordable medical diagnostic care as well as create copious amounts of data needed for training automated systems; however, it may also carry disadvantages. This paper assesses the considerations for and against an open- source approach and draws insights from successful open-source hardware projects in the past. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - With the increasing number of electronic based systems being connected to the Internet via wired or wireless connections in the era of the IoT, the importance of security aspects is well recognized. At the same time growth of available complexity and increasing market share of reconfigurable integrated circuits make integration of whole digital systems feasible at relatively low cost. Placing security functions into reconfigurable logic might be advantageous in case of algorithm changes, bug fixes, or updates for hardening of the core against attacks. In this paper we thus want to give an overview of available open-source hardware security building blocks for basic cryptographic functions and show evaluation results of selected cores in FPGA technology. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - In order to provide dynamic adaptation of the performance/energy tradeoff, systems today rely on heterogeneous multicore architectures (different micro-architectures on a chip). These systems are limited to single-ISA approaches to enable transparent migration between the different cores. To offer more tradeoff, we can integrate statically scheduled micro-architecture and use dynamic binary translation (DBT) for task migration. However, in a system where performance and energy consumption are a prime concern, the translation overhead has to be kept as low as possible. In this paper, we present Hybrid-DBT, an open-source, hardware accelerated DBT system targeting VLIW cores. Three different hardware accelerators have been designed to speed-up critical steps of the translation process. Experimental study shows that the accelerated steps are two orders of magnitude faster than their software equivalent. The impact on the total execution time of applications and the quality of generated binaries are also measured. © 1982-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Recent progress in neuro-prosthetic technology gives rise to the hope that in the future blind people might regain some degree of visual perception. It was shown that electrically stimulating the brain can be used to produce simple visual impressions of light blobs (phosphenes). This technology, using electrodes placed on top of the visual cortex, was successfully used to give blind people some degree of visual impression of their surrounding. However, this perception is very far away from natural sight. For developing the next generation of visual prostheses, real-time closed-loop stimulators are required. Such a stimulator measures the actual neuronal activities and on this basis determines the required stimulation pattern. In addition, there is a desire to shrink the diameter of the applied electrodes and increase their spatial density. This leads to the challenge of designing a system that can produce arbitrary stimulation-patterns with up to ±70 V and with up to 25 mA while measuring neuronal signals with amplitudes in the order of mV. Furthermore, interruptions of the measurements during stimulation should be as short as possible and the system needs to scale to hundreds of electrodes. We discuss how such a system and especially its current pumps and input protection need to be designed and which problems arise. We condense our findings into an example design for which we provide all design files (boards, firmwares and software) as open-source. This is a first step in taking the existing open-sourcewww.open-ephys.org recording system and converting it into a closed-loop experimental setup for neuro-prosthetic research. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - We present a vertical integration of a real-time Industrial Internet of Things environment with Cloud computing functionalities. We designed our testbed to implement self-adaptive wings for motorbikes using pressure values sensed in specific locations of the motorbike as input data collected exploiting open-hardware devices called OpenMotes which communicate through a low-power, delay-constrained wireless network based on the 6LoWPAN protocol stack. Our real-time on-board unit elaborates the data, and it computes the new angle of attack of two wings. The total response time of the system is in the order of 100 ms and meets the real-time requirements that constrains our scenario. Finally, we integrate our system with Cloud functionalities that we use for storing the acquired data on a time-series database. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - In the present work, a modular and low-cost FPGA-based phased array system was developed that uses transducers emitting at 40 kHz for the acoustic levitation of small objects (≤ 4 mm). The system consists of a driver board, transducer arrays with various layouts, and software developed in MATLAB®. The software can be used to simulate the acoustic field, calculate acoustic traps, and control the driver board via a provided USB-SPI interface. The driver board controls up to 100 channels simultaneously with square-wave signals up to 20 Vpp with π/1024 phase resolution and 10 bit amplitude resolution. Several phased arrays can be linked via a provided I2C interface to increase the number of available channels. The functionality of the system is demonstrated by the levitation of small objects using a flat 40 kHz transducer array. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Heart rate data are often collected in human factors studies, including those into vehicle automation. Advances in open hardware platforms and off-the-shelf photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensors allow the non-intrusive collection of heart rate data at very low cost. However, the signal is not trivial to analyse, since the morphology of PPG waveforms differs from electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms and shows different noise patterns. Few validated open source available algorithms exist that handle PPG data well, as most of these algorithms are specifically designed for ECG data. In this paper we present the validation of a novel algorithm named HeartPy, useful for the analysis of heart rate data collected in noisy settings, such as when driving a car or when in a simulator. We benchmark the performance on two types of datasets and show that the developed algorithm performs well. Further research steps are discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The majority of bird and bat species are incapable of carrying tags that transmit their position to satellites. Given fundamental power requirements for such communication, burdened mass guidelines and battery technology, this constraint necessitates the continued use of very high frequency (VHF) radio beacons. As such, efforts should be made to mitigate their primary deficiencies: detection range, localization time and localization accuracy. The integration of a radiotelemetry system with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) could significantly improve the capacity for data collection from VHF tags. We present a UAV-integrated radiotelemetry system that relies on open source hardware and software. Localization methods, including signal processing, bearing estimation based on principal component analysis, localization techniques and test results, are discussed. Using a low-power beacon applicable for bats and small birds, testing showed that the improved vantage of the UAV-radiotelemetry system (UAV-RT) provided significantly higher received signal power compared to the low-level flights (maximum range beyond 1.4 km). Flight testing of localization methods showed median bearing errors between 2.3° and 6.8°, with localization errors of between 5% and 14% of the distance to the tag. In a direct comparison to an experienced radiotelemetry user, the UAV-RT system provided bearing and localization estimates with 53% less error. This paper introduces the core functionality and use methods of the UAV-RT system, while presenting baseline localization performance metrics. An associated website hosts plans for assembly and software installation. The methods of UAV-RT use for tag detection will be further developed in future works. For both the detection and localization problems, the mobility of a flying asset drastically reduces tracker time requirements. A 7-min flight would be sufficient to collect five equally spaced bearing estimates over a 1-km transect. The use of a software-defined radio on the UAV-RT system will allow for the simultaneous detection and localization of multiple tags. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Communications and data infrastructures are evolving in the most diverse views, ranging from the processing capacity, passing through wide geographic coverage, and finally to the resiliency and redundancy required in today's applications. However, physical problems such as excessive heat generation and increasing energy consumption continue to be increasingly present. Inspired by the evolution of the concept of Smart grids, we will approach the implementation of an integrated system for monitoring and measuring electricity consumption variables in data centers using open hardware and software libraries based on industry-wide standards such as Ethernet and the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). Such system is conceived as a basic element for the complete management of a physical Information and Communication Technology infrastructure, since data centers are highly complex elements connected to and representative of Smart grids. For validation, a field-tested hardware and software prototype was developed, one that was capable of performing non-invasive measurements of electric current in data centers and make the data available via network, either in a local infrastructure or in a distributed architecture. Therefore, it could be implemented from small local data centers to huge distributed projects like Smart Grids, securely, inexpensively and highly integrable with other tools and systems. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Recently, Electric Vehicles (EVs) have gained an important research relevance as a mean of transport efficient and sustainable. In this full research to practice paper, we expose the educational experience to develop the different nodes such as lighting system, driver-focused Human Machine Interface (HMI), battery balancing and air conditioning with solar panels for EOLO, the first Colombian (EV) with an additional system of charge through wind for the auxiliary batteries which guarantees the autonomy of the vehicle. Twelve students (n=12) have been enrolled into the methodology of Problem-Based Learning (PBL) to design and implement the mentioned nodes as part of a set of capstone projects. To technical level, each node has been designed using Digital Signal Controllers (dsPICs), the open hardware platform Arduino or FTDI 32-bit microcontrollers as the FT900Q according to the design requirements. Also, it has designed several educational materials in the e-learning tool Xerte and an Algorithm Visualization (AV) tool called DSCBlocks that supported the educational process of the students. The outcomes show that the methodology is suitable to fulfill with the technical and educational requirements of the projects because they enclosed different stages such as problem definition, design strategy, usage of previous knowledge, implementation, debugging and team working. In addition, an assessment of the educational methodology is provided in the manuscript with the discussion of its implications for learning in the students. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - The advent of Internet of Things - IoT - technology has elevated the embedded solutions employment to level never seen before, both in the problem-solving possibilities as in the complexity of the new systems. SoC-based computers such as those used in embedded systems have been under growing attention due to their low-cost, low-power, reduced footprint and high performance characteristics. These features allow small users as well as industries to design, develop and build wide range of applications with efficiency as the common aspect. A number of platforms that integrate this kind of technology were also proposed by different manufacturers, some employing the open hardware concept. Embedded applications spread over a wide range of fields, which make them hard to characterize in a general sense. For this reason, benchmark suites are often used as a tool for system's performance evaluation. However, such suites consist on a large number of different algorithms, which can spend time and energy to run on SoC computers. In order to contribute to the performance assessment of such systems, this paper presents a simple method for comparing different platforms, based on execution time of simple but representative algorithms: sorting, cross-correlation and discrete-cosine transform calculation for vectors. The power consumption was also considered. Six distinct architectures were used as a case study. Several computer experiments were conducted in order to make possible a statistic characterization of different load conditions in distinct platforms, so their comparison can be done in a meaningful way. Results show that the proposed method provides a good estimation of relative system performance, which can be useful as a criterion choice for selecting different embedded platforms. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Quality assurance detectors comprising cameras and a scintillator volume are of interest for use in spot scanning proton therapy due to its dynamic delivery. In this work, we aimed to image scanned proton beams with greater flexibility than is provided by previous systems by using an innovative camera triggering solution. The main objective was to synchronize image acquisitions with proton beam deliveries. A 3D detector composed of 3 scientific complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor cameras and a volumetric liquid scintillator (20 ×20× 20 cm)were used. We identified relevant signals from the synchrotron beam delivery system to trigger the cameras. These signals were processed using an open hardware microcontroller and monitored using an oscilloscope. We evaluated the camera triggering scheme by comparing the mean signal intensity and standard deviations for triggered versus non-triggered image acquisitions at 5 energies (161.6, 140.9, 124.0, 100.9, and 85.6 MeV)with 50 spots per energy. The performance of the triggering scheme was further investigated by testing the image intensity variability for 5 energies delivered at 9 different location (2 spots/location). We also measured the background signals for different exposure times (1–1000 ms)using both triggered and non-triggered schemes. The mean signal intensity difference between triggered and non-triggered schemes was 10% ± 0.4% for low SNR (∼20 dB). The image intensity variability was within 2%. The background signal intensity varied by only 0.6% from the shortest exposure time (1 ms)to the longest (1 s). We demonstrated a flexible triggering scheme using an open hardware microcontroller with a camera and scintillator detector system for a spot scanning proton beam, which will enable efficient machine quality assurance and treatment plan verification measurements in the future. © 2019

AB  - Recent advances in positional tracking systems for virtual and augmented reality have opened up the possibilities for ubiquitous motion capture technology in the consumer market. However, for many applications such as in performance art, athletics, neuroscience, and medicine, these systems remain too bulky, expensive, and limited to tracking a few objects at a time. In this work, we present a small wireless device that takes advantage of existing HTC Vive lighthouse tracking technology to provide affordable, scalable, and highly accurate positional tracking capabilities. This open hardware and open software project contains several elements, and the latest contributions described in this paper include: (1) a characterization of the optical distortions of the lighthouses, (2) a new cross-platform WebBLE interface, and (3) a real-time in-browser visualization. We also introduce new possibilities with an adaptive calibration to estimate transformation matrices of lighthouses, and an FPGA approach to improve precision and adaptability. Finally, we show how the new developments reduce setup costs and increase the accessibility of our tracking technology. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - This work demonstrates an open-source hardware and software platform for monitoring the performance of buildings, called Elemental, that is designed to provide data on indoor environmental quality, energy usage, HVAC operation, and other factors to its users. It combines: (i) custom printed circuit boards (PCBs) with RFM69 frequency shift keying (FSK) radio frequency (RF) transceivers for wireless sensors, control nodes, and USB gateway, (ii) a Raspberry Pi 3B with custom firmware acting as either a centralized or distributed backhaul, and (iii) a custom dockerized application for the backend called Brood that serves as the director software managing message brokering via Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol using VerneMQ, database storage using InfluxDB, and data visualization using Grafana. The platform is built around the idea of a private, secure, and open technology for the built environment. Among its many applications, the platform allows occupants to investigate anomalies in energy usage, environmental quality, and thermal performance via a comprehensive dashboard with rich querying capabilities. It also includes multiple frontends to view and analyze building activity data, which can be used directly in building controls or to provide recommendations on how to increase operational efficiency or improve operating conditions. Here, we demonstrate three distinct applications of the Elemental platform, including: (1) deployment in a research lab for long-term data collection and automated analysis, (2) use as a full-home energy and environmental monitoring solution, and (3) fault and anomaly detection and diagnostics of individual building systems at the zone-level. Through these applications we demonstrate that the platform allows easy and virtually unlimited datalogging, monitoring, and analysis of real-time sensor data with low setup costs. Low-power sensor nodes placed in abundance in a building can also provide precise and immediate fault-detection, allowing for tuning equipment for more efficient operation and faster maintenance during the lifetime of the building. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Data collection by conservation biologists is undergoing radical change, with researchers collaborating across disciplines to create bespoke, low-cost monitoring equipment from open-source hardware (OSH). Compared to commercial hardware, OSH dramatically reduces participation costs. Four barriers currently hold back its wide adoption: (1) user inexperience inhibits initial uptake; (2) complex and costly manufacturing/distribution procedures impede global dissemination; (3) lack of creator support results in lapsed projects; and (4) lack of user support degrades continued utility in the field. Here, we propose a framework to address these barriers, illustrating how OSH offers a route to rapid expansion of community-driven conservation action. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - In recent years, quadcopters have become popular research platforms in the fields of robotics and control engineering. As a response to the academic community's needs, several open-source hardware and software platforms have emerged with the aim to impose as de-facto development tools. One of these platforms is represented by Crazyflie 2.0, a nano class quadcopter that was used in research projects that span from control architecture designs to high-level swarm synchronization.This paper presents a study of the control architecture employed in the stock firmware. Based on the mathematical model, the dynamic behaviour is thoroughly evaluated to understand the deviation between ideal and real evolution. A comprehensive phase of parameters tuning is conducted and multiple scenarios for real-time testing are employed. These scenarios comply in tracking predefined patterns, the quadcopter's evolution being tracked via a RGB-D sensor.The proposed evaluation procedure can be easily replicated and represents a very important step in obtaining accurate real-time results. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - The posit number system is proposed as a replacement of IEEE floating-point numbers. It is a floating-point system that trades exponent bits for significand bits, depending on the magnitude of the numbers. Thus, it provides more precision for numbers around 1, at the expense of lower precision for very large or very small numbers. Several works have demonstrated that this trade-off can improve the accuracy of applications. However, the variable-length exponent and significand encoding impacts the hardware cost of posit arithmetic. The objective of the present work is to enable application-level evaluations of the posit system that include performance and resource consumption. To this purpose, this article introduces an open-source hardware implementation of the posit number system, in the form of a C++ templatized library compatible with Vivado HLS. This library currently implements addition, subtraction and multiplication for custom-size posits. In addition, the posit standard also mandates the presence of the 'quire', a large accumulator able to perform exact sums of products. The proposed library includes the first open-source parameterized hardware quire. This library is shown to improve the state-of-the-art of posit implementations in terms of latency and resource consumption. Still, standard 32 bits posit adders and multipliers are found to be much larger and slower than the corresponding floating-point operators. The cost of the posit 32 quire is shown to be comparable to that of a Kulisch accumulator for 32 bits floating-point. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - 802.15.4 Impulse Radio Ultra-Wide Band (IR-UWB) is a highly performant radio technology for indoor localization, which is very popular in industrial applications. However, off-the-shelf UWB IPS are not fully open, neither are they secured. From that observation, we developed SecureLoc, an open hardware and software platform designed towards reproducible localization and security experimentations. SecureLoc hardware is based on OpenWino open platforms, and features a multi-layers architecture that can support different protocols. We detail three localization algorithms implemented on the platform, and compare their results in normal and adversarial conditions. We show how weighted centroid algorithm is more robust than Gauss-Newton algorithm against attacks. © 2019 Radio Society.

AB  - The housing crisis has received growing interest from academia, industry, and policymakers. Open construction systems have emerged as a promising solution to achieve long-term social, economic, and environmental sustainability. In this paper, extensive fieldwork was conducted to investigate a case of an open construction system, namely, the WikiHouse Den Bosch. The research framework builds on a combined view of two main concepts: "conviviality" and "openness". The aim is to provide an in-depth understanding of the relationship between these two aspects and the literature regarding "Design Global Manufacture Local". The analysis showed that conviviality and openness are complex and context-specific factors. The paper concludes by outlining the need for an "institutionalized conviviality" to open up new pathways for future practice to address sustainability issues. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The use of animal-borne devices in wildlife studies is increasing due to the miniaturization of sensors and reductions in component costs. Retrieval of animal-borne devices is often advantageous for several reasons, including data retrieval and animal welfare considerations; however, commercially available drop-off units are often prohibitively expensive and/or unreliable. Here, we present ‘OpenDropOff’, an open-source, low-cost electronic drop-off unit for remotely detaching animal-borne sensors from individuals. OpenDropOff devices function by using heat, produced by running an electrical current through resistance wire (nichrome), to melt nylon (e.g. fishing) line, detaching sensors from animals at or after a pre-determined time. OpenDropOff can be constructed using commercially available components (costing < USD $15 in total; approximately 10% or less of many commercially available drop-off units) and can be customized to fit project- and species-specific needs. Fourteen OpenDropOff devices have been field deployed on koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) (n = 11), swamp wallaby (Wallabia bicolor) (n = 1), Australian brush turkey (Alectura lathami) (n = 1) and Australian white ibis (Threskiornis molucca) (n = 1), with the only detachment failure occurring after a device was damaged during the koala’s unrelated death. OpenDropOff devices provide a wider range of researchers with a reliable, cost-effective tool for detaching animal-borne sensors. Their use could allow researchers to more efficiently allocate project resources, and their flexibility provides an opportunity to mitigate animal welfare concerns surrounding the use of animal-borne devices. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - We report an easily assembled, high performance liquid/liquid separator constructed from a drilled-out block of aluminium, a short length of porous polytetrafluoroethylene tubing, and a small number of off-the-shelf components and 3D-printed parts. The separator relies on the two incoming liquids having different wettabilities to the wall of the porous capillary, with the more strongly wetting liquid leeching through the porous wall while the other liquid passes unhindered through the interior channel. To achieve complete separation of the two phases, the fluid streams at the separator outlets are monitored optically, and the back-pressure at one outlet is iteratively adjusted using a motorised needle valve until smooth time-invariant signals are recorded at both outlets. The separator may be applied to many pairings of immiscible liquids over a broad range of flow rates, automatically establishing complete separation within minutes of activation and adjusting dynamically to subsequent changes in the flow conditions. The separator-whose performance is competitive with far costlier commercial systems-is released here as open hardware, with technical diagrams, a full parts list, assembly instructions, and source code for its firmware. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The analysis of seismic noise provides a reliable estimation of the soil properties, which supposes the starting point for the assessment of the seismic hazard. The horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio technique calculates the resonant frequency of the soil just by using a single three-component sensor. Array measurements require at least several vertical sensors registering simultaneously and their analysis provides an estimation of the surface waves dispersion curve. Although these methods are relatively cheaper than other geotechnical techniques, the cost of the sensors and the multi-channel data acquisition system means that small research groups cannot afford this kind of equipment. In this work, two prototypes for registering seismic noise have been developed and implemented: a three-channel acquisition system, optimized for working with three-component sensors; and a twelve-channel acquisition system, prepared for working simultaneously with twelve vertical geophones. Both prototypes are characterized by being open-hardware, open-software, easy to implement, and low-cost. The main aim is to provide a data acquisition system that can be reproduced and applied by any research group. Both developed prototypes have been tested and compared with other commercial equipment, showing their suitability to register seismic noise and to estimate the soil characteristics. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - During the last decade, many climatic parameters are more and more deviating from the mean values calculated over historical climatic time-series. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) stated that years 2015, 2016 and 2017 were the warmest since 1850. According to the preliminary data analysis of the last year, this trend is going to continue in 2018 as well. These climatic changes have accelerated the occurrence of droughts in many parts of the world including Europe and Asia. The North Western region is one such region in Sri Lanka which always affected by droughts due to its inherent dry weather condition. Although drought is considered as a normal part of the climate, its increasing negative impacts on human activities and the environment urges the application of novel technologies in drought monitoring. The 4onse project (analysis of Open, Non-conventional, Sustainable and Effective monitoring systems), funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), is a project began in this context to address the aforementioned mentioned issues by deploying 27 open technologies based Environmental Monitoring Systems (EMS) in Deduru Oya basin of Sri Lanka. These systems measure weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, pressure, rainfall, wind speed and wind direction. Thanks to the collected data, it was possible to calculate some drought indexes to evaluate the intensity of the dry periods. The Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) has been selected as the principal indicator to evaluate droughts by integrating the 4onse data together with Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) dataset. © 2019.

AB  - The rapid evolution of intelligent electronic devices makes information technology, computer science and electronics strongly related to the teaching of natural sciences. Today almost everybody has a smart phone that can convert light, temperature, movement, sound to numbers, therefore all these can be processed, analysed, displayed, stored, shared by software applications. The fundamental question is how education can follow this knowledge and how can education take its advantages. Components and methods of modern technology are available for education also, teachers and students can play with parts and tools which were previously used only by engineers. A good example is the very popular Arduino board which is practically an industrial microcontroller whose pins are wired to easy-to-use connectors on a printed circuit board. In this paper we show a universal system which we have developed for the Arduino platform to support experimenting and understanding of the most fundamental principles of the operation of modern devices. We show our related educational concept and discuss the most important features of the system. Open source hardware and software are available and we provide a number of video tutorials as well. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - With regard to the growing number of older adults, it needs smart solutions for fall prevention. Especially at geriatric institutions, the risk of falling is very high and frequently leads to injuries, resulting in serious consequences. We present the Inexpensive Node for Bed Exit Detection (INBED), a comprehensive signaling system for fall prevention. The INBED system is based on a wireless sensor network infrastructure via IEEE802.15.4 and highly-specialized open hardware in-house developed wearable. The device, which will be attached to the patients, can detect several types of movement. Occurring events are forwarded to the nursing staff immediately by using the self-organizing and scalable network including wide area network integration. The system can help to relieve the staff while the personal freedom of movement and privacy of patients is increased. With this development, the energy-efficient, simple and intuitive mechanisms of proximity communication can be combined with broadband benefits. © 2019 International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) and IOS Press.

AB  - Open-source technology for supporting the Industry 4.0 has become the target of academic research in many sectors. This study reviewed the trends of open-source technology, its forms, and some industrial applications. As a case study using open-source hardware and software for the mining industry, this study proposed a low-cost environmental monitoring system for non-metallic underground mines to support mine safety and occupational health issues. The system was developed using open-source hardware, Arduino and 3D printer, to design the monitoring device. An open-source software, MIT App Inventor, was used for developing an Android application for smartphones to enable remote communication with the system. Field experiments were conducted at an underground tunnel and a non-metallic underground mining site to assess the performance of the system in both mobile and static modes, respectively. Although a few limitations related to the precision of the low-cost dust and gas sensors still exist, the findings of the experiments show that the mining industry can benefit from open-source technology deployment when considering cost factors. © 2019, Society for Mining, Metallurgy & Exploration Inc.

AB  - At present, various existing IoT (Internet of Things, IoT) comprehensive experimental platforms customized experimental toolboxes for specific goals. Therefore, they lack flexibility and scalability and applications are difficult to integrate with each other, which cannot meet the needs of new IoT application development. In response to this problem, this paper proposes an IoT comprehensive experiment and application development platform based on open source ecosystem, which provides support for IoT research, application development and teaching. Compared with traditional platforms, this platform has the end-To-end capabilities of the IoT architecture which is from device layer, transport layer to data processing and application development layer. This comprehensive experimental platform based on open source hardware and IoT middleware provides access for multiple heterogeneous devices and provides a semi-Automated physical entity and virtual resource mapping framework. The publish/subscribe model is used for providing data publishing and device management function and loosely coupled integration with multiple cloud platforms. This kind of IoT platform based on open source ecosystem reduces system development cost, improves system flexibility, and meets the diverse needs of practical experimental teaching. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - In the era of technological advances and innovations in transportation technologies, application of driving simulators for the investigation and assessment of the driving process provides a safe and suitable testing environment. Although driving simulators are crucial for further improvements in transportation, it is important to resolve one of their main disadvantages–simulator sickness. Therefore, suitable methods for the assessment of simulator sickness are required. The main aim of this paper was to present a non-invasive method for assessing simulator sickness by recording gastric myoelectrical activity–electrogastrography. Open-source hardware for electrogastrography together with recordings obtained in 13 healthy volunteers is presented, and the main aspects of signal processing for artifact cancellation and feature extraction were discussed. Based on the obtained results, it was concluded that slow-wave electrical gastric activity can be recorded during driving simulation by following adequate recommendations and that proposed features could be beneficial in describing non-ordinary electrogastrography signals. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Objectives: The Internet of Things (IoT) and its applications are growing simultaneously. These applications need new intelligent devices along heterogeneous networking. Which makes them costly to implement indeed. Platforms and open devices designed for open-source hardware are possible solutions. This research was conducted under an IoT design, implementation, and assessment model for the remote monitoring of pulse oximetry via oxygen partial saturation (SpO2) and heart rate (HR) with low-energy consumption. Methods: This study focused on the development of SpO2 and HR measurements that will allow the monitoring and estimation in real time of the user’s state and health related to the established parameters. Measurements were acquired and recorded using a remote web server that recorded the acquired variables for further processing. The statistical analysis data allows comparison of the registered data measured with theoretical models. Results: The IoT model was developed use Bluetooth low-energy devices, which comply with low-cost and open-hardware solutions operated via ‘HTTP requests’ for data transmission and reception from a cloud server to an edge device. Network performance assessment was conducted to guarantee the availability and integrity of the acquired values and signals. The system measured SpO2 and HR variables. The most significant result was to achieve energy consumption 20% lower than that of devices in the market. Conclusions: In summary, the acquired data validation based on the IoT model had a transmission error of 0.001% which proves its applicability in healthcare. © 2019 The Korean Society of Medical Informatics.

AB  - Embedded system today are influencing every sphere of life and all application domains. These systems were initially designed according to the application requirement as special hardware. This approach of embedded system design was influenced by particular family of processor. The new approach of embedded system design envisages the use of general purpose on the shelf hardware modules to be incorporated. These on the shelf hardware modules are also referred open source hardware platforms as their entire hardware module design in available in public domain. Thus populating such hardware platforms by different individuals becomes easy. At instances these open source modules are not as good as the original ones. This is because calculating and predicting the successes achieved or failure caused by the copy is not tested. This can be verified by the performance of the module designed in terms of reliability. © BEIESP.

AB  - The paper describes the possibilities of data acquisition and data processing from optical sensing systems. There are some data acquisition cards and their disadvantages when used for more complex single fiber sensor systems in the paper. It is suitable to use some open source hardware because commercially available data acquisition cards are more complex and universal which means they have several different inputs/outputs and large dimensions. STEMLab 125-14 (Red Pitaya) appears to be the most suitable solution because offers 2 analog inputs and 2 analog outputs. Compare to standard data processing systems, this is supposed to be an advantage in preprocessing data using programmable logic. This can reduce the volume of transmitted data and can also speed up processing. Thus, the measurement system will be smaller and cheaper. The device contains DA converters, therefore pulses might be generated using the same clock which enables synchronization of backscatter signal. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper, the authors design a wearable gesture recognition system that identifies the alphabetic gestures in the American Sign Language (ASL) efficiently, requiring minimal user calibration. The system uses a heterogeneous collection of sensors, viz., contact, flex and inertial, placed strategically on the hand to record movements and points of contact involved during gesture signing. In order to minimize user calibration, the authors propose a novel approach called as State-based gesture modelling, which requires only 7 gestures to be signed by a user to create a State-based model for all 26 alphabetic gestures in ASL for that user. A multi-stage gesture recognition algorithm, which uses the user-calibrated State-based model, is employed for gesture identification. The system was extensively tested for 2 trained and 1 amateur ASL signers for up to 150 times per gesture giving maximum efficiencies of 92% and 81% respectively, thus indicating the robustness of the system. The use of an elegant algorithm along with simple off-The-shelf sensors enabled the implementation of the entire system on an ATmega 328P micro-controller, resulting in a cost of 25 USD for a laboratory stage prototype. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - This paper provides the design of a novel open-hardware mini-bipedal robot, named Rapid-Prototyped Remote-Brain BiPed (RPBP), that is developed to provide a low-cost and reliable platform for locomotion and perception research. The robot is made of customized 3D-printed material (ABS plastic) and electronics, and commercial Robotics Dynamixel MX-28 actuators, as well as visual RGB-D and IMU sensing systems. We show that the robot is able to perform some locomotion/visual-odometry tasks and it is easy to switch between different feet designs, providing also a novel Center-of-Pressure (CoP) sensing system, so that it can deal with various types of terrain. Moreover, we provide a description of its control and perception system architecture, as well as our opensource software packages that provide sensing and navigation tools for locomotion and visual odometry on the robot. Finally, we briefly discuss the transferability of some prototype research that has been done on the developed mini-biped, to half or fullsize humanoid robots, such as COMAN or WALK-MAN. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the advantages of computer network have attracted the attention of technological experts. However, network security issues remain a challenge. Controlling Web traffic and preventing attack to Web server, especially DoS/DDoS, are tremendous in the current computing ecosystem. In this paper, we propose a solution for controlling connections of the inside as well as the outside of network systems by using an integrated hardware, which would be deployed at gateway of the networks. It is not only used to implement rules but also monitor the network traffic, especially for web traffic which is considered as the common type in the Internet. In our solution, we prefer to use the IP SLA to control the web traffic, rather proxy to set up rules as well as a data stream algorithm for fast detecting Hot-IPs to prevent attacks from outside networks to the inside servers. The proposed solution is trouble-free to use and enhance security in small medium networks as well. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - A key assumption conventionally made by flexible head-mounted eye-tracking systems is often invalid: The eye center does not remain stationary w.r.t. the eye camera due to slippage. For instance, eye-tracker slippage might happen due to head acceleration or explicit adjustments by the user. As a result, gaze estimation accuracy can be significantly reduced. In this work, we propose Grip, a novel gaze estimation method capable of instantaneously compensating for eye-tracker slippage without additional hardware requirements such as glints or stereo eye camera setups. Grip was evaluated using previously collected data from a large scale unconstrained pervasive eye-tracking study. Our results indicate significant slippage compensation potential, decreasing average participant median angular offset by more than 43% w.r.t. a non-slippage-robust gaze estimation method. A reference implementation of Grip was integrated into EyeRecToo, an open-source hardware-agnostic eye-tracking software, thus making it readily accessible for multiple eye trackers (Available at: www.ti.uni-tuebingen.de/perception). © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - We present our work at Columbia University teaching the design and programming of heterogeneous computing architectures with SLD methods. Over the past eight years, we have developed a new course, System-on-Chip Platforms, with the main goal of preparing students to contribute to the new economy of heterogeneous computing and open-source hardware. The course was one of the first nationwide to introduce the use of commercial high-level synthesis tools for the design of application-specific hardware accelerators. We also introduced the idea of structuring the final project as a design-space exploration contest that combines aspects of collaborative engineering and design for reusability. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - In Earth science, we must often collect data from sensors installed in remote locations. Retrieving these data and storing them can be challenging. Present options include proprietary commercial dataloggers, communication devices, and protocols with rigid software and data structures that may require ongoing expenses. While there are open-source solutions that include telemetry, such as EnviroDIY’s Mayfly, none presently generate real-time, remotely accessible workbooks (Aufdenkampe et al., 2017; EnviroDIY, 2018). The Openly Published Environmental Sensing (OPEnS) Lab developed the OPEnS Hub, a new approach to using low-power, open-source hardware and software to achieve real-time data logging from the field to the web. The Hub is an order of magnitude less expensive than commercial products, inherently modular and flexible, and aims to reduce technical barriers for users with little programming experience (DeBell, 2019). Data can be collected remotely using a host of transmission protocols to relay data from distributed in situ monitoring devices. The Hub mesh-networks with several nodes and backs up to an onboard microSD card. Telemetry options include 900 MHz Long Range Radio (LoRa) with up to 25 km range and Nordic Radio Frequency (nRF) for higher data rates (Feather, 2018). Ongoing transmissions from the Hub to the internet currently employ Ethernet with potential support for Wi-Fi and the cell network. The Hub engages a dynamic, low-latency portal to Google Sheets via the free Application Programming Interface (API), PushingBox, and an adaptable Google Apps Script. This framework was tested on 12 individual sensors nodes at remote sites in Oregon. This manuscript details our methods and evaluates PushingBox, Google Apps Script, Adafruit Industries’ open-hardware Feather development boards, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and the aforementioned modes of data transfer. © 2019 DeBell, Goertzen, Larson, Selbie, Selker and Udell.

AB  - A high sensitivity Kerr magnetometer (ΔI/I = 1/30) is presented, making use of open source hardware and software. By making time resolved measurements (up to 0.15 s/cycle) the signal quality has been greatly improved up to an order of magnitude, enabling us to compare our measurements with commercial vibrating sample magnetometers. We also present an additional setup to amplify the Kerr signal in a 25:1 scale, cleaning a large part of the electronic and trigger noise. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - It is presented here, how a rural community was engaged, through its local high school, on the design of a payload to be deployed through a stratospheric platform. In this particular case, low cost open source hardware was integrated to a High Altitude Balloon (HAB) Payload. The main purpose of this activity was to support STEM education in rural communities by encouraging high school students to design, build, test, operate and data process HAB Payloads. The learning of fundamentals of this type of technology as well as, the study of the previous art, the design of experiments, the wiring of sensors to a microcontroller board and the open source program coding were all valuable learning experience to students. As a result of the success of this activity, in supporting STEM education, made the local government initiate the process to include Space Education as part of the curriculum initiatives. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019

AB  - This Complete Evidence-based Practice paper outlines the benefits of incorporating Arduino activities into a first-year engineering class for students majoring in electrical engineering, bioengineering, undeclared engineering and mechanical engineering at Fairfield University. Arduino is an open-source hardware platform that has recently gained a wide following among students for its ease of utilization to build with it exciting interactive projects. Teaching first-year engineering classes is a challenge given the importance of these classes in providing a solid foundation in engineering education. The traditional highly demanding first-year engineering curriculum which focuses primarily on engineering thinking and problem solving with a limited content of basic skills is not inspiring to incoming students and can become overwhelming. For this reason, we will use the Arduino platform in this first-year engineering class to add more hands-on activities to the curriculum and bring the joy of achievement for students. Our goal is to add excitement to the Fundamentals of Engineering course by providing a hands-on and fun-to-learn environment designed to expose students to tools that will lead them to critical thinking, innovation, energy awareness, and problem-solving skills which will enable them to become part of a very competitive workforce in the future. Project-based courses attempt to resolve the tension between providing training in the fundamentals of engineering and problem solving by motivating and engaging students. Active learning in first year engineering courses is believed to improve retention and appeal to a diverse population of students [1]. We report on a two-year study using the Arduino platform to build a series of projects. We have used Arduino platform projects in two-course instances and present survey results describing student responses to learning with Arduino. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019.

AB  - Cybersecurity continues to be a growing priority for organizations of all sizes and industries. The threat landscape continues to rapidly evolve producing disastrous cyber attacks that are crippling their targets and debilitating the economy. These attacks continue to increase in frequency, scale, sophistication, and severity of impact. New attack vectors are persistently emerging and new exploit techniques are constantly gaining widespread adoption. Small businesses continue to experience lack of adequate solutions and resources to defend against and repel these attacks. We present a holistic open source software and hardware solution, that successfully implements securing the network architecture by using the “defense-in-depth” approach that ensures the elimination of single or dual point of potential vulnerability within a network. The Protectli FW108120 firewall, referred to as “The Vault” is used as first line of defense. It is a low power, fanless, durable, customizable small form factor PC. It utilizes a Celeron J1900 processor, 8 GB of DDR3 memory, a 120 GB mSATA SSD, and 4 Gigabit Ethernet ports. The community version of pfSense firewall will be utilized to run on the firewall. pfSense is a free and open source firewall and router, based on FreeBSD, that also features unified threat management (UTM), load balancing, and multi zone setup. pfSense implements, maintains, and polices our multi-zone topology, which is formed of a DeMilitarized Zone (DMZ), a trusted zone, and an untrusted zone. The DMZ achieves defense in depth by adding an extra layer of security beyond that of a single perimeter, separating an external network from directly referencing an internal network, and isolating a particular machine within a network. Thought the DMZ concept is not new, implementing it using stacked Single-Board Computers (SBC), offers an affordable and flexible, yet secure, network architecture specifically for startups, small businesses, an expansion office, or even home office. The selected single board computers are a combination of third generation Raspberry Pis and Rock64s. These boards provide a remarkable computational power, low energy consumption, light weight, a compact size secure solution, and resourceful community support. These boards will form the DMZ network servers and host services such as a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using Snort, a selection of honeypots for Secure Shell (SSH), web applications, packet sniffing, private web browsing capabilities via TOR (The Onion Router), LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP or Python or Perl) server, Virtual Private Network (VPN) server, and protected browsing via proxy service. The main goal of this educational project is to leverage the total holistic integration of open source hardware and software to provide an affordable and portable solution that could be promptly deployed in case of an emergency, as a part of an incident response plan (IRP), or in case it is needed for testing purposes. Implementing this project provides valuable hands-on security experience and best practices in network architecture and configuration. Additional security features, both in hardware and software, were added to the single-board computers to add additional hardened security layers. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019.

AB  - This paper shares nascent research on the organizing practices of feminist technology activists and open science hardware (OSH) developers who are concerned with how technologies (and subsequent knowledges about them) are defined, framed, further developed, shared, and in turn shape the worlds in which we live. They intend to bring a frame of reflexivity toward awareness of the politics imbued in technology as well as the often exclusionary cultures entangled therein. Further this research brings field work observations of these groups and their practices (designated as Study 1) into conversation with interviews of engineering education researchers (designated as Study 2). In that vein, this examination asks: What might an analysis of the practices and mindsets of feminist hacker and opensource science hardware groups contribute to the world of engineering education, specifically for educators interested in change-making strategies for creating a more equitable higher education environment that takes on issues of racism, sexism, heteronormativity, ableism, etc.? With a theoretical grounding in the work of Myles Horton and the Highlander Research and Education Center's theory of change, bell hooks' liberatory pedagogies, and social movement theory from a science and technology studies (STS) perspective, this paper aims to examine how current social movements in technology, specifically the organizing work of feminist hacker and tech collectives as well as those working with opensource science hardware, might inform changes to engineering practice via educational reform. Data collection for this work involves participant observation from four different meetings and discursive analysis of websites and promotional materials. The result is a multi-modal analysis which will then be brought into conversation with previous work on 32 interviews with engineering education practitioners who have identified issues in the discipline and are interested in enacting change in the higher institutional setting. Such work has implications for engineering education reform and organizing possibilities toward enabling educators to seed the changes they seek. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019

AB  - Mobile robots are playing a significant role in Higher Education science and engineering teaching, as they offer a flexible platform to explore and teach a wide-range of topics such as mechanics, electronics and software. Unfortunately the widespread adoption is limited by their high cost and the complexity of user interfaces and programming tools. To overcome these issues, a new affordable, adaptable and easy-to-use robotic platform is proposed. Mona is a low-cost, open-source and open-hardware mobile robot, which has been developed to be compatible with a number of standard programming environments. The robot has been successfully used for both education and research at The University of Manchester, UK. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - The Open Science Hardware (OSH) movement has been gaining momentum to make scientific instruments widely accessible through open-source blueprints or DIY kits which can be built for a fraction of the cost of their commercial counterparts. Even though the designs of OSH are freely and openly available over the internet, in most cases, building or assembling science equipment from online designs require knowledge and skills in areas such as digital fabrication and basic electronics. Due to this, some open science practitioners face a multitude of challenges when replicating or customizing those designs to be used in their science experiments.To this end, through ethnographic field work and participatory design, my doctoral research explores such practical challenges faced by open science practitioners and tries to create new mediums and workflows to support efficient and inclusive dissemination of OSH. © 2019 Author.

AB  - We present the developmental considerations, design, and deployment of an autonomous modular terrestrial rover for ice-sheet exploration that is inexpensive, easy to construct, and allows for instrumentation customization. The total construction cost for this rover is less than USD&thinsp;3000, approximately one-tenth the cost of existing platforms, and it can be built using facilities frequently available at academic institutions (machine shop, 3-D printer, open-source hardware and software). Instrumentation deployed on this rover can be customized; the rover presented in this study was equipped with a dual-frequency GPS receiver and a digital SLR camera for constructing digital elevation models using structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry. We deployed this prototype rover on the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream to map local variations in snow accumulation and surface topography. The rover conducted four autonomous missions based out of the East Greenland Ice-Core Project (EastGRIP) camp during July 2017, measuring surface elevation transects across the hazardous ice-stream shear margins. During these missions, the rover proved capable of driving over 20km on a single charge with a drawbar pull of 250N, sufficient to tow instrumentation of up to 100kg. The rover also acquired photographs that were subsequently used to construct digital elevation models of a site monitored for spatiotemporal variability in snow accumulation, demonstrating adequate stability for high-resolution imaging applications. Due to its low cost, low-power requirements, and simple modular design, mass deployments of this rover design are practicable. Operation of the rover in hazardous areas circumvents the substantial expense and risk to personnel associated with conventional, crewed deployments. Thus, this rover is an investigatory platform that enables direct exploration of polar environments considered too hazardous for conventional field expeditions. © Author(s) 2019.

AB  - In this paper we are going to illustrate and discuss the CNR-IRPI-GMG-T 1, a fixed-wing UAV designed and assembled by the GMG of the CNR-IRPI and based on a full open source platform. Thanks to its payload modularity (i.e.: optical or multispectral cameras, GNSS RTK positioning, action camera, etc.), the aircraft has been used in a large number of sites for geohazards monitoring and surveying. This low-cost solution has been recently upgraded with an open source technology both for First Person View (FPV) in full HD and to obtain telemetry over a 3G/4G network. This system has been developed in order to fly Beyond the Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) and to further extend the UAV range of application. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Advances in semiconductor miniaturization are an important driver for Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) since their invention in the 1980s. The increasing number of available on chip logic resources on one hand and on the other hand a decrease in part costs let the FPGA market grow steadily in recent years. It comes thus at no surprise that more and more microprocessors are integrated into programmable logic devices as they represent the central functionality in many digital systems. In parallel to these technological developments the open-source hardware community grew steadily in the last two decades. More than hundred open-source CPU cores can thus be found and selecting a core for a design project has to be done with care. In this work we thus want to focus on open-source 32-bit CPU IP cores suitable for FPGAs and which support the upcoming free and open RISC-V instruction set architecture that has some interesting advantages when compared to commercial CPU cores (as will be outlined in the paper). An overview on available projects and activities will be given and evaluation results for a selection of cores will be presented. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - With 40 million amputees living in poor countries with limited access to health care, there is a significant need for novel prosthetic solutions. This paper presents our preliminary results to develop sustainable prostheses for five upper-extremity amputee patients in Colombia, South America. We utilized a patient-centric methodology, engaging patients at every stage in an effort to increase their satisfaction with their prosthetic and to assess clinical usefulness. We identified patient-specific criteria and compared existing open source hardware systems using the Design Thinking methodology. Finally, we present these data to further the development of myoelectric prosthetics as part of cyber-physical systems. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - The aging of insulation materials in GIS leads to a series of electrical problems. As a fully enclosed device, GIS faces extremely complex repairing problems once an accident occurs comparing with the separated open equipment. The root cause of this problem is multifaceted, including not only the high voltage issues, but also the environmental factors in operation such as temperature, mechanical vibration, etc. All these lead to the aging of insulation materials and the failure of the equipment. Therefore, it is important to analyze the aging state of the GIS spacer, especially the GIS spacers in service. In this paper, to evaluate the aging state of the GIS spacer in service, the structural properties, as well as electrical performance of insulating material obtained from a GIS spacer served more than 15 years are characterized and compared with that of a new GIS spacer. To investigate the change in electrical properties, dielectric loss test, polarization current, surface resistance, and partial discharge measurement are delivered. And thermal characterizations including DSC, TGA and IR are also delivered to investigate the structure change of the insulation epoxy. The results show that the aging effect reduces the surface resistances and increases the dielectric loss, polarization current and partial discharge. And with the service time increases, the glass transition temperature and the thermal decomposition temperature of the GIS spacer declines. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - The use of unmanned aquatic surface vehicles as a tool for exploring and inspecting bodies of water, such as lakes and ponds is a research area of growing interest. However, using real aquatic vehicles to test and develop software and control systems is often not feasible for many researchers, due to the limited access to testing pools and the lack of availability of low-cost, off-the-shelf surface vehicles. An alternative is to utilise software simulations, but these can fail to test important system features, such as error characteristics of real sensors, on-board processing and the effect of external disturbances on the performance of positional control systems. The contribution of the present paper is a third method that allows the robot's full software system including real world sensors to be tested without the need for pool facilities. This is achieved by mapping the physics of an omnidirectional aquatic surface robot onto an omnidirectional ground vehicle. A dynamic model of the aquatic surface vehicle is deployed within an embedded control system on the ground vehicle, meaning that for a given command signal (applied force) the motion of the ground vehicle mimics the motion that would occur if it were a surface vehicle floating on a body of water. Validation tests demonstrate that the ground vehicle's dynamic behaviour matches well with that of a specific aquatic surface vehicle that was utilised in this study. However, by changing the dynamic model within the embedded control system, the ground vehicle is able to approximate the motion of any aquatic surface vehicle. The newly constructed ground robot is now an open-source and open-hardware platform. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper, a measurement device based on 'Open Source' components of hardware and software will be presented. This device has been used to measure voltages and currents of a low-voltage (LV) networks, on which a virtually unlimited number of sensors can be added, and the device is assembled of components available on electronic components Internet. The used hardware for this project is based on Arduino UNO R3 motherboard and peripheral sensors needed for measurement of the mentioned data. The Arduino motherboard is not only the sole peace of hardware, but it can also act as a Wi-Fi router for the devices and the laptop used for data presentation and server side computations. The server is programmed in Java programming language and is open source. Main goal was to make smart meter by the 'Do It Yourself' method spending as much less founds as it is possible, by keeping user friendly interface, data validity, accuracy of measurement and ease of use for final user. Data gathering is achieved in almost 1 ms which is excellent for custom made device. However, the measured values should be calculated to RMS values to be usable for energy analyzes and further processing of information. © 2019 University of Zagreb, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing (FER).

AB  - The advent of mobile and wearable computing technology has opened up tremendous opportunities for health and wellness applications. It is increasingly possible for individuals to wear devices that can sense their physiology or health-related behaviors, collecting valuable data in support of diagnosis, treatment, public health, or other applications. From a researcher's point of view, the commercial availability of these 'mHealth' devices has made it feasible to conduct scientific studies of health conditions and to explore health-related interventions. It remains difficult, however, to conduct systems work or other experimental research involving the hardware, software, security, and networking aspects of mobile and wearable technology. In this paper we describe the Amulet platform, an open-hardware, open-software wrist-worn computing device designed specifically for mHealth applications. Our position is that the Amulet is an inexpensive platform for research and education, and we encourage the mHealth community to explore its potential. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Internet of Things devices have spread to near ubiquity this decade. All around us now lies an invisible mesh of communication from devices embedded in seemingly everything. Inevitably some of that communication flying around our heads will contain data that must be protected or otherwise shielded from tampering. The responsibility to protect this sensitive information from malicious actors as it travels through the air then falls upon the standards used to communicate this data. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is one of these standards, the aim of this paper is to put its security standards to test. By attempting to exploit its vulnerabilities we can see how secure this standard really is. In this paper, we present steps for analyzing the security of BLE devices using open-source hardware and software. © 2019 Institute of Electronics and Information Engineers (IEIE).

AB  - Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Manipulators (UAMs) have shown promising potential in mobile 3-dimensional grasping applications, but they still suffer from some difficulties impeding their board applications, such as target detection and indoor positioning. For the autonomous grasping mission, the UAMs need ability to recognize the objects and grasp them. Considering the efficiency and precision, we present a novel oriented-object detection method called Rotation-SqueezeDet. This method can run on embedded-platforms in near real-time. Besides, this method can give the oriented bounding box of an object in images to enable a rotation-aware grasping. Based on this method, a UAM platform was designed and built. We have given the formulation, positioning, control, and planning of the whole UAM system. All the mechanical designs are fully provided as open-source hardware for reuse by the community. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme was validated in multiple experimental trials, highlighting its applicability of autonomous aerial rotational grasping in Global Positioning System (GPS) denied environments. We believe this system can be deployed to many potential workplaces which need UAM to accomplish difficult manipulation tasks. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Equipment shortages in Africa undermine Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Education. We have pioneered the LabHackathon (LabHack): a novel initiative that adapts the conventional hackathon and draws on insights from the Open Hardware movement and Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI). LabHacks are fun, educational events that challenge student participants to build frugal and reproducible pieces of laboratory equipment. Completed designs are then made available to others. LabHacks can therefore facilitate the open and sustainable design of laboratory equipment, in situ, in Africa. In this case study we describe the LabHackathon model, discuss its application in a pilot event held in Zimbabwe and outline the opportunities and challenges it presents. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Nano-size unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), with few centimeters of diameter and sub-10 Watts of total power budget, have so far been considered incapable of running sophisticated visual-based autonomous navigation software without external aid from base-stations, ad-hoc local positioning infrastructure, and powerful external computation servers. In this work, we present what is, to the best of our knowledge, the first 27g nano-UAV system able to run aboard an end-to-end, closed-loop visual pipeline for autonomous navigation based on a state-of-the-art deep-learning algorithm, built upon the open-source CrazyFlie 2.0 nano-quadrotor. Our visual navigation engine is enabled by the combination of an ultra-low power computing device (the GAP8 system-on-chip) with a novel methodology for the deployment of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We enable onboard real-time execution of a state-of-the-art deep CNN at up to 18Hz. Field experiments demonstrate that the system's high responsiveness prevents collisions with unexpected dynamic obstacles up to a flight speed of 1.5m/s. In addition, we also demonstrate the capability of our visual navigation engine of fully autonomous indoor navigation on a 113m previously unseen path. To share our key findings with the embedded and robotics communities and foster further developments in autonomous nano-UAVs, we publicly release all our code, datasets, and trained networks. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - European Robotics League (ERL) Emergency Robots is an outdoor robotics contest focusing on multidomain emergency response scenarios. In this context, the deployed robots are expected to fulfill land, underwater, and flying cooperative tasks which emulate real-world situations inspired by the 2011 Fukushima accident. Participation of the Tuscany Robotics Team at ERL Emergency Robots 2017 was deeply affected by damage to (and resulting unavailability of) the unmanned ground vehicle to be used in the competition. This damage occurred 3 days before the challenge. An entirely new working mobile platform was built from scratch using a low-cost chassis. It was able to compete with the other participants in the challenge and achieved various tasks ~83% of the tasks completed by the best performer). The paper provides a complete description of the work carried out and the system used during the competition. The development was based on low-cost solutions, in particular: Adoption of open-hardware and open-software technology, providing cheap and fast-prototyping solutions. Use of smartphones, allowing sophisticated sensors to be exploited in an affordable way. Employment of Cloud infrastructures, to reduce the computational burden of offloading heavy processes. Results of this experience represent a concrete demonstration, showing that even low-cost solutions can achieve complex tasks, such as those required for the European robotic competition. The presented lessons learned aim to provide guidelines useful for reacting to unexpected events. Finally, the team was honored with the Creativity Award “for building a land robot from scratch in less than 2 days when their ground platform broke.”. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - We describe a completely open source system for performing experiments in multi-robot construction in laboratory settings. The system consists of robots that are capable of assembling cubic blocks into structures, which can be up to three blocks in height. The building material contains microcontrollers and multi-color light-emitting diodes (LEDs) that can be programmed by the robots using a near-field communication (NFC) interface. This mechanism is implemented to facilitate experiments where the intelligence that coordinates the construction can be embedded not only in the robots but also in the building material. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - A low-cost open-source wideband current sensor, measuring currents in a frequency range from DC to 5 MHz, is proposed. The sensor provides galvanic isolation, low insertion impedance, and can be used together with an oscilloscope as replacement for an expensive current probe, or as circuit integrated sensor, to measure currents with peak values up to 20 A. The hardware of the sensor consists of standard parts soldered on a printed circuit board; no special custom parts and/or manufacturing steps are needed to build. Applications are general measurement and laboratory use, e.g. measuring current waveforms in lab experiments. But the sensor can also be integrated in control circuits requiring measurements of time varying currents, e.g. for high speed current mode control in power electronics. © 2019 The Author

AB  - Presented here is a new bench-top research device for the measurement of the optical turbidity of natural sediment-laden water samples. This prototype device employs 18 unique angular measurement positions and a variety of user-selectable LED light sources. The motivation for this project was the need to generate more parameter-rich data sets pertaining to the light-scattering properties of natural sediment suspensions, and to address the issues raised by Kitchener et al. (2017) concerning the inconsistent calibration methodologies currently employed to quantify suspended sediment concentration (SSC) by optical turbidity measurement. The mechanical design comprises re-purposed waste plastic materials and 3D-printed parts. The active light-source control and monitoring hardware and firmware executes on the open-source Arduino embedded microcontroller platform. The modular light sensors plug into any of the angular measurement positions, providing a 0–5 V nominal output signal, which is readable by the user's choice of data-acquisition system. The device will facilitate the highly detailed characterization of suspended sediment samples, providing 18 voltage output channels for analysis by the user. The precise calibration of the light sensors is by the use of neutral density (ND) filters in conjunction with light-source electrical current measurements, providing light-source intensity values as required. The empirical data provided by existing turbidity meters are acquired using incommensurate methodologies, and therefore they are not cross-comparable. A new methodology, described here, facilitates the cross-comparability of turbidity measurements. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - This paper presents an open source framework called Creamino. It consists of an Arduino-based cost-effective quick-setup EEG platform built with off-the-shelf components and a set of software modules that easily allow users to connect this system to Simulink or BCI-oriented tools (such as BCI2000 or OpenViBE) and set up a wide number of neuroscientific experiments. Creamino is capable of processing multiple EEG channels in real-time and operates under Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X in real-time on a standard PC. Its objective is to provide a system that can be readily fabricated and used for neurophysiological experiments and, at the same time, can serve as the basis for development of novel BCI platforms by accessing and modifying its open source hardware and software libraries. Schematics, gerber files, bill of materials, source code, software modules, demonstration videos, and instructions on how to use these modules are available free of charge for research and educational purposes online at https://github.com/ArcesUnibo/creamino. Application cases show how the system can be used for neuroscientific or BCI experiments. Thanks to its low production cost and its compatibility with open-source BCI tools, the system presented is particularly suitable for use in BCI research and educational applications. © 1964-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Testbeds are a key tool for evaluating and benchmarking IoT solutions. Several public testbeds are being run by institutions around the world. These are built with a variety of tools, and are typically 'heavy' installations with dedicated wiring, hard installations, switches, servers, and a reservation and experiment management back-end. To complement those, we have taken the opposite, minimalistic, approach in designing the OpenTestBed. The OpenTestBed features all the tools necessary to build a testbed from off-the-shelf components such as Raspberry Pi single-board computers, OpenMote B low-power wireless devices, and glass domes. Each TestBox in the testbed connects to an MQTT broker over WiFi, no dedicated wiring or back-end is needed. The Inria-Paris OpenTestBed testbed of 80 motes has cost only 9,480 euros, and is open-access. The OpenTestBed is a fully open-source and open-hardware project, which several institutions have already adopted. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Ultra-wideband (UWB) localization is one of the most promising approaches for indoor localization due to its accurate positioning capabilities, immunity against multipath fading, and excellent resilience against narrowband interference. However, UWB researchers are currently limited by the small amount of feasible open source hardware that is publicly available. We developed a new open source hardware platform, Wi-PoS, for precise UWB localization based on Decawave’s DW1000 UWB transceiver with several unique features: support of both long-range sub-GHz and 2.4 GHz back-end communication between nodes, flexible interfacing with external UWB antennas, and an easy implementation of the MAC layer with the Time-Annotated Instruction Set Computer (TAISC) framework. Both hardware and software are open source and all parameters of the UWB ranging can be adjusted, calibrated, and analyzed. This paper explains the main specifications of the hardware platform, illustrates design decisions, and evaluates the performance of the board in terms of range, accuracy, and energy consumption. The accuracy of the ranging system was below 10 cm in an indoor lab environment at distances up to 5 m, and accuracy smaller than 5 cm was obtained at 50 and 75 m in an outdoor environment. A theoretical model was derived for predicting the path loss and the influence of the most important ground reflection. At the same time, the average energy consumption of the hardware was very low with only 81 mA for a tag node and 63 mA for the active anchor nodes, permitting the system to run for several days on a mobile battery pack and allowing easy and fast deployment on sites without an accessible power supply or backbone network. The UWB hardware platform demonstrated flexibility, easy installation, and low power consumption. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Currently, intelligent solutions that integrate lighting systems, security and automated environments give rise to new ways to optimize resources; and in this way facilitate everyday tasks in order to improve the quality of life. This study is based on a technical analysis of automated lighting systems, where the programmable mechanisms for different fixed actions in a specific time or even react in a certain way to a stimulus or external signal, thanks to specific sensors. Said actions were embodied in the design and construction stage of a microelectronic control panel with human machine interface and equipped with wireless communication to a mobile application, all based on free hardware. It is important to mention that prior to the development of the application, a diagnostic analysis of the physical space situation to intervene, was carried out. © 2019, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao.

AB  - In this work, a new approach for Sun tracking systems is presented. Due to the current system limitations regarding costs and operational problems, a new approach based on low cost, computer vision open hardware and deep learning has been developed. The preliminary tests carried out successfully in Plataforma solar de Almería (PSA), reveal the great potential and show the new approach as a good alternative to traditional systems. The proposed approach can provide key variables for the Sun tracking system control like cloud movements prediction, block and shadow detection, atmospheric attenuation or measures of concentrated solar radiation, which can improve the control strategies of the system and therefore the system performance. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Computational methods for the enhancement of energy efficiency rely on a measurement process with sufficient accuracy and number of measurements. Networked energy meters, energy monitors, serve as vital link between energy consumption of households and key insights that reveal strategies to achieve significant energy savings. During the design of such an energy monitor, several aspects such as data update rate or variety of measured physical quantities have to be considered. This paper introduces YoMoPie, a user-oriented energy monitor based on the Raspberry Pi platform that aims to enable intelligent energy services in households. YoMoPie measures active as well as apparent power, stores data locally, and integrates an easy to use Python library. Furthermore, the presented energy monitor comes with a Python API enabling the execution of user-designed services to enhance energy efficiency in buildings and households. Along with the presented design, possible applications that could run on top of this system such as residential demand response, immediate user feedback, smart meter data analytics, or energy disaggregation are discussed. Finally, a case study is presented, which compares the measurement accuracy of YoMoPie to a certified energy analyser for a selection of common household appliances. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - This full paper proposes an educational methodology to teaching and learning of programming using both open hardware tools and industrial components such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, three phase motors and variable speed drives. The methodology aims to improve the algorithmic thinking in the students due to the deficiencies detected in it, as well as, it searches that the students learn a second programming language, using hands-on designs and activities that require the components mentioned. In addition, the methodology has been employed into the curriculum of a course of programming known as (open hardware) for students of technology in electronics (n = 22), observing that the students learn programming concepts in a better way and their motivation and engagement towards the software area was increased during the course. To technical level, the methodology uses the programming language Python in order to interact with the different ports, peripherals and utilities of the platforms mentioned, creating a link between these elements and the aspects concerning the software design, e.g., data types, classes, methods or Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). Finally, the methodology takes into account two important aspects, firstly, the skills developed by the students in the proposal are involved into the BoK (Body of Knowledge) of different engineering areas as embedded systems, control and computer science and, secondly, programming is perhaps one of the most difficult areas in engineering but in turn, it has a ubiquitous nature in the areas mentioned. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Computer education is in the midst of a major transformation as a result of the rapid emergence of new technologies, intersection of computing with other disciplines and growing interest among students in computing courses. Such transformation prompted educators to redefine the way computing education is delivered and experiment a wide range of learning approaches. One of these approaches is the integration of hardware prototyping platforms such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi and Intel Internet of Things as part of project-based learning. These platforms have become in recent years instrumental tools for improving students' learning process and promoting proactive thinking. The aim of this study is to investigate the usefulness of integrating low cost open-source hardware platforms into engineering and computer science courses. In particular, we explore the use of an experiential learning approach using these kits for improving the students' learning experience in computer science and engineering courses. Throughout this paper, we discuss the outcome of our investigation and provide insights on how to make classrooms more experiential using the hardware prototyping paradigm. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents the design and hardware implementation of open-source hardware dedicated to smart converter systems development. Smart converters are simple or interleaved converters. They are equipped with controllers that are able to online impedance match for the maximum power transfer. These conversion systems are particularly feasible for photovoltaic and all renewable energies systems working in continuous changing operating conditions. Smart converters represent promising solutions in recent energetic scenarios, in fact their application is deepening and widening. In this context, the availability of a hardware platform could represent a useful tool. The platform was conceived and released as an open hardware instrument for academy and industry to benefit from the improvements brought by the researchers’ community. The usage of a novel, open-source platform would allow many developers to design smart converters, focusing on algorithms instead of electronics, which could result in a better overall development ecosystem and rapid growth in the number of smart converter applications. The platform itself is proposed as a benchmark in the development and testing of different maximum power point tracking algorithms. The designed system is capable of accurate code implementations, allowing the testing of different current and voltage-controlled algorithms for different renewable energies systems. The circuit features a bi-directional radio frequency communication channel that enables real-time reading of measurements and parameters, and remote modification of both algorithm types and settings. The proposed system was developed and successfully tested in laboratory with a solar module simulator and with real photovoltaic generators. Experimental results indicate state-of-art performances as a converter, while enhanced smart features pave the way to system-level management, real-time diagnostics, and on-the-flight parameters change. Furthermore, the deployment feasibility allows different combinations and arrangements of several energy sources, converters (both single and multi-converters), and modulation strategies. To our knowledge, this project remains the only open-source hardware smart converter platform used for educational, research, and industrial purposes so far. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Although waste stabilization ponds (WSPs) are widely used in developing countries, monitoring data on their operational performance are scarce. Traditional methods for monitoring in-pond conditions, i.e. conducting hand held measurements from a small boat or installing fixed sensor networks, are not straightforward to realize and create an unhealthy working environment for field workers. A promising technology for the safe and efficient collection of monitoring data is a compact autonomous surface vehicle (ASV), capable of autonomous navigation along a predefined trajectory based on geographic coordinates and measurements in different places and depths. In this practical paper, the development process, technical details and functional testing results of a low-cost ASV for WSP monitoring are presented. Commonly available construction materials and electronic components were used to ensure affordability and reparability. The access to online tutorials and peer-support was crucial for assembling the open-source autopilot and data logger. The ASV demonstrated satisfactory performance for both the autonomous navigation as well as the georeferenced data logging of measurements at a real-scale WSP in Paraguay. This study demonstrates how the adoption of open-source hardware and software offers the flexibility for the wastewater professionals to develop customized DIY solutions for specific monitoring applications and working environments. © IWA Publishing 2019.

It involved reverse engineering of a blood glucose meter, along with augmentation of features implemented in custom software. An app was created in order to access carbohydrate intake based on dietary consumption, which enables comparison to a diabetic's daily glucose level readings. Projections of biometric trends, along with identification of foods that are helpful or to avoid, can provide important feedback to the user about their personal choices. Pharmaceutical companies are increasingly limiting access to this data, so the open model is encouraged as it provides more customization and greater understanding to the user. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - The use of open software and hardware in STEM education is advantageous due to cost effectiveness and ready availability of design and implementation information. This project, performed as part of the NJ Governor's STEM research competition, involved reverse engineering of a blood glucose analysis meter along with augmentation of features implemented in custom software. An app was created in order to access carbohydrate intake based on dietary consumption, which would then be compared to a diabetic's daily glucose level readings.

Pharmaceutical companies are increasingly limiting access to this data, so the open model is encouraged as it provides more customization and greater understanding to the user.This project can be implemented over the course of a school semester, with one or more teams of 4-6 high school or early college students working in an engineering laboratory setting. The cost of parts is under $50.00, plus a programmable microcontroller. Skills learned include: circuit reading, circuit design, parts ordering, breadboarding, soldering, database construction and management, programming language learning, microcontroller integration, and software and application design and programming. The set of tasks can be divided up among the students, but results should be shared during final implementation in order that all can benefit from what was accomplished. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Cosmic rays represent not only a significant health risk to the crew of spacecraft and aircraft but also a fundamental phenomenon of basic research on the origin and composition of the universe. High-energy atmospheric physics is a newly opened research domain which focuses on research of terrestrial gamma-ray flashes that can measurably contribute to the aircraft-crew irradiation according to the preliminary computer simulations. High-mountain observatories are suitable places for both the con-tinual monitoring of cosmic radiation and the detection of ionizing radiation generated by lightning. Liulin Mobile Dosimetry Unit (MDU) is a silicon diode based radiation dosimeter developed by the team of Tsvetan Dachev at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, initially for the MIR space station. It is widely used as an instrument for radiation monitoring on board aircraft, on high altitude observatories as well as for example for ion fragmentation studies. The AIRDOS dosimeter is an open source device for measurement in low intensity mixed ionising radiation fields. In its aircraft version, it houses silicon PIN diode as a radiation detector, an electronics for conversion of the signal to the pulse-height spectra, Global Positioning System (GPS) module, memory card and batteries for one-month monitoring. The hardware design of AIRDOS is built on the Open Hardware modular platform MLAB, the firmware is written in Open Software platform Processing. Full documentation is freely available. Two AIRDOS de-vices have been installed at Basic Enviromental Observtory (BEO) Moussala in December 2017, complementing the radiation and environment monitoring instruments already available, including the Liulin MDU. Preliminary results of comparative measure-ments of radiation environment at BEO Moussala using the AIRDOS units and Liulin MDU will be presented. The results from BEO Moussala will be compared with data acquired on board aircraft. © 2019 Author(s).

AB  - The complexity and heterogeneity of digital devices used in embedded systems is increasing everyday and delivering a bug-free design is still a very complex task. The interest for open-source hardware in real products is demanding for tools and advanced methodologies for verification to provide high reliability to open and free IPs. In this work, an open-source evolutionary optimizer has been used to create functional test programs that improve the verification test set for an open-source microprocessor, enhancing in this way, the verification level of the device. The verification programs are generated to optimize code coverage metrics and are tested against a high-level model to find device incorrectnesses during the generation time. A perturbation mechanism has been included in the verification framework to cover parts of the device under verification not reachable with only software stimuli such as interrupts or memory stalls. The proposed methodology uncovered 10 bugs still present in the RTL description of the analyzed device and demonstrated the effectiveness of open-source verification tools for the next generation of open-source RISC-V microprocessors. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - This article presents an innovative and low-cost solution for optimizing the acquisition of performance data of small-laboratory-scale photovoltaic devices. A novel measuring setup is proposed, designed based on an Arduino microcontroller and low-cost components, coupled with open source hardware and software. The manuscript describes in detail the instrument design, components and assembly enabling the reproduction and customization of the instrument for any reader. The setup is combined with an optional web-platform, which enables fast analysis and comparison of the collected data. For the demonstration of the instrument in operation, comparison of measurements of solar cell with the developed setup and commercial products has been conducted. It is shown that the presented prototype provides values of accuracy and precision during I-V curve recording, comparable with the values measured using a commercial source-meter (Keithley 2400). The study also discusses the unique advantages of easy transport and data collection by the setup and the drawbacks in the hardware, which have been observed during a round robin study. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - An important challenge for our society is the transformation of traditional power systems to a decentralized model based on renewable energy sources. In this new scenario, advanced devices are needed for real-time monitoring and control of the energy flow and power quality (PQ). Ideally, the data collected by Internet of Thing (IoT) sensors should be shared to central cloud systems for online and off-line analysis. In this paper openZmeter (oZm) is presented as an advanced low-cost and open-source hardware device for high-precision energy and power quality measurement in low-voltage power systems. An analog front end (AFE) stage is designed and developed for the acquisition, conditioning, and processing of power signals. This AFE can be stacked on available quadcore embedded ARM boards. The proposed hardware is capable of adapting voltage signals up to 800 V AC/DC and currents up to thousands of amperes using different probes. The oZm device is described as a fully autonomous open-source system for the computation and visualization of PQ events and consumed/generated energy, along with full details of its hardware implementation. It also has the ability to send data to central cloud management systems. Given the small size of the hardware design and considering that it allows measurements under a wide range of operating conditions, oZm can be used both as bulk metering or as metering/submetering device for individual appliances. The design is released as open hardware and therefore is presented to the community as a powerful tool for general usage. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Conservation researchers require low-cost access to acoustic monitoring technology. However, affordable tools are often constrained to short-term studies due to high energy consumption and limited storage. To enable long-term monitoring, energy and space efficiency must be improved on such tools. This paper describes the development and deployment of three acoustic detection algorithms that reduce the power and storage requirements of acoustic monitoring on affordable, open-source hardware. The algorithms aim to detect bat echolocation, to search for evidence of an endangered cicada species, and also to collect evidence of poaching in a protected nature reserve. The algorithms are designed to run on AudioMoth: a low-cost, open-source acoustic monitoring device, developed by the authors and widely adopted by the conservation community. Each algorithm addresses a detection task of increasing complexity, implementing extra analytical steps to account for environmental conditions such as wind, analysing samples multiple times to prevent missed events, and incorporating a hidden Markov model for sample classification in both the time and frequency domain. For each algorithm, we report on real-world deployments carried out with partner organisations and also benchmark the hidden Markov model against a convolutional neural network, a deep-learning technique commonly used for acoustics. The deployments demonstrate how acoustic detection algorithms extend the use of low-cost, open-source hardware and facilitate a new avenue for conservation researchers to perform large-scale monitoring. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - IoT is much more than a large number of objects or customer devices connected to the Internet. IoT offers organizations many more opportunities than they can imagine. According to this, sooner or later they will probably choose to build their own IoT network. In this article, we review the technologies of IoT LPWAN Sigfox and LoRa. It can be considered the most important at present due to its ability to make the smart city possible. We also propose the development, deployment and implementation of a mixed IoT architecture LoRa-Sigfox composed of components based on open hardware and software. The architecture is evaluated in a real environment focused on remote monitoring of water meter devices. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Traditional manufacturing systems consist of devices with limited functionality and are constructed in a vertical structure. This is not suitable for smart factory environment where Internet of Things (IoT) is actively utilized and connected to external environment. Cyber Physical System (CPS), a key element of the Smart Factory, means that cyber and physical systems are tightly connected and intelligent. To build a CPS, IoT needs to be handled effectively, and stability and connectivity must be ensured. Therefore, the system in the Smart Factory is preferably built according to the IoT standard. In this paper, we propose an industrial device monitoring and control system based on oneM2M, and discuss that this system can be applied in a smart factory environment. The proposed system is based on Mobius, developed by Korea Electronics Technology Institute (KETI) as an open source IoT platform, and its components are open source hardware which is high performance with low cost. The Smart Factory system can be constructed in various forms using Mobius. In this paper, a model for its structure and utilization is presented. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Computer Numerical Control is a technology made up of several blocks. The single most important of these blocks is the Control Unit, responsible for performing security checks, user interface, coordinating the motion, file handling and coordinating several peripherals usually used on CNC applications. Over the course of last years, embedded systems presented a huge improvement in processing power as well as easiness of use and application, given the advances in the open source and open hardware development community. The present paper presents the development process of a high-end embedded system based CNC controller, capable of operating including motion constraints up to the fourth order time derivative of position for each of the individual Cartesian axis. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - In developing countries like India, the school and college education systems are mired in the passive, teacher-centric pedagogy based on rote learning. Active, student-centric STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art and math) learning can be achieved through extremely affordable open source hardware and free open source software to foster innovation and creativity among teachers and students in colleges and universities as well as schools. In particular, build your own and do-it-yourself (BYO/DIY) robots and tabletop subtractive and additive manufacturing machines can be designed, fabricated and disseminated for hands-on education in design, electronics, programming, robotics and manufacturing. This paper discusses an ongoing collaborative project between a higher educational institution, a non-profit foundation and a corporate sponsor to establish and operate project-based STEAM learning labs in resource-poor government high schools in nine Indian cities. The work reported is the schools outreach part of a Teaching Learning Centre for design, development and dissemination of low-cost manufacturing education technologies for engineering colleges and universities. The methodology can be replicated with locale-specific adaptations in schools elsewhere. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Small-animal MRI is an important investigative tool for basic and preclinical research. High-resolution anatomical and functional studies of the brain require artifact-free images that are acquired with a highly sensitive radiofrequency (RF) coil. New Method: The animal holder plays an important role in mitigating image artifacts: motion artifacts are reduced by immobilizing the animal and geometric-distortion artifacts are reduced by accurately positioning the animal to improve static-field shimming. The RF coil, in turn, must provide high sensitivity over the whole brain and not physically interfere with the animal holder. To accomplish these tasks, the animal holder and RF coil should be designed in tandem. In this manuscript, animal holders and RF coils for mice, rats, and marmoset monkeys are described. Each animal holder includes components for anesthesia delivery and animal immobilization, as well as a compatible receive coil. Results/Comparison with Existing Method(s): Animal holders were capable of accurate and reproducible positioning (for the marmoset, this was in the stereotactic plane), consequently reducing geometric distortion in echo-planar images. Ear bars were designed in conjunction with receive-coil formers, thereby maximizing the sensitive region of coils, while concurrently reducing motion to less than a pixel over EPI time series. Motion and SNR were quantified to facilitate direct comparison to existing animal holders and RF coils. All computer-aided-design (CAD) files of animal holders and RF coils are provided to promote dissemination. Conclusions: The confluence of design between the animal holder and RF coil provides a pragmatic solution for routine imaging of small animals. © 2018

AB  - Combining fluorescence and transmitted light sources for microscopy is an invaluable method in cellular neuroscience to probe the molecular and cellular mechanisms of cells. This approach enables the targeted recording from fluorescent reporter protein expressing neurons or glial cells in brain slices and fluorescence-assisted electrophysiological recordings from subcellular structures. However, the existing tools to mix multiple light sources in one-photon microscopy are limited. Here, we present the development of several microcontroller devices that provide temporal and intensity control of light emitting diodes (LEDs) for computer controlled microscopy illumination. We interfaced one microcontroller with µManager for rapid and dynamic overlay of transmitted and fluorescent images. Moreover, on the basis of this illumination system we implemented an electronic circuit to combine two pulsed LED light sources for fast (up to 1 kHz) ratiometric calcium (Ca 2+ ) imaging. This microcontroller enabled the calibration of intracellular Ca 2+ concentration and furthermore the combination of Ca 2+ imaging with optogenetic activation. The devices are based on affordable components and open-source hardware and software. Integration into existing bright-field microscope systems will take ∼1 day. The microcontroller based LED imaging substantially advances conventional illumination methods by limiting light exposure and adding versatility and speed. © 2019 Battefeld, Popovic, van der Werf and Kole.

AB  - Analyzing value creation and capture mechanisms of open source hardware startup companies, this paper illustrates how an open source strategy can make economical sense for hardware startups. By interviewing 37 open source hardware company leaders, 12 company community members as well as analyzing forum data of 3 open source hardware companies; we realize that by open sourcing the design of hardware, a company can naturally establish its community, which is a key element for a company's success. Establishing a community can increase customer perceived value, decrease product development and sales cost, shorten product go-to-market time, and incubate startups with knowledge, experience and resources. These advantages can compensate for the risks associated with open source strategies and can make open source design a viable product development strategy for hardware startups. © 2019 Design Society.

AB  - The success of many open source software projects revealed the power of voluntary collaborative production of large/complex software systems. The research community is therefore curious about the viability of open source projects in other areas. In around 2000, open source practices started to take place in the commercial hardware realm, and so far, the phenomenon has not been fully explored. Using grounded theory, the authors studied 31 firms for an average of 2.3 years, discovering a 4-phase growth pattern of open source hardware firms, including starting the firm, identifying core competencies, business model improvement and business maturation. The firms’ behaviors in each stage are reported, as well as the evolution of community demography, behaviors and impact in different growth phases. Copyright © 2019 ASME.

AB  - Free contributors have successfully shown the potential in large/complex software co-creation in the Free and Open Source Software Movement, triggering many discussions and exploration ventures from academia to industry and to the government. Though many research efforts explored whether the same level of co-creation efforts could take place broadly in the hardware realm, very few research studies focus on profit-seeking hardware projects initiated by companies. In fact, the specific nature of being tangible and profitable makes company-led open source hardware projects suspicious to be really “open” to contributors. Community has been identified as the critical driver in many open projects. By reviewing the evolution of company-community interactions over time and different community behaviors in different open development context, authors in this paper hope to identify best community-company interaction forms for open source hardware companies. Using grounded theory and case studies, we construct a framework to describe and identify company community's different behaviors and different roles. © 2019 Design Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Open source paradigm is becoming widely accepted in scientific communities and open source hardware is finding its steady place in chemistry research. In this review article, we provide the reader with the most up-to-date information on open source hardware and software resources enabling the construction and utilization of an “open source capillary electrophoresis instrument”. While CE is still underused as a separation technique, it offers unique flexibility, low-cost, and high efficiency and is particularly suitable for open source instrumental development. We overview the major parts of CE instruments, such as high voltage power supplies, detectors, data acquisition systems, and CE software resources with emphasis on availability of the open source information on the web and in the scientific literature. This review is the first of its kind, revealing accessible blueprints of most parts from which a fully functional open source CE system can be built. By collecting the extensive information on open source capillary electrophoresis in this review article, the authors aim at facilitating the dissemination of knowledge on CE within and outside the scientific community, fosters innovation and inspire other researchers to improve the shared CE blueprints. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Open source design of hardware products is an emerging phenomenon that takes more and more importance today's in the society. However, open source (hardware) design implies a tremendous change in both design practices and philosophy because it is partly related to the movements of creative commons and the sharing economy. From this perspective one could think that participation is crucial in the success of open source design projects. In this paper, we analyse 9 case studies in the light of 3 hypotheses. If many studies highlight the potential of the crowd as a resource for design tasks, our study shows that for open source design communities the participation is not massive. In this study, we used an activity-based approach to build our model. As open source design processes are fairly unstructured and based on voluntary participation, it is impossible to adopt a classical task-based model. With the help of this model, we were able evaluate the overall size of the active community, the participation rate with regards to the activities. This study paves the way to deeper and extensive studies on how to support communities engaged in open source design of hardware products. © 2019 Design Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - To be secure, cryptographic algorithms crucially rely on the underlying hardware to avoid inadvertent leakage of secrets through timing side channels. Unfortunately, such timing channels are ubiquitous in modern hardware, due to its labyrinthine fast-paths and optimizations. A promising way to avoid timing vulnerabilities is to devise-and verify-conditions under which a hardware design is free of timing variability, i.e., executes in constant-time. In this paper, we present IODINE: a clock-precise, constant-time approach to eliminating timing side channels in hardware. IODINE succeeds in verifying various open source hardware designs in seconds and with little developer effort. IODINE also discovered two constant-time violations: one in a floating-point unit and another one in an RSA encryption module. © 2019 by The USENIX Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - IoT protocols have been proposed to replace wired systems in aircraft to support telemetry applications. They offer several advantages to wired systems due to them being wireless, low cost, and consuming less power. However, the one consideration that is often overlooked is the security of these wireless protocols. This project focused on investigating the use of open source hardware and software frameworks to create a wireless testbed to conduct penetration testing of the ZigBee protocol. To accomplish this task, the open source XBee software library was used to implement the ZigBee Network and Application Layers within the GNU Radio IDE. The XBee hardware module was leveraged for the IEEE 802.15.4 PHY and MAC Layers. © 2019 International Foundation for Telemetering. All rights reserved.

AB  - The seismic refraction method has undoubted value for near-surface characterisation but its use is generally quite limited. This is often ascribed to the cost of purchasing the required equipment, often exceeding $20,000. In this paper we describe an alternate, low-cost, method for acquiring seismic refraction data. It involves the use of cheap, widely-available, open-source hardware with a total cost of less than $150, coupled with a simple, though innovative, processing method. As well as the cost of the equipment the new system also allows data to be acquired more quickly (8 minutes vs. 30 minutes for a conventional system). Although the data acquired is lower quality, due to the higher noise level, it is still sufficient for shallow applications and can be improved by stacking. © 2018 SEG.

AB  - A new finite-time control method based on a sliding mode for a multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is developed to improve both the transient and steady-state responses, including overshoot and steady-state error in the presence of uncertainties and external disturbances. First, a virtual control with nonlinear sliding manifolds is designed to achieve position-tracking capability, as well as to guarantee the fast convergence of the UAV to a desired position. Furthermore, an ultimate control is developed for the desired attitude-tracking performance. Various uncertainties, including torque due to the discordance between the centre of mass and rotation and wind disturbances are considered. The Lyapunov stability theorem is then applied step-by-step to prove the asymptotically stable and finite-time convergence in position and attitude controllers. Second, the proposed controller is implemented in an open-source hardware platform for a quadrotor UAV. Both numerical and experimental results are compared to validate the tracking performance for attitude and position control, as well as robustness under disturbances. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Recent developments in sensing and monitoring technology allow the application of various sensors and sensor networks for tunnel maintenance. Most maintenance monitoring techniques focus on measuring physical parameters of and within the tunnel structure it-self, with less emphasis placed on the ground conditions surrounding the tunnel structure. Soft soil, weak soil or grouted soil zones are particularly susceptible to long-term changes in ground condition and thus, extensive monitoring is essential to ensure long term tunnel stability and accurate numerical analysis. This study proposes a ground monitoring sensor system for tunnel maintenance using geophysical techniques. The proposed system uses seismic wave velocity and electrical resistivity techniques to estimate the changes in the geomechanical properties of the ground. A low cost prototype sensor was created using open source hardware and software and preliminary tests were conducted on an open area test site. The results show that the system can adequately perform seismic and electrical resistivity tests for tunnel maintenance purposes. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, London.

AB  - Due to their interdisciplinary nature, devices for controlled-environment agriculture have the possibility to turn into ideal tools not only to conduct research on plant phenology but also to create curricula in a wide range of disciplines. Controlled-environment devices are increasing their functionalities as well as improving their accessibility. Traditionally, building one of these devices from scratch implies knowledge in fields such as mechanical engineering, digital electronics, programming, and energy management. However, the requirements of an effective controlled-environment device for personal use brings new constraints and challenges. This paper presents the OpenAg™ Personal Food Computer (PFC); a low cost desktop size platform, which not only targets plant phenology researchers but also hobbyists, makers, and teachers from elementary to high-school levels (K-12). The PFC is completely open-source and it is intended to become a tool that can be used for collective data sharing and plant growth analysis. Thanks to its modular design, the PFC can be used in a large spectrum of activities. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - Access control systems provide a security application for controlling access of persons through controlled gates. The gate, such as a door, can have a lock mechanism for securing the area from unauthorized access. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) / Near Field Communication (NFC) is a key technology for sensor communication enabling a ubiquitous and pervasive computing network, popularly employed in access control systems. In this paper we investigate a case study about the migration of an old chip card based access control system to this new way of authorizing people, based on NFC tags. To this aim, we propose a Model Driven approach that supports (semi) automatic code generation for enabling the communication between an IoT infrastructure and platforms for Facility Access Management. Specifically, the approach combines the benefits of NFC and Tinkerforge (i.e., an open source hardware platform) technologies with model driven techniques. As a consequence, it allows the reduction of the implementation efforts, by also providing snippets as exemplary code usage, while making the whole development process less error-prone and time consuming.

AB  - The purpose of this document is to evaluate the implementation of technology to the hydroponics technique. Knowing that classical cultivation requires the permanent care of the human being for the irrigation of water and tender of the nutritive solution, it is proposed to use technology to replace the basic functions of crop irrigation through the use of programmable and reprogrammable microcontrollers, thus following the free hardware culture, this paper evaluates a scalable system with sensors, an open source hardware and software platform to interact between analog and digital signals. Within the steps that comprehend the realization of the project, the methodology based on components, provides the appropriate guidance for the analysis and choice of hardware, thus allowing the integration of the electronic components to work along with the appropriate coding; as a result the project will collect the pH value present in the nutrient solution, if the value is not adequate, it will automatically activate the insertion of the solution to the container reservoir, to subsequently operate the automated water irrigation for hydroponic farming. Another relevant aspect is that the project can be improved with other devices that will allow an even greater control of variables and data of hydroponics crops. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Modern innovative concepts around Digital Information and Communication Technologies (DICTs), like Industry 4.0, the Internet of Things or Smart Grids, are impacting the scientific and technological worlds and, hence, in control and automation arenas. These trends involve networked interconnection and continuous data flow between a number of hardware and software actors. In parallel, open source technology has gained increasing attention from last years, especially due to the widespread presence of the open source hardware Arduino microcontroller. Focusing on industrial advanced frameworks, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are required to exchange data with new smart devices, sensors and/or actuators. Arduino boards are commonly used as development platforms for such smart devices. Therefore, communication solutions must be designed towards the convergence of open source hardware and widely used traditional SCADA-devoted software. This paper presents a system that seamlessly integrates Arduino boards into a LabVIEW-based SCADA system through Ethernet connection. The open connectivity provided by the Open Platform Communications (OPC) protocol enables such integration. The proposed framework is a novelty in scientific literature. The development of the system is reported and initial results are provided to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposal. Copyright © 2019 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

AB  - An automated method based on open-source hardware was created for the separation of porphyrins fractions from crude oil, an essential step for the quantification of V and Ni as metalloporphyrins. Preparative liquid chromatography was implemented with a reverse phase gradient from MeOH to toluene. The system allows three solvents and fractions changes by using quaternary valves connected to an Arduino microcontroller, programmed on the basis of the absorbance signal measured and its first derivative. Additionally, the method was applied to crude oils (Venezuelan National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 8505 and from a marine reservoir). V and Ni were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and the V-porphyrin profile was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-ICP-MS. The concentrations of the metals grow in the last eluting toluene fractions, associated with asphaltenes. On the other hand, V-porphyrins in the first eluting MeOH fractions showed profiles of labile compounds, with a higher percentage in the Brazilian crude oil (4.9 mg L-1, corresponding to 18% of total V), in comparison to the one from the biodegraded NIST 8505 (59 mg L-1, corresponding to 7% of total V). The overall methodology has a good reproducibility and provides information on elements concentrations associated with porphyrin class compounds. © 2019 Sociedade Brasileira de Química.

AB  - This paper presents an overview on the development and use of open hardware devices in archaeology and their operation in extreme conditions. State-of-the-art technologies are analysed, based on the working experience of the Arc-Team company, which, in 2006, started up a new branch of research, informally called Archeorobotics. The research was initially focused on open hardware radio-controlled UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle); over time different devices were developed, like ROV (Remotely Operated underwater Vehicle), USV (Unmanned Surface Vehicle), CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machine and other electronic and mechanical tools. © 2019 Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche.

AB  - Hearing loss is one of the most common conditions affecting older adults worldwide. Frequent complaints from the users of modern hearing aids include poor speech intelligibility in noisy environments and high cost, among other issues. However, the signal processing and audiological research needed to address these problems has long been hampered by proprietary development systems, underpowered embedded processors, and the difficulty of performing tests in real-world acoustical environments. To facilitate existing research in hearing healthcare and enable new investigations beyond what is currently possible, we have developed a modern, open-source hearing research platform, Open Speech Platform (OSP). This paper presents the system design of the complete OSP wearable platform, from hardware through firmware and software to user applications. The platform provides a complete suite of basic and advanced hearing aid features which can be adapted by researchers. It serves web apps directly from a hotspot on the wearable hardware, enabling users and researchers to control the system in real time. In addition, it can simultaneously acquire high-quality electroencephalography (EEG) or other electrophysiological signals closely synchronized to the audio. All of these features are provided in a wearable form factor with enough battery life for hours of operation in the field. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - This paper proposes open-source hardware Posit Arithmetic Core Generator (PACoGen) for the recently developed universal number posit number system, along with a set of pipelined architectures. The posit number system composed of a run-time varying exponent component, which is defined by a composition of varying length 'regime-bit' and 'exponent-bit' (with a maximum size of ES bits, the exponent size). This in effect also makes the fraction part to vary at run-time in size and position. These run-time variations inherit an interesting hardware design challenge for posit arithmetic architectures. The posit number system, being at an infant stage of its development, possess very limited hardware solutions for its arithmetic architectures. In this view, this paper targets the algorithmic development and generic HDL generators (PACoGen) for basic posit arithmetic. The proposed open source PACoGen currently includes the adder/subtractor, multiplier, and division arithmetic. The PACoGen can provide the Verilog HDL code respective posit arithmetic for any given posit word width (N) and exponent size (ES), as defined under the posit number system. Further, pipelined architectures of 32-bit posit with 6-bit exponent size are also proposed and discussed for addition/subtraction, multiplication, and division arithmetic. The proposed posit arithmetic architectures are demonstrated on the Virtex-7 (xc7vx330t-3ffg1157) FPGA device as well as Nangate 15 nm ASIC platform. The PACoGen would open a gateway for further posit arithmetic hardware exploration and evaluation. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Some people with severe disabilities are confined in a state in which communication is virtually impossible, being reduced to communicating with their eyes or using sophisticated systems that translate thoughts into words. The EyeTrackers and Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are suitable systems for those people but their main drawback is their cost. More affordable devices are capable of detecting voluntary blinks and translating them into a binary signal that allows the selection, for example, of an ideogram on a communication board. We tested four different systems based on infrared, bioelectrical signals (Electro-Oculography (EOG) and Electro-Encephalography (EEG)), and video processing. The experiments were performed by people with/without disabilities and analyzed the systems' performances, usability, and method of voluntary blinking (long blinks or sequence of two short blinks). The best accuracy (99.3%) was obtained using Infrared-Oculography (IR-OG) and the worst with the EEG headset (85.9%) and there was a statistical influence of the technology on accuracy. Regarding the method of voluntary blinking, the use of long or double blinks had no statistical influence on accuracy, excluding EOG, and the time taken to perform double blinks was shorter, resulting in a potentially much faster interface. People with disabilities obtained similar values but with greater variability. The preferred technology and blinking methods were Video-Oculography (VOG) and long blinks, respectively. The several Open-Source Hardware (OSHW) devices have been developed and a new algorithm for detecting voluntary blinks has also been proposed, which outperforms most of the published papers in the reviewed literature. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Open Design is an emerging area of research that seeks to connect and extend the culture of making, social innovation, open-source software, and open-source hardware. A cornerstone for Open Design is to broaden participation in technology innovation by allowing people to use and contribute to publicly shared resources. Makerspaces are important access points to share and contribute to these resources. However, prior to entering the physical door of a makerspace, makerspaces’ social media presence serve as the ‘front door’ for Open Design activities. In this paper, we examine different ‘front doors’ of Open Design, asking: What are the characteristics that produce makerspaces’ social media presences, and how do these representations shape potential access to Open Design activities? We manually collected and qualitatively analyzed 500 public posts on the Facebook sites of five makerspaces in Copenhagen, Denmark. By choosing the same geographical area, we were able to explore the characteristics of makerspaces’ social media presences for the same potential population of Open Design participants. Our analysis identifies three main characteristics of makerspaces’ social media presence, which together shape access to Open Design activities, namely reach, transparency, and discourse. The display of these characteristics produce openness and availability in unique ways, and is constitutive for how Open Design activities are produced online. In this paper, we do not argue for or against specific social media representations. Instead, we argue that the specificities and differences between makerspaces’ social media presences in the same geographical region have the strength of producing different identities across spaces, allowing for a broader definition and potential participation in Open Design. © 2019, Copyright © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In Colombia, sugarcane is one of the most important crops with about 235,000 hectares cultivated at the end of 2017. Therefore, establishing and implementing research projects pursuing objectives as the design of agricultural production procedures which allow more productivity, cleanness, and efficient processes are welcome. We present a wireless sensor network proposal oriented to deal with the lack of monitoring in some agronomic/climatic variables. The prototype is intended to measure variables such as temperature and soil/air moisture. Also measured are soil pH and the most relevant greenhouse gases, i.e., carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. We focused our work in measuring the greenhouse gases to analyze the values in parts per million, seeking to establish a reference point to potentially calculate the carbon footprint associated to the sugarcane cultivation. The closed-chamber technique was used for the measurements and the initial results showed that the gases concentrations were higher outside the chamber: 376Â ppm of CO2, 1.31Â ppm of CH4, and 0.504Â ppm of N2O (outside) compared with the values inside them: 291Â ppm of CO2, 1.01Â ppm of CH4, and 0.163Â ppm of N2O (inside) as average values. Nevertheless, bias was observed during the measurements due to the high current demand the gas sensors needed. We expect to solve these issues and increase the amount of measurements for upcoming releases of the presented prototype. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Optogenetic systems enable unmatched precision for controlling molecular biological processes but require the use of specialized electrical and optical hardware. In an effort to make working with optogenetic systems more accessible, we recently described an open-source hardware platform called the Light Plate Apparatus (LPA). The LPA is a device capable of delivering two independent light signals from standard LEDs to wells of a 24-well culture plate. Basic to advanced level light programs can be created for the LPA in Iris, an easy to use, open-source web application. In this chapter, we describe each step required to build, program, and use the LPA. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Modern computer systems are becoming faster, more efficient, and increasingly interconnected with each generation. Thus, these platforms grow more complex, with new features continually introducing the possibility of new bugs. Although the semiconductor industry employs a combination of different verification techniques to ensure the security of System-on-Chip (SoC) designs, a growing number of increasingly sophisticated attacks are starting to leverage cross-layer bugs. These attacks leverage subtle interactions between hardware and software, as recently demonstrated through a series of real-world exploits that affected all major hardware vendors. In this paper, we take a deep dive into microarchitectural security from a hardware designer's perspective by reviewing state-of-the-art approaches used to detect hardware vulnerabilities at design time. We show that a protection gap currently exists, leaving chip designs vulnerable to software-based attacks that can exploit these hardware vulnerabilities. Inspired by real-world vulnerabilities and insights from our industry collaborator (a leading chip manufacturer), we construct the first representative testbed of real-world software-exploitable RTL bugs based on RISC-V SoCs. Patching these bugs may not always be possible and can potentially result in a product recall. Based on our testbed, we conduct two extensive case studies to analyze the effectiveness of state-of-the-art security verification approaches and identify specific classes of vulnerabilities, which we call HardFails, which these approaches fail to detect. Through our work, we focus the spotlight on specific limitations of these approaches to propel future research in these directions. We envision our RISC-V testbed of RTL bugs providing a rich exploratory ground for future research in hardware security verification and contributing to the open-source hardware landscape. © 2019 by The USENIX Association.

AB  - Microplate (i.e. microwell plate) is a flat plate that has a specific number of wells to be used as small test tubes in cell-culture studies. In most of the low-budget mammalian cell study laboratories, highly skilled laboratory personnel should determine microscopic changes in microplate well media by taking the microplate outside the incubator and by imaging each well medium under a microscope, with the risk of contamination and reliability degrading. An alternative solution is to use an in-incubator operated live-cell imaging device, which, however, cannot be afforded by low-cost laboratories. In this paper, we present the design, realization, and test stages of a microplate compatible inverted bright-field microscope system that can be used in incubators. The developed system enables real-time and long-term in-incubator imaging of any user-selectable microplate type. The device can capture bright-field microscopic images by using a low-cost CMOS image sensor, an inverted varifocal CCTV lens and an array of light emitting diodes. In addition, by developed two-axial movement stage and image augmenting algorithms, the whole area of a user selectable well (e.g. area of a 6.5 mm diameter well in a 96-well plate) can be automatically imaged without using any other third party software. The long-term performance of the system is tested in incubators with human embryonic kidney and breast cancer cell lines. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Vector similarity searching consists of comparing a query vector against a high volume of entries in a reference data set, according to a chosen similarity metric such as the L1-norm, L2-norm, or Hamming distance. Large-scale research and commercial applications of these computations are developing rapidly across artificial intelligence fields as diverse as semantic text querying, retrieval of multimedia materials, and prediction of the properties of pharmacological molecules and engineered materials. While vector similarity searching is, at present, predominantly implemented on standard central processing unit (CPU) hardware running optimized indexing algorithms, the interest in massively-parallel computing architectures is increasing. Accordingly, a range of systems based on graphics processing units (GPU) and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) have been proposed; however, the availability of the design materials for these systems remains largely confined to a small number of corporations and research institutions. Here, we introduce a fully open-source hardware accelerator for vector similarity searching, based on an array of 21 FPGAs densely intertwined with 42 GB of high-speed dynamic memory and installed on a custom-designed compute node board, which yields an aggregate bandwidth of 33.6 GB/s and can be seamlessly reconfigured to implement nearly arbitrary distance calculations. A novel logic and software architecture, based on a lane-wise organization of independent engines implementing distributed distance calculation and sorting, allows attaining noteworthy query latency and power consumption performance on both single- and multi-node system configurations. The entire circuit board hardware, FPGA logic, and host software design is herein presented and freely provided for unlimited use, supporting open innovation and research in this area. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper, an alternative to the traditional methodology related to signal processing-like subjects is proposed. These are subjects that require a deep mathematical and theoretical basis, but the practical goal is not often emphasized, which drives students to lose interest in the subject. Thus, a software-defined radio environment is proposed to provide a more practical view of the subject. This solution consists of an open hardware–software platform able to capture and process a wide range of frequencies. HackRF is the hardware component, while GNU Radio will provide the graphical support to this device. The tests performed with a set of 36 students have revealed that they are more satisfied with this framework than just employing a traditional equation-based environment as Matlab. Furthermore, their scores in the exams also support the suitability of the proposed platform. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - In power generation systems the synchronization of an alternator with the electrical network are an important and critical task. This paper presents the design and building of an automatic three-phase alternator synchronizer based on a low-cost open-hardware Arduino platform. The synchronization is performed by means of measuring a phase voltage of both the synchronous generator and the electrical grid; then the measured voltages are conditioned and sent to the Arduino board, which is programmed to determine the correct moment to connect the alternator to the grid. To validate the prototype, a laboratory setup has been built with the alternator driven by a commercial dc drive. The design and practical implementation of the system is proposed as a project-based learning (PBL) activity for undergraduate final year students at the University of Bío-Bío, Chile. A description of the constructed prototype and the results obtained are presented and discussed. © 2019 Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this article, we present the design and construction of an open hardware-software system responsible for the characterization of the user context, through physiological signals such as: heart rate variability (HRV), galvanic skin response (GSR) and electromyographic signals (EMG), which allows to establish significant levels of mental stress (SI), arousal and valence, metrics important that make possible the inference of emotional states in the person. In addition, we describe the development of computational method for the inference of emotions and the mathematical calculations that involve this process. Finally, the hardware software system validation is presented through a video on demand service based on emotions, which includes a recommendation system that suggests a set of contents based on the user’s emotional behavior during the interaction with the service. This system aims to serve as a reference for the construction of other services based on the study of the user’s emotional behavior in different application contexts. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Two main approaches are currently prevalent in the digital emulation of musical instruments: manipulation of pre-recorded samples and techniques of real-time synthesis, generally based on physical models with varying degrees of accuracy. Concerning the first, while the processing power of present-day computers enables their use in real-time, many restrictions arising from this sample-based design persist; the huge on disk space requirements and the stiffness of musical articulations being the most prominent. On the other side of the spectrum, pure synthesis approaches, while offering greater flexibility, fail to capture and reproduce certain nuances central to the verisimilitude of the generated sound, offering a dry, synthetic output, at a high computational cost. We propose a method where ensembles of lightweight neural networks working in parallel are learned, from crafted frequency-domain features of an instrument sound spectra, an arbitrary instrument’s voice and articulations realistically and efficiently. We find that our method, while retaining perceptual sound quality on par with sampled approaches, exhibits 1/10 of latency times of industry standard real-time synthesis algorithms, and 1/100 of the disk space requirements of industry standard sample-based digital musical instruments. This method can, therefore, serve as a basis for more efficient implementations in dedicated devices, such as keyboards and electronic drumkits and in general purpose platforms, like desktops and tablets or open-source hardware like Arduino and Raspberry Pi. From a conceptual point of view, this work highlights the advantages of a closer integration of machine learning with other subjects, especially in the endeavor of new product development. Exploiting the synergy between neural networks, digital signal processing techniques and physical modelling, we illustrate the proposed method via the implementation of two virtual instruments: a conventional grand piano and a hibrid stringed instrument. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - As conventional fluorescence microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy generally produce images with blurring at the upper and lower planes along the z-axis due to non-focal plane image information, the observation of biological images requires “deconvolution.” Therefore, a microscope system's individual blur function (point spread function) is determined theoretically or by actual measurement of microbeads and processed mathematically to reduce noise and eliminate blurring as much as possible. Here the author describes the use of open-source software and open hardware design to build a deconvolution microscope at low cost, using readily available software and hardware. The advantage of this method is its cost-effectiveness and ability to construct a microscope system using commercially available optical components and open-source software. Although this system does not utilize expensive equipment, such as confocal and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopes, decent images can be obtained even without previous experience in electronics and optics. © 2019 by the author.

AB  - Technological advances have impacted in recent years most of the economic sectors of the world, where they have managed to increase efficiency and profitability particularly with one of the fastest growing applications in this sector: the Internet of Things (IoT). Agriculture is not the exception. However, most farmers in Mexico still use traditional methods of control and monitoring, which prove to be inefficient, causing time and cost losses in today’s globalized world. The present design is an intelligent irrigation system, implemented under IoT principles and free hardware and software. There are soil moisture, luminosity, humidity and temperature sensors in the environment connected to a Raspberry Pi module; sensors detect values in real time while the Raspberry sends the data to be stored in the cloud. The control system is based on fuzzy logic rules that allow turning on and off a water pump. This design includes a mobile app where the system status is monitored. Tests show an appropriate behavior of the irrigation system. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Recent advances in smartphones and affordable open-source hardware platforms have enabled the development of low-cost architectures for Internet-of-Things (IoT)-enabled home automation and security systems. These systems usually consist of sensing and actuating layer that is made up of sensors such as passive infrared sensors, also known as motion sensors; temperature sensors; smoke sensors, and web cameras for security surveillance. These sensors, smart electrical appliances, and other IoT devices connect to the Internet through a home gateway. This paper lays out an architecture for a cost-effective smart door sensor that will inform a user through an Android application, of door open events in a house or office environment. The proposed architecture uses an Arduino-compatible Elegoo Mega 2560 microcontroller board along with the Raspberry Pi 2 board for communicating with a web server that implements a RESTful API. Several programming languages are used in the implementation and further applications of the door sensor are discussed as well as some of its shortcomings such as possible interference from other radio frequency devices. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - The search for Cosmic-Ray Ensembles (CRE), groups of correlated cosmic rays that might be distributed over very large areas, even of the size of the planet, requires a globally spread and dense network of detectors, as proposed by the Cosmic-Ray Extremely Distributed Observatory (CREDO) Collaboration. This proposal motivates an effort towards exploring the potential of using even very much diversified detection technologies within one system, with detection units located even in hard-to-reach places, where, nevertheless, the sensors could work independently - without human intervention. For these reasons we have developed a dedicated communication solution enabling the connection of many different types of detectors, in a range of environments. The proposed data transmission system uses radio waves as an information carrier on the 169MHz frequency band in a contrast to the typical commercially used frequencies in a IoT systems (868MHz). The connectivity within the system is based on the star topology, which ensures the least energy consumption. The solution is now being prepared to being implemented using the prototype detection system based on the CosmicWatch open hardware design: a portable, pocket size, and economy particle detector using the scintillation technique. Our prototype detector is equipped with a dedicated software that integrates it with the already operational CREDO server system. © Copyright owned by the author(s) under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).

AB  - In this paper, we deal with the development of a high speed monitoring system using opensource hardware and MATLAB/Simulink. We use the Arduino Due as opensource hardware. The proposed high speed monitoring system has four features. First, it does not affect the operation of the user application running on a micro-controller. The proposed system performs realtime monitoring using an algorithm that minimizes the computational load. Second, data channels can have different data types and update periods. Consequently, flexible data monitoring is possible. Third, the proposed system uses MATLAB/Simulink for monitoring. As a result, users can utilize all the powerful functions supported by MATLAB to process the monitored data. Finally, the algorithm of the proposed high speed monitoring system can be applied to any micro-controller with serial communication peripheral. Through experiments, we verify the performance of the developed monitoring system. It is shown that the data loss does not happen through the basic experiment. Through realtime monitoring experiment for the sensorless drive system of the BLDC motor, it is illustrated that the proposed system has its strength in high speed monitoring of data changing very fast such as current or back EMF signals. © ICROS 2019.

AB  - Recent advances in smartphones and affordable open-source hardware platforms have enabled the development of low-cost architectures for IoT-enabled home automation and security systems. These systems usually consist of a sensing and actuating layer that is made up of sensors such as PIR (Passive Infra-red) sensors, also known as motion sensors; temperature sensors; smoke sensors, and web cameras for security surveillance. These sensors, smart electrical appliances and other IoT devices connect to the Internet through a home gateway. This paper lays out architecture for a cost effective “smart” door sensor that will inform a user through an Android application, of door open events in a house or office environment. The proposed architecture uses an Arduino-compatible Elegoo Mega 2560 microcontroller (MCU) board along with the Raspberry Pi 2 board for communicating with a web server that implements a RESTful API. Several programming languages are used in the implementation and further applications of the door sensor are discussed as well as some of its shortcomings such as possible interference from other RF (Radio Frequency) devices. © 2019, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.

AB  - In order to improve the level of automation and informatization in greenhouse flower planting, a ZigBee communication technology based greenhouse flower monitoring system was developed. Traditional ZigBee wireless nodes are mostly developed by CC2530, which makes the development of protocol stack difficult and takes a long period. This article selects Arduino open source hardware and XBee module with built-in protocol stack to design the monitoring system. The temperature and umidity sensor, light sensor, CO2 concentration sensor and soil moisture sensor were selected. Arduino Uno R3 was used to collect and process the environmental parameters monitored by the sensor. ZigBee wireless nodes were used to build a short distance wireless star network for data uploading. The upper computer adopts virtual instrument technology and LabVIEW development environment to develop the upper computer monitoring software of greenhouse flower monitoring system. The software platform has beautiful interface, convenient operation, efficient and accurate collection, processing of experimental data. This greenhouse flower monitoring system has advantages of short development cycle, low cost, easy to monitor for a long time and high cost performance. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2019.

AB  - Despite the fact that the open-source community around the RISC-V instruction set archi- tecture is growing rapidly, there is still no high-speed open-source hardware implementation of the IEEE 754-2008 oating-point standard available. We designed a Fused Multiply-Add Floating- Point Unit compatible with the RISC-V ISA in SystemVerilog, which enables us to conduct de- tailed optimizations where necessary. The design has been verified with the industry standard simulation-based Universal Verification Methodology using the Specman e Hardware Verification Language. The most challenging part of the verification is the reference model, for which we in- tegrated the Floating-Point Unit of an existing Intel processor using the Function Level Interface provided by Specman e. With the use of Intel's Floating-Point Unit we have a "known good" and fast reference model. The Back-End ow was done with Global Foundries' 22 nm Fully-Depleted Silicon-On-Insulator (GF22FDX) process using Cadence tools. We reached 1.8 GHz over PVT corners with a 0.8 V forward body bias, but there is still a large potential for further RTL opti- mization. A power analysis was conducted with stimuli generated by the verification environment and resulted in 212 mW. © The Authors 2019.

AB  - The visualization toolkit (VTK) is a popular cross-platform, open source toolkit for scientific and medical data visualization, processing, and analysis. It supports a wide variety of data formats, algorithms, and rendering techniques for both polygonal and volumetric data. In particular, VTK's volume rendering module has long provided a comprehensive set of features such as plane clipping, color and opacity transfer functions, lighting, and other controls needed for visualization. However, due to VTK's legacy OpenGL backend and its reliance on a deprecated API, the system did not take advantage of the latest improvements in graphics hardware or the flexibility of a programmable pipeline. Additionally, this dependence on an antiquated pipeline posed restrictions when running on emerging computing platforms, thereby limiting its overall applicability. In response to these shortcomings, the VTK community developed a new and improved volume rendering module, which not only provides a modern graphics processing unit-based implementation, but also augments its capabilities with new features such as fast volume clipping, gradient-magnitude-based opacity modulation, render to texture, and hardware-based volume picking. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - With the development of technologies such as the Internet of Things and Big Data, agriculture is entering the digital age. Modern information technology and intelligent equipment are the development direction of agriculture. In this paper, a remote-control system for greenhouse environment was developed based on Raspberry Pi, MySQL and Android. The system consists of a greenhouse control system (subsystem A), an environment monitoring system (subsystem B), a MySQL remote database (subsystem C), and an Android monitoring software (subsystem D). The subsystem A is used to implement automatic fertigation and collect data from subsystem B, which will be uploaded to cloud server database (subsystem C). The subsystem B is used to monitor the environmental parameters in the greenhouse such as air temperature/humidity, soil temperature/humidity etc. The subsystem C is used for storage of greenhouse environment data and communication between subsystem B and subsystem D. The subsystem D is used for data visualization including real-Time display, storage and analysis of greenhouse environmental data, and remote control of fertigation system including the EC/pH control of the fertigation solution, irrigation scheduling, and fertigation settings. A proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control algorithm is used for the fertigation process of the subsystem A. The low-power LoRa technology is used for subsystem B to achieve low-power long-distance data transmission, which is especially suitable to greenhouses. All monitoring settings can be operated remotely by users. © 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper aims to design a stable, reliable, energy-efficient yet low-cost structural health monitoring (SHM) system for bridges in remote regions. First, the integrated system design was adopted based on the Linux architecture, and the power-efficient opensource hardware was taken as the mini Linux PCs on the bridge site. Next, several sensor subsystems were integrated physically via the Ethernet, while nine core software modules were developed based on opensource software and integrated into a logical whole. The stability of the system was improved through dual PC redundancy and intelligent fault diagnosis. The data collected by sensors were analyzed in real time and only the valid data and alarms were transmitted to the remote monitoring center. In addition, the remote transmission and active control were completed, with the aid of 3G/4G router, VPN and reverse SSH tunneling. In this way, the author developed an easy-to-maintain and cost-efficient SHM system. Finally, the effectiveness of the system was verified through the application in a bridge on an expressway in Yunnan Province, China. The results fully demonstrate the robustness, accuracy and cost effectiveness of the proposed system. This research fills up the gap in Linux-based SHM system design for bridges in remote regions, providing a reliable and advanced reference for the construction of bridge SHM systems. © 2019 Lavoisier.

AB  - We report that a large field of view (FOV) retinal image can be acquired by a low-cost smart fundus camera. This handheld system includes a Raspberry Pi board, a touch screen display, a customized optical lens group, a ring LED light, and a Li-battery. Based on the open hardware platform and Linux operating system, we have integrated the portable system with component switching and image processing functions. Wide FOV has been realized using image stitching and structure from motion algorithms. This customized low-cost handheld fundus camera provides better image quality than cellphone-based fundus imaging solutions and offers more operational features than traditional portable fundus cameras. It may benefit field portable ophthalmic diagnostic applications. © COPYRIGHT SPIE. Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a power management framework for solar-powered Internet of Things (IoT) devices to maximize the lifetime of the system by adaptively changing performance of the system. Our framework balances the energy consumption and the performance of the IoT system by monitoring energy accumulation and battery, and ensures the minimum level of service. The framework has been implemented in real hardware and software. Experiments with the implemented system shows that our framework can help increase the lifetime of the solar powered IoT system. The framework prevented the IoT device from power down due to the full discharge of the battery at night time, by changing the execution rate based on energy accumulation and battery status. The proposed framework has been implemented using open hardware compatible with Arduino, so it can be used for a wide range of IoT applications and services. © 2018, Engineering and Technology Publishing.

AB  - This paper describes the factors and body of knowledge used to develop an engineering application kit designed for both conceptual learning and application in displaced and marginalized communities, the EngStarter. The specific contribution of this study is the description of an effective engineering education response in emergencies, demonstrating the potential of enabling community development and effective usage of technologies in the delivery of course content. This kit emerged as a result of two years designing and conducting an undergraduate introductory engineering course in the Azraq and Kakuma refugee camps where the research team listened to students' needs and evaluated contextual opportunities and constraints. In this paper, we describe a work-in-progress study of the development and application of an education kit that complements the coursework and enables students' engineering prototypes to be built and implemented in the community.

AB  - Swarm robotics is a relatively new research field that employs multiple robots (tens, hundreds or even thousands) that collaborate on complex tasks. There are several issues which limit the real-world application of swarm robotic scenarios, e.g. autonomy time, communication methods, and cost of commercialised robots. We present a platform, which aims to overcome the aforementioned limitations while using off-the-shelf components and freely-available software. The platform combines (i) a versatile open-hardware micro-robot capable of local and global communication, (ii) commercially-available wireless charging modules which provide virtually unlimited robot operation time, (iii) open-source marker-based robot tracking system for automated experiment evaluation, (iv) and a LCD display or a light projector to simulate environmental cues and pheromone communication. To demonstrate the versatility of the system, we present several scenarios, where our system was used. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Traffic management and car parking on modern cities continues to be a problem both for citizens and for city officials. The increasing number of vehicles flowing into the city drain the existing scarce parking resources, and the increase in time spent looking for a parking spot leads to more congestions, parasitic traffic, whilst augmenting fuel consumption and air pollution. In this paper we present an integrated flexible solution developed to help address this issue, using open hardware and software components to develop a low-cost smart parking system suitable for contemporary metropolitan cities. The smart parking solution is based on Arduino boards for the sensors network and on Raspberry Pi single-board computers for the gateway devices, integrated through specific developed software components and a mobile application for the end-users. © 2019, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.

AB  - Mass Individualisation is a new product design paradigm that comprises an open-hardware platform and multiple independent modules for end-user’s selection that are integrated with the platform. Open platform architecture products (OPAP) are the key enablers for this paradigm. Based on explorative literature analysis, with practical insights from an industrial questionnaire survey, an Innovation toolkit for the end-user has been developed. This provides a means for selecting an optimal OPAP. The design of the Innovation toolkit has been approached in four different steps: modelling of OPAP Products; modelling of evaluation measures and evaluation indices with end-user preferences; identification of the optimal module options for every configuration and Configuration optimisation. Two case studies have been presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and to illustrate that the Innovation toolkit can readily be applied to these types of product development to obtain highly individualised and optimised OPAP. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2019.

AB  - Cars for disabled drivers consist of adapting their functionalities to be operated by hands, in a manner a paraplegic individual should rely only on their hands. This task can become difficult taking into account that the subject must control all functionalities with the same limb. It can increase the risk of car accident. To reduce this type of distraction, we propose the construction of a prototype to control the functionalities in a car using gestures captured by electromyographic signals. The data is simulated by an Arduino® and, afterwards, sent to a Raspberry Pi®. Then we perform signal classification using an Extreme Learning Machine. The result of the classification will be used to control automotive functionalities. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of real-time car functionalities control using electromyography and efficient low-cost hardware. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - (Figure Presented) Measuring ingestive behavior of liquids in rodents is commonly used in studies of reward, metabolism, and circadian biology. Common approaches for measuring liquid intake in real time include computer-tethered lickometers or video-based systems. Additionally, liquids can be measured or weighed to determine the amount consumed without real-time sensing. Here, we built a photobeam-based sipper device that has the following advantages over traditional methods: (1) it is battery powered and fits in vivarium caging to allow home-cage measurements; (2) it quantifies the intake of two different liquids simultaneously for preference studies; (3) it is low cost and easily constructed, enabling high-throughput experiments; and (4) it is open source so that others can modify it to fit their experimental needs. We validated the performance of this device in three experiments. First, we calibrated our device using time-lapse video-based measurements of liquid intake and correlated sipper interactions with liquid intake. Second, we used the sipper device to measure preference for water versus chocolate milk, demonstrating its utility for two-bottle choice tasks. Third, we integrated the device with fiber photometry, establishing its utility for measuring neural activity in studies of ingestive behavior. This device requires no special equipment or caging, and is small, battery powered, and wireless, allowing it to be placed directly in rodent home cages. The total cost of fabrication is less than $100, and all design files and code are open source. Together, these factors greatly increase scalability and utility for a variety of behavioral neuroscience applications. © 2019 Godynyuk et al.

AB  - The Abbe School of Photonics (ASP) provides photonics education of graduate and doctoral students at the Friedrich Schiller University in Jena, Germany. The main instrument for training students in optical sciences is a Master's degree program, which is open to international students, research-oriented and supported by German photonics industry. In this context, a conceptually new open lab Makerspace for photonics was established to support both the internal students in the realization of innovative and creative processes, as well as to build a strong and curious community of like-minded people from outside of the university. The photonics Makerspace provides all tools and materials needed to setup state-of-the-art optical instruments. Furthermore, it provides technical mentoring, open workshops and lectures. Partners from the photonics industry corroborate the process of making by well-established open innovation schemes and are integrated into the Makerspace with hackathon and innovation camp formats where the Makerspace users work on industry challenges. Finished and ongoing projects are transformed into freely accessible, open source hardware while a commercial exploitation of the projects is supported. Out of the broad topical spectrum of ongoing projects, two quite advanced examples are a low-cost smartphone-based 3D-scanner with a cloud-based, free software and a high-resolution microscope built of 3D-printed modules. For these projects, apart from hardware and software, also workshops and lectures are available. Other examples include a drone for medical applications in search and rescue, a smartphone-based lithography setup, a Raman-spectrometer, a camera array for meteorite detection, and many more. All activities of the Makerspace are scientifically investigated with special attention on the interaction between open innovation approaches and the Maker scene.

AB  - This paper constitutes a contribution in Distance Education field’s (E-Learning), more precisely to the Distance Training by practical activities of the laboratory (E-Lab). Indeed, the majority of distance training platforms offer theoretical courses and a few practical activities which are essential in training theoretical Science and Technology. In this work, we propose a generic and open hardware/software architecture which permits remote access to a laboratory’s equipment. We detail the implementation and the use of two user-friendly graphical interfaces using Internet/Intranet network and TCP/IP communication protocol. These interfaces designed in MATLAB environment, work both in intranet and internet network. It allows to a learner a real-time control and supervision to carry out all the practical activity according to a pedagogical scenario elaborated by the trainer. The functioning of these interfaces is illustrated by educational sessions articulated on the Proportional–Integral–Derivative (PID) regulation and the Generalized Predictive Control (GPC) of the temperature control system. The challenge is to elaborate a remote practical activity taking into the pedagogical effectiveness is accomplished in the proposed solution. The remote training platform equipped by a specific hardware and software, allows to achieve traditional laboratory experimentations. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Current integrated circuits exhibit an impressive and increasing power density. In this scenario, thermal modelling plays a key role in the design of next generation cooling and thermal management solutions. However, extending existing thermal models, or designing new ones to account for new cooling solutions, requires parameter identification as well as a validation phase to ensure correctness of the results. In this paper, we propose a flexible solution to the validation issue, in the form of a hardware platform based on a Thermal Test Chip (TTC). The proposed platform allows to test a heat dissipation solution under realistic conditions, including fast spatial and temporal power gradients as well as hot spots, while collecting a temperature map of the active silicon layer. The combined power/temperature map is the key input to validate a thermal model, in both the steady state and transient case. This paper presents the current development of the platform, and provides a first validation dataset for the case of a commercial heat sink. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - Nowadays, energy consumption and especially energy saving, are topics of great importance. Recent news regarding global warming has increased the need to save energy. In Finland, one of the major sources of energy consumption is housing. Furthermore, the heating of residential buildings accounts for up to 68% of housing energy consumption. Therefore, it is not surprising that apartment energy consumption and ways to save energy in housing are a popular research topic in Finland. In this paper, two different research areas are introduced: First, a literature survey is presented on the research subjects of energy saving in the area of real estate and housing. The goal is to gain overall knowledge of the current state of energy saving research. The overall conclusion is that knowledge of energy consumption improves efforts toward energy saving. Second, rapid prototyping with off-the-shelf devices and open source software are described. These devices are cheap to install, and a wide range of sensors are available. Consequently, it is important to deal with these topics together. The former studies provide knowledge about the usage of open hardware, open software, and open architectures with the development of prototype systems for gathering data. The literature survey gives us new information on the specialties of energy consumption measuring, offering a new area for modeling and developing prototype systems. These experiences will be taken forward and utilized in energy saving and environmentally sustainable solutions, such as Green Computing. © 2019, Budapest Tech Polytechnical Institution.

AB  - This study reports on the results of a systematic literature review on ‘open design’ in academic fields including and beyond design and HCI. The review investigates how studies are framed as open design and open-source design (including ‘open hardware’): how researchers contribute to conceptual theorizing about open design or study its practical operationalization, in do-it-yourself ‘making,’ manufacturing and practices in-between these domains. Most of the papers reviewed were empirical studies from diverse fields. Open design was analyzed not only as contributions and solutions, but also as open-to-participate processes, openly shared processes, and open, closed, and modular (open and closed) outcomes. Various research fields presented an open design framing as an alternative to the status quo: new ways to do business and/or to foster socio-environmental sustainability. On the manufacturing side, open design was sought especially to accelerate innovation cycles; on the making side, it was espoused to foster democratization. However, the studies reviewed indicated that companies do not appear to develop much beyond business-as-usual. From the research perspective, the conceptual potential of open design to promote sustainability saw little practical exploration. Additionally, issues around open design community governance and ownership, safety and reliability of open outcomes require further investigation. © 2019, Copyright © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are a rapidly evolving tool in geosciences and are increasingly deployed for studying the dynamic processes of the earth's surface. To assess the potential of autonomous low-cost UAVs for the mapping and monitoring of alpine glaciers, we conducted multiple aerial surveys on the Kanderfirn in the Swiss Alps in 2017 and 2018 using open hardware and software of the Paparazzi UAV project. The open-source photogrammetry software OpenDroneMap was tested for the generation of high-resolution orthophotos and digital surface models (DSMs) from aerial imagery and cross-checked with the well-established proprietary software Pix4D. Accurately measured ground control points served for the determination of the geometric accuracy of the orthophotos and DSMs. A horizontal (xy) accuracy of 0.7-1.2 m and a vertical (z) accuracy of 0.7-2.1 m was achieved for OpenDroneMap, compared to a xy-accuracy of 0.3-0.5 m and a z-accuracy of 0.4-0.5 m obtained for Pix4D. Based on the analysis and comparison of different orthophotos and DSMs, surface elevation, roughness and brightness changes from 3 June to 29 September 2018 were quantified. While the brightness of the glacier surface decreased linearly over the ablation season, the surface roughness increased. The mean DSM-based elevation change across the glacier tongue was 8 m, overestimating the measured melting and surface lowering at the installed ablation stakes by about 1.5 m. The presented results highlight that self-built fixed-wing UAVs in tandem with open-source photogrammetry software are an affordable alternative to commercial remote-sensing platforms and proprietary software. The applied low-cost approach also provides great potential for other regions and geoscientific disciplines. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - We have attempted to create affordable programmable logical controllers (PLC) that can be used to train millions of students in developing countries. Version 1 of the PLC is based on AtMega16 and costs |600 ($10). Using the free and open source software (FOSS) LD Micro, one can learn ladder logic. To enhance the capabilities, using Raspberry PI, Version 2 of the PLC, costing |1,500 ($25) is made. We can use this device with the FOSS OpenPLC to learn ladder logic. We can also learn function block based programming using the FOSS 4DIAC. As ladder logic and function block based programming are industrial standards, students trained using our approach will be useful to industry. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Long-range (LoRa) radio technologies have recently gained momentum in the IoT landscape, allowing low-power communications over distances up to several kilometers. As a result, more and more LoRa networks are being deployed. However, commercially available LoRa devices are expensive and propriety, creating a barrier to entry and possibly slowing down developments and deployments of novel applications. Using open-source hardware and software platforms would allow more developers to test and build intelligent devices resulting in a better overall development ecosystem, lower barriers to entry, and rapid growth in the number of IoT applications. Toward this goal, this paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of KRATOS, a low-cost LoRa platform running ContikiOS. Both, our hardware and software designs are released as an open-source to the research community. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - A robotic platform is essential to validate any algorithm developed for mobile robotics research, as usually simulation results does not reflect all the real world circumstances and error sources. Nowadays there are several available commercial solutions that can be used to validate the developed algorithms, but they are usually expensive and closed to hardware modifications. Another option is to build the robotic platform, but while these solutions are normally open hardware and can be easily modified and maintained, many are assembled using low cost components and are intended only for robot education, and for this reason are not suitable for advanced algorithm implementation nor can employ advanced sensors. A possible solution is presented in this paper, in which an open hardware modular omnidirectional platform is developed, with robust hardware implementation using modular commercially available components, at a lower cost that some more expensive available solutions, but with similar performance and capabilities being suitable for mobile robot research and experimentation. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - The continuous exposure to high levels of atmospheric pollution can cause harmful effects on the population health and environment. Technology advances in communication networks and air pollution sensors allow the development of low-cost systems for the management of the air quality in cities. The deployment of a large number of sensors provides a better geographic and temporal resolution, and it complements the traditional monitoring networks. In this work, we present an experience in the city of La Plata, Argentina, where an air quality monitoring system for urban areas was assembled. This system is based on a LoRaWAN network, and uses free hardware and software environments. All the sensed information is transmitted to a scalable platform for IoT in the cloud, where we can process the received data, monitor the network state and generate statistics. In this first experience, we test 3 different models of sensors (Nova SDS011, Nova SDS021 y SHINYEI PPD42) in combination with a low volume sampler of particulate matter, MiniVol TAS Airmetrics. The results obtained until the moment provide a contribution to the construction of future Smart Cities. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - An experimental setup capable of stimulating, inhibiting, sensing, processing and analyzing a biological system is presented. The experimental setup is based on open-source, open hardware commercial devices. It can be applied to record and control neuronal activity, for example to establish causal links between neurons and behavior in a closed-loop fashion. Cells or group of cells can be triggered by acoustical, electrical or light impulses. This last case is based on a technique defined as optogenetics. The latter is used in an example that reads and controls neuronal activity of a population of neurons in laboratory rats forcing them to transition between neuronal states, illustrates the system developed in this work. © 2018 Argentine Association of Automatic Control.

AB  - Soft wearable robots comprised of deformable materials have recently attracted much attention in the field of applications for its lightness and elasticity. However, there exist some limitation to the control of wearable robots due to the complexity of the model and the conditions of the wearer. In this paper, we propose a learning-based position control method of soft wearable glove using a deep neural network (DNN). To analyze our proposed method, we fabricated a soft pneumatic glove and a control board for the glove based on open hardware platform data. With our developed system, we collected the pressure and position data of the soft glove using a Leap Motion sensor to train our soft glove position network (SGPN). Along with our proposed DNN model, we could enable open-loop control on the joint positions of the soft glove by supplying pressure to the actuator without prior knowledge of the wearer or the wearable robot such as hand size of the wearer or the stiffness of pneumatic actuator. © ICROS.

AB  - The rise of emerging technologies and the emergence of open and free hardware and software trends have allowed the emergence of new embedded system options such as the Nodemcu card based on the esp8266 microcontroller, among many others, which at very low cost allows implement an On/Off control or domotic control for an environment or location that improves its comfort and energy saving conditions as main objectives. Understanding home automation as the system capable of automating a home or building of any kind, which is capable of providing energy management, security, welfare, maintenance and communication services, and which can be integrated by means of wireless networks or Wi-Fi technology, to give a control that provides certain ubiquity, from inside and outside the place through the use of an application or app, provides a huge opportunity to take advantage of current technology adapted to any type of environment or space. This use could be defined as the integration of technology in the intelligent design of a closed area, including conventional training environments or classrooms, which unlike the rest of other locations or modern properties, do not enjoy the same advances with which they enjoy new establishments of offices, banks and hotels that make our daily activities more pleasant. This research will use the quasi-experimental method since with the collaboration of experts through the network and the state of the art consulted, small experiments or tests have been developed using low-cost technology modules, thus checking the functioning of different connections and configurations, which generates the sending and receiving of data, which allows us to give or not advance to the analysis, programming and revision of the behavior of the occupation of an environment, making the focus towards a short-term future of the research quantitative. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - In general, warehouses are used to store goods or products. In the Warehouses, if the user wants to locate any product it is very difficult, because user have to do a detailed search manually in all the available stockrooms this requires a lot of effort. So to avoid this problem the warehouse inventory management system is very helpful because it maintains the detailed product information and tells us in which stockroom the product is present. The warehouse inventory management system is playing a significant aspect in many productions and goods based methodology. Though there are many wireless communication technologies the RFID suits the best for the warehouse inventory management system. The tag information is transferred from the transmitter section to open source hardware via a wireless link with the aid of internet. The warehouse inventory management system built on the architecture of the Internet of Things is developed to track the products attached to the tags with product information and their respective time stamps for further verification. The Raspberry Pi acts as a central server, monitoring all the information. The total system gives an archetype to correspond the information flow and material flow. The web page which is built in accordance to provide convenient and an interface to the user to track the products. The developed system results a very low cost system and works dynamically compared with the existing present warehouse inventory management systems. © 2018 Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University

AB  - Simple 3-D printable open source hardware designs have proven to be effective scientific instruments at low costs. Further development in this area is coupling open source electronics with 3-D printable mechanical components to make fully functional distributedly-manufactured mechatronic tools for science. One research area where such low-cost technology is needed is to characterize thin film anti-reflective coatings and transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) for the glass, mirror and solar photovoltaic industry whose transmission properties are angle dependent. To meet this research need a low-cost 3-D printable open source dual axis gimbal system is presented in this study. An Arduino based microcontroller is used to move the sample holder to the user specified angle where two stepper motors control the motion providing two degrees of freedom. The sample holder is made in such a way that samples can easily be mounted on it by two movable latches. The system was validated and characterized for: i) unidirectional accuracy, ii) repeatability, iii) backlash, iv) speed resolution and v) microstep size. Finally, the mechatronic system is tested for the intended application using a halogen light source and a spectrometer to measure transmission through glass TCO samples through a hemisphere. The system performed as expected has a unidirectional accuracy of 2.827° repeatability of 1.585° backlash error of 1.237° maximum speed of 35.156° and a verifiable microstep size of 0.33°. Despite the highest mean squared errors, the open source gimbal system performed adequately while measuring transmission of radiation through glass with TCO coatings. This open source system also represents a 96% cost in savings as compared to the least expensive commercial variant. The high mean squared errors are offset by the cost of the system coupled with its open source nature that promotes further collaboration and hence, development. © 2018

AB  - The last decade has witnessed a significant reduction in prices and an increased performance of electronic components, coupled with the influence of the shift towards the generation of open resources, both in terms of knowledge (open access), programs (open-source software), and components (open hardware). This situation has produced different effects in today’s society, among which is the empowerment of citizens, called makers, who are themselves able to generate citizen science or build assembly developments. Situated in the context described above, the current study follows a Do-It-Yourself (DIY) approach. In this way, it attempts to define a conceptual design of an Internet of Things (IoT) node, which is reproducible at both physical and behavioral levels, to build IoT nodes which can cover any scenario. To test this conceptual design, this study proposes a sensorization node to monitor meteorological phenomena. The node is called SEnviro (node) and features different improvements such as: the possibility of remote updates using Over-the-Air (OTA) updates; autonomy, using 3G connectivity, a solar panel, and applied energy strategies to prolong its life; and replicability, because it is made up of open hardware and other elements such as 3D-printed pieces. The node is validated in the field of smart agriculture, with the aim of monitoring different meteorological phenomena, which will be used as input to disease detection models to detect possible diseases within vineyards. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - This article examines how decisions are made and justified within cultures of contribution using an "operational pragmatics." Peer-production and contribution cultures are enfolded in a dynamic of resistance and appropriation in relation to capitalism. Opensource and contribution-based cultural processes have been critiqued as tending towards bureaucracy or becoming enfolded in a never-ending neoliberal imaginary from which escape or transcendence become impossible. An examination of the values expressed within a peer-production community challenges these perspectives and shows how "operational pragmatics" can provide moral justifications through reference to matters of principle and matters of design. Conflating these matters complicates claims about the inherent virtues of participation, especially in technical cultures. A qualitative analysis of an open-source hardware project shows how competing moral justifications unfold, and how the challenges that they pose to capitalism may be tenuous or temporary because of the way that justificatory regimes work within technology development under capitalism. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - It has been identified from literature that affordability is the main constraint faced by the majority of MANET (Mobile Ad-hoc Network) researchers which sees them forgoing implementing real world experimental studies that are costlier, in favour of opting for cheaper simulation tools instead. While simulation tools provide a simple and inexpensive method to gain an understanding of algorithms and protocols in MANET research, its reliability and accuracy in representing real systems and contexts are critically limited. Thus, this paper unveils the ToMRobot, created with low budget using ordinary remote control (RC) car coupled with a few low cost electronic components, to serve as a fully functional MANET testbed. Provided in this paper are practical knowhow to model and produce ToMRobot from scratch specifically targeted to facilitate less technical savvy MANET researchers. Despite being really economical, significantly inexpensive to create, highly customizable with flexible option that allows researchers to upgrade by utilizing components such as Arduino and Cubieboard2 from technologies that can be sourced from open hardware, ToMRobot still maintains all aspects of MANET rudimentary structures. It is hoped that the guidelines contained within this paper will help MANET researchers to build robots that can be used in their future MANET testbeds, which will in turn ultimately increase the number of MANET researchers who choose testbeds as their evaluation tool. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - This work describes the development of a peristaltic pump and a photometric detector, using “Arduino” and alternative and low-cost materials for flow analysis system. The analytical calibration curve of the acid-red-283 using the proposed system presents 0.9984 and 3.9% as the coefficients of determination and variation, and 1.1 and 3.8 mg L-1 as limits of detection and quantification, respectively. Three prepared samples of the acid-red-283 (25, 30 and 35 mg L-1) showed recovery between 99 to 104%. For construction of the peristaltic pump and the photometer using Light Emitting Diodes (LED), light-dependent resistor (LDR) were spent less than 10% of the cost was spent on a commercial system employing a peristaltic pump and a spectrophotometer. Furthermore, the peristaltic pump and the photometer developed in this work allow the implementation of practical disciplines, such as molecular absorption spectrophotometry and flow analysis system in undergraduate courses, making these instruments more accessible, especially for the chemistry students. © 2018 Sociedade Brasileira de Quimica.All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Automation in the agriculture system is essential these days. That is why this subject required special attentiveness. On comprehensive, this problem is solved with the help of satellite-based instruments. In the present case the monitoring system collects the agricultural parameters on a more regional level. This paper attempts to gather the data from various sensors using Wi-Fi technology with IoT, which comprises of Arduino Nano and esp8266-01. The realisation of data gathered by sensors (moisture in the soil, temperature of the soil, light intensity and humidity, status motor pump) based on open source hardware Arduino Nano. Some sensors (TSL2561, DS18B20) will directly provide the data (light intensity, temperature) to the Arduino Nano using I2C and one wire protocol respectively, while other sensors provides the raw data through Arduino Nano's 10-bit analogue to digital converter(ADC). Sensor data processed and communicated to esp8266-01(which act as a Wi-Fi node) incorporating request-send-acknowledgement method.Further esp82666-01 uploads the sensor information on blynk android IoT application and displayed on Graphical User Interface (GUI). The complete system is cost-effective and having low power consumption. IoT is used for update and alert to the farmers through an android application. The notification of irrigation events in the farm site is continuously updated to the farmer. The trials show that the present system works fine, and it is helpful for practical applications to the personalised low-cost agricultural parameter monitoring system. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Several technological solutions are being researched to establish efficient, reliable, and robust wireless vehicular electric charging on a wide scale. We propose an artificial vision system-the Grid Alignment Assistant System (GAAS)- A imed at maximizing the energy flow between the transmitting and receiving goals, by supporting the driver in the task of keeping an alignment between the vehicle and the charging grids in the road. GAAS exploits low cost and open hardware and software components. GAAS supports IoT capabilities as an API cloud service is developed for real-time measurements storage. This paper presents road test results showing that high precision misalignment estimations can be achieved, and presents some challenges imposed by the actual deployment environment. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Physiological (or biosignal) data acquisition and analysis has evolved from being intrinsically bound to medical practice or lab settings, to become a pervasive data source with numerous applications. This has been mostly leveraged by the proliferation of wearables and open hardware platforms. While the first devices offer good cloud connectivity (albeit to proprietary servers) but only provide high-level features, the latter have opposite characteristics, creating a gap in what concerns collaborative access to datasets for reuse in academic research. In this paper we describe a module devised to help bridge this gap, by enabling real-time biosignal streaming directly from an open hardware physiological data acquisition platform to a cloud-based repository over Wi-Fi. Performance tests have been made to assess the data transmission reliability, and the adopted approach to the repository enables user-friendly collaborative access, visualisation and sharing of the recorded data. © EURASIP 2018.

AB  - In this work, the authors propose a low-cost, portable, and comfortable, single-channel Brain Computer Interface, based on Steady-State Visual-Evoked Potential with open source hardware and low computational cost algorithms, for daily use. The system is proved to be capable of overcoming the following state-of-the-art drawbacks: (i) the number of electrodes: a high number of electrodes increases the quality but is less comfortable for the user; (ii) the quality of the signal recorded in the scalp area of interest, typically covered with hair. At this aim, the authors propose: (i) the adoption of a single differential channel acquisition, in this case only three electrodes are used for the recording of the brain signal; (ii) the use of spring loaded pins electrodes in scalp area covered with hair to improve the contact and, as a consequence, the quality of recorded signal. The system as a whole is then tested on a group of people in order to validate its performance in terms of reached accuracy. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Agricultural research involves study of the complex soil–plant–atmosphere–water system, and data relating to this system must be collected under often-harsh outdoor conditions in agricultural environments. Rapid advancements in electronic technologies in the last few decades, as well as more recent widespread proliferation and adoption of electronic sensing and communications, have created many options to address the needs of professional, as well as amateur, researchers. In this study, an agricultural research project was undertaken to collect data and examine the effects of different agronomic practices on yield, with the objectives being to develop a monitoring system to measure soil moisture and temperature conditions in field plots and to upload the data to an internet website. The developed system included sensor nodes consisting of sensors and electronic circuitry to read and transmit sensor data via radio and a cellular gateway to receive node data and forward the data to an internet website via cellular infrastructure. Microcontroller programs were written to control the nodes and gateway, and an internet website was configured to receive and display sensor data. The battery-powered sensor nodes cost $170 each, including electronic circuitry and sensors, and they were operated throughout the cropping season with little maintenance on a single set of batteries. The solar-powered gateway cost $163 to fabricate, plus an additional cost of $2 per month for cellular network access. Wireless and cellular data transmissions were reliable, successfully transferring 95% of sensor data to the internet website. Application of open-source hardware, wireless data transfer, and internet-based data access therefore offers many options and advantages for agricultural sensing and monitoring efforts. © 2018 by the authors

AB  - Current high-performance-thin-layer-chromatography instrumentation is offline and stepwise automated. However, moderate miniaturization offers many advantages and together with the transfer of modern print and media technologies to the field of chromatography (office chromatography) it opens up new avenues. This is demonstrated in an all-in-one open-source system developed for planar chromatography and especially for ultrathin-layer chromatography. Using an InkShield board to control a thermal inkjet cartridge, picoliter drops were printed at a resolution of 96 dpi on the adsorbent layer. Using Marlin, a popular firmware in 3D printing, Cartesian movement of the print head was made possible for full control of the printing process. Open-source software was developed to control the device in each operation step. Sample solutions and mobile phase were inkjet-printed, exemplarily shown for the analysis of dye- or paraben-mixture solutions. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were investigated for documentation. For example, deep UV LEDs gave access to 254 nm light, and RGB LEDs gave access to the visible-light range. Calibration functions with correlation coefficients superior to 0.999 were obtained by videodensitometry. The developed modular open-source hardware was compact (26 × 31 × 26 cm 3 ), light (&lt;3 kg), and affordable (€810). For the given analyses, the footprint of current instrumentation needed was miniaturized by a factor of 9. The highly reduced material design complies with green chemistry and lean laboratory. The design and instruction to reproduce the all-in-one open-source system were made freely available at https://github.com/OfficeChromatography. It is intended to boost progress and understanding by the nature of do it yourself. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Despite a growing consensus that 3D printing technology has emerged as a revolutionary driver of innovation in society and has grown exponentially as an innovation ecosystem, our understanding of how the 3D printing ecosystem emerged and has grown is still limited. Based on the case study and the grounded theory approach, we found that four relevant platforms—open-source hardware platforms, online service platforms, free and low-cost 3D design software platforms, and crowdsourcing platforms—nurtured the innovation ecosystem. We also found that complementary relationships among the four platforms accelerated the growth of the ecosystem from the perspective of an increase in the user base, 3D printer sales, 3D design contents, and the emergence of entrepreneurial firms that are developing the platforms. Consequently, we newly suggest “complementary multiplatforms,” a platform strategy that develops multiple platforms with complementary relationships for nurturing an innovation ecosystem. Our findings provide important theoretical grounds for the multiplatform strategy with complementary relationships aimed at facilitating the growth of an innovation ecosystem. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Arc discharge due to the electron emission is one of the key issues in the CW superconducting RF(SRF) for the CiADS particle accelerator. Arc discharges can deteriorate the SRF cavities and damage the facility. Monitoring arc discharges is important for the purpose of machine protection. In this paper, an arc discharge detector has been designed to provide fast response upon events of arc discharge using open-source hardware and LabVIEW software. Electronic design techniques are described to enhance the system stability while utilizing the flexibility of embedded electronics. The proposed detector system gives about 700 ns of response time and it employs a LabVIEW based graphic user interface. The system has the capability of detecting the instantaneous arc discharge events in real time. Timestamps of the event will be recorded to assist beam diagnostics. This paper describes the hardware/software implementation and concludes with initial results of tests at CiADS. Copyright © 2018 by JACoW — cc Creative Commons Attribution 3.0.

AB  - Purpose: To study the role of temperature in biological systems, diagnostic contrasts and thermal therapies, RF pulses for MR spin excitation can be deliberately used to apply a thermal stimulus. This application requires dedicated transmit/receive (Tx/Rx) switches that support high peak powers for MRI and high average powers for RF heating. To meet this goal, we propose a high-performance Tx/Rx switch based on positive-intrinsic-negative diodes and quarter-wavelength (λ/4) stubs. Methods: The λ/4 stubs in the proposed Tx/Rx switch design route the transmitted RF signal directly to the RF coil/antenna without passing through any electronic components (e.g., positive-intrinsic-negative diodes). Bench measurements, MRI, MR thermometry, and RF heating experiments were performed at f = 297 MHz (B0 = 7 T) to examine the characteristics and applicability of the switch. Results: The proposed design provided an isolation of −35.7dB/−41.5dB during transmission/reception. The insertion loss was −0.41dB/−0.27dB during transmission/reception. The switch supports high peak (3.9 kW) and high average (120 W) RF powers for MRI and RF heating at f = 297 MHz. High-resolution MRI of the wrist yielded image quality competitive with that obtained with a conventional Tx/Rx switch. Radiofrequency heating in phantom monitored by MR thermometry demonstrated the switch applicability for thermal modulation. Upon these findings, thermally activated release of a model drug attached to thermoresponsive polymers was demonstrated. Conclusion: The high-power Tx/Rx switch enables thermal MR applications at 7 T, contributing to the study of the role of temperature in biological systems and diseases. All design files of the switch will be made available open source at www.opensourceimaging.org. © 2018 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine

AB  - Impedance cardiography (ICG) is a noninvasive method for monitoring cardiac dynamics using electrical bioimpedance (EBI) measurements. Since its appearance more than 40 years ago, ICG has been used for assessing hemodynamic parameters. This paper presents a measurement system based on two System on Chip (SoC) solutions and Raspberry PI, implementing both a full three-lead ECG recorder and an impedance cardiographer, for educational and research development purposes. Raspberry PI is a platform supporting Do-It-Yourself project and education applications across the world. The development is part of Biosignal PI, an open hardware platform focusing in quick prototyping of physiological measurement instrumentation. The SoC used for sensing cardiac biopotential is the ADAS1000, and for the EBI measurement is the AD5933. The recordings were wirelessly transmitted through Bluetooth to a PC, where the waveforms were displayed, and hemodynamic parameters such as heart rate, stroke volume, ejection time and cardiac output were extracted from the ICG and ECG recordings. These results show how Raspberry PI can be used for quick prototyping using relatively widely available and affordable components, for supporting developers in research and engineering education. The design and development documents will be available on www.BiosignalPI.com, for open access under a Non Commercial-Share A like 4.0 International License. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs) applications produce large amount of data, which require high transmission rates. An efficient and seamless delivery of multimedia services in WMSN s is still a challenging task. This article presents the design and implementation of a video surveillance system for linear wireless multimedia sensor networks. We adopt a procedure in which every node has unique IP address and can establish a route from itself to sink through multi-hop communication. We present a dynamic queue scheduler which filters the packets according to packet priority. The core component of this system is an open source hardware platform, which is based on Raspberry Pi sensor nodes. Our network is extensively evaluated on 7 Raspberry Pi sensor nodes. We present results of 7 -node real-world deployment in video surveillance application and show that it works well in long-term deployments. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - We present an open hardware and software platform to efficiently fuse heterogeneous sensor data in an automotive/robotic context. The framework presented in this paper provides researchers a base platform in order to develop and evaluate sensor fusion strategies. In contrast to similar approaches, this framework exploits in particular the raw radar data and enables the fusion at low-level. The proposed system utilizes low-level data from radar sensors as well as indirect (e.g. 3D imaging) and direct (e.g. LIDAR) Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors. After a configurable amount of pre-processing at sensor-level, the sensor data is transferred to a centralized platform and aligned temporally and spatially. We demonstrate the transformation of radar data into the 3D coordinate system in order to fuse it with point cloud data from ToF sensors. Due to the modular structure of the framework, it also enables the exploration of various system partitioning concepts. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - A low-cost, low power consumption indoor environment monitoring instrument, called SKOMOBO (school monitoring box), was developed and tested. SKOMOBO includes sensors to monitor temperature/relative humidity, carbon dioxide (CO2), particulate matter and motions. SKOMOBO was developed using the open source hardware Arduino Pro Mini. This paper describes the process of building SKOMOBO, including sensor selection, printed circuit board design, sensor programming and performance evaluation. Two co-located tests have been undertaken; one in the controlled environment and one in the uncontrolled environment. Results show SKOMOBO measurements have high correlations with their commercial equivalents. In the two different testing environments, the R2 of temperature measurements for all six SKOMOBOs were 1. The R2 for relative humidity and CO2 measurements were above 0.9. The result of this work shows the reliability of SKOMOBO on monitoring indoor air quality. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to develop a low cost open source Controller Area Network system that simulates electronic controls in modern automotive vehicles and to evaluate its effectiveness as a teaching aid. The Arduino UNO microcontroller board was chosen as the desired hardware platform and the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) using the Arduino compiler was chosen as the software development environment. Both the Arduino Uno and Arduino IDE/compiler are open source and freely available to students and staff with no proprietary intellectual property costs. The Arduino UNO was interfaced with the Arduino Controller Area Network Bus (CANBus) shield which is also open hardware. Unitec Institute of Technology practices a holistic approach to teaching. As part of its holistic approach to teaching, senior students are encouraged to develop technical artefacts that can be used as teaching aids for junior students, the junior students are introduced to the artefact as part of their course and the artefact is used to encourage junior students to increase their technical proficiency so that when they reach a senior technical level they can develop artefacts too. The holistic approach is considered to be self-sustaining and provides positive role modelling for junior students. The project described in this paper was developed by a senior student and has been used as a teaching aid for junior students congruent with the holistic teaching philosophy practiced at Unitec. The code and circuitry was designed by an exchange Masters student and was used in the papers, APTE 7504 Vehicle Electronic Diagnostics and APTE 6505 Automotive Electronics, to help students understand CANBus operation and design features in an Automotive CANBus application. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - In order to assist researchers explore the full potential of distributed recycling of post-consumer polymer waste, this article describes a recyclebot, which is a waste plastic extruder capable of making commercial quality 3-D printing filament. The device design takes advantage of both the open source hardware methodology and the paradigm developed by the open source self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) 3-D printer community. Specifically, this paper describes the design, fabrication and operation of a RepRapable Recyclebot, which refers to the Recyclebot's ability to provide the filament needed to largely replicate the parts for the Recyclebot on any type of RepRap 3-D printer. The device costs less than $700 in mate rials and can be fabricated in about 24 h. Filament is produced at 0.4 kg/h using 0.24 kWh/kg with a diameter ±4.6%. Thus, filament can be manufactured from commercial pellets for <22% of commercial filament costs. In addition, it can fabricate recycled waste plastic into filament for 2.5 cents/kg, which is <1000X commercial filament costs. The system can fabricate filament from polymers with extrusion temperatures <250 °C and is thus capable of manufacturing custom filament over a wide range of thermopolymers and composites for material science studies of new materials and recyclability studies, as well as research on novel applications of fused filament based 3-D printing. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Three types of highly-customizable open source probe positioning systems are evaluated: (a) mostly 3-D printed, (b) partially printed using OpenBeam kinematic constraints, and (c) a 3-level stack of low-cost commercial single axis micropositioners and some printed parts. All systems use digital distributed manufacturing to enable bespoke features, which can be fabricated with RepRap-class 3-D printer and easily accessible components. They are all flexible in material choice for custom components. The micropositioners can be set up for left-right use and flat or recessed configurations using either mechanical or magnetic mounting. All systems use a manual probe holder that can be customized and enable a quick swap probe system. System (a) is purchased for $100 or fabricated for <$5, (b) fabricated for $25, and (c) fabricated for $145. Each full turn of a knob moves an axis 0.8 mm for (a) and 0.5 mm for (b, c) providing externally measured positional control of 10 µm for the latter. All three designs can utilize a customizable probe holder and tungsten carbide needle for $56. The designs are validated using microchips with known feature sizes and underwent mechanical stress tests. The maximal deflection of (a) was >200 µm, (b) 40 µm and (c) 10 µm. A tradeoff is observed for 3-D printed percent between cost and accuracy. All systems provided substantial cost savings over proprietary products with similar functionality. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Locomotor activity in rodents is routinely assessed in the evaluation of drugs and other behavioural studies. Several proprietary lab equipment are available to measure locomotion, however their prohibitive cost may pose a challenge to newly-established and poorly funded labs. To overcome this challenge we present Actifield, an open source hardware setup to measure locomotor activity in rodents. The design consists of 3D printed and laser-cut parts as well as “off-the-shelf” electronic components. Here we demonstrate that rodent locomotor activity can be recorded using the IR motion detection system employed in Actifield. Moreover, we show in validation experiments that this hardware system is comparable to commercial and open source video tracking systems. Actifield would be particularly useful to labs in need of a reliable and inexpensive equipment that can be easily built. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Critical to maintaining quality control in high-throughput screening is the need for constant monitoring of liquid-dispensing fidelity. Traditional methods involve operator intervention with gravimetric analysis to monitor the gross accuracy of full plate dispenses, visual verification of contents, or dedicated weigh stations on screening platforms that introduce potential bottlenecks and increase the plate-processing cycle time. We present a unique solution using open-source hardware, software, and 3D printing to automate dispenser accuracy determination by providing real-time dispense weight measurements via a network-connected precision balance. This system uses an Arduino microcontroller to connect a precision balance to a local network. By integrating the precision balance as an Internet of Things (IoT) device, it gains the ability to provide real-time gravimetric summaries of dispensing, generate timely alerts when problems are detected, and capture historical dispensing data for future analysis. All collected data can then be accessed via a web interface for reviewing alerts and dispensing information in real time or remotely for timely intervention of dispense errors. The development of this system also leveraged 3D printing to rapidly prototype sensor brackets, mounting solutions, and component enclosures. © 2018 Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening.

AB  - This paper presents an easy-to-use, easy-to-customize, and low cost device for remote monitoring of Cultural Heritage environments such as museums, art galleries, and historical archives. The prototype allows measurements of temperature, relative humidity, and dew point. The chip used is an ESP8266 characterized by on-board Wi-Fi. The hardware design is flexible in order to host extra sensors via I2C bus and easy replacement of microcontroller and sensors in the event of either malfunctions or substitution with newer versions. The device is programmable using the Arduino IDE. The data are sent to an IoT platform that allows real-time visualization, analyses, and download. Tests were performed in laboratory and at the Casa de Convalescencia in Vic (Spain), by monitoring the microenvironment of an exhibition cabinet hosting 18th century ceramics. The results achieved are promising: the open hardware and software approach allows plan further implementations and provides a solid base for device customizations; in terms of technology applied to Cultural Heritage, the implementation of open hardware does not only can lower significantly the costs, but also provides scientifically reliable alternatives to off the shelf technology, as well as enhances end-users capability to develop customized devices that can better address specific needs. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Laboratory automation improves test reproducibility, which is vital to patient care in clinical laboratories. Many small and specialty laboratories are excluded from the benefits of automation due to low sample number, cost, space, and/or lack of automation expertise. The Minimum Viable Option (MVO) automation platform was developed to address these hurdles and fulfill an unmet need. Consumer 3D printing enabled rapid iterative prototyping to allow for a variety of instrumentation and assay setups and procedures. Three MVO versions have been produced. MVOv1.1 successfully performed part of a clinical assay, and results were comparable to those of commercial automation. Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (RPI3) single-board computers with Sense Hardware Attached on Top (HAT) and Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2 hardware were remotely accessed and evaluated for their suitability to qualify the latest MVOv1.2 platform. Sense HAT temperature, barometric pressure, and relative humidity sensors were stable in climate-controlled environments and are useful in identifying appropriate laboratory spaces for automation placement. The RPI3 with camera plus digital dial indicator logged axis travel experiments. RPI3 with camera and Sense HAT as a light source showed promise when used for photometric dispensing tests. Individual well standard curves were necessary for well-to-well light and path length compensations. © 2018 Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening.

AB  - The emerging discussion about the sustainability potential of distributed production is the starting point for this paper. The focus is on the “design global, manufacture local” model. This model builds on the conjunction of the digital commons of knowledge and design with desktop and benchtop manufacturing technologies (from three-dimensional printers and laser cutters to low-tech tools and crafts). Two case studies are presented to illustrate three interlocked practices of this model for degrowth. It is argued that a “design global, manufacture local” model, as exemplified by these case studies, seems to arise in a significantly different political economy from that of the conventional industrial model of mass production. “Design global, manufacture local” may be seen as a platform to bridge digital and knowledge commons with existing physical infrastructures and degrowth communities, in order to achieve distributed modes of collaborative production. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study presents an entirely open-source, low-cost power monitoring system capable of many types of measurements including both loads and supplies such as solar photovoltaic systems. In addition, the system can be fabricated using only open source software and hardware. The design revolves around the Digital Universal Energy Logger (DUEL) Node, which is responsible for reading and properly scaling the voltage and current of a particular load, and then serializing it via an on-board ATTiny85 chip. The configuration of the DUEL node allows for custom sensitivity ranges, and can handle up to 50 A and 300 V. Up to 127 DUEL nodes communicate via Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) on a bus, which can be monitored and logged through an Arduino UNO, or other compatible microcontroller. Using accessible equipment, the DUEL node can be calibrated to a desirable accuracy and error. The DUEL nodes are also completely customizable, making them fit for any input range, where all commercially-available products are fixed range. The open source solution out performs commercial solutions as the price per measurement ($18.25) is significantly smaller, while the number of serviceable channels (1 2 7) is significantly higher. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - The recent emergence of open hardware platforms has drastically reduced the cost required to develop special purpose device architectures. The RISC-V instruction set and associated ecosystem is one such architecture that has become widely popular as the basis for the next generation embedded control systems and IoT devices. Despite the recent popularity of the RISC-V architecture, there is currently very little support for performing architectural experiments of high performance RISC-V devices designed to target high performance computing and high performance analytics applications. Further, there are no general purpose simulation infrastructures that support developing architectural experiments using RISC-V cores coupled to emerging memory devices such as HBM and HMC. As a result, there is currently a significant gap for those seeking to develop high performance architectural models using emerging memory devices and the RISC-V instruction set. The Stake infrastructure is designed to provide integrated simulation capabilities that supports experimentation using RISC-V processing cores as well as emerging memory devices. Stake is constructed using a fusion of the existing RISC-V Spike functional simulation infrastructure coupled to a custom memory generation component within the Sandia Structural Simulation (SST) framework. The result being an integrated simulation infrastructure that has the ability to simulate heterogeneous mixtures of hierarchical caches, traditional DRAM memories and emerging memory devices. We demonstrate this infrastructure with a design study to elicit the efficacy of 64 bit RISC-V cores on executing graph applications using different mixtures of cache, DRAM memories and HMC memories. In this study, we utilize the Graph Analytics Benchmark Suite to drive simulated memory traffic into mixtures of single level and multi-level caches coupled to each of the aforementioned backend memory devices. From this, we determine that in our simulated architecture, the HMC memory configuration with a single (L1) caching layer provides the most advantageous system configuration for executing graph algorithms and applications. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Different process automation requirements among university students and researchers prompted the design and development of a data acquisition and control board for use in automation activities and for taking readings in educational laboratories and industrial environments, using open-source software and hardware. This study includes a detailed description of the solution that was developed to respond to these needs: it begins by presenting the different components that make up the system, which was designed around the Arduino Due platform. It then provides a detailed functional description of these before discussing preliminary trials that were carried out using the test board. These trials proved that the main components function correctly and point to the need to continue work on the prototype board to obtain more conclusive evidence that the expected results have been achieved and to check all component interactions on the final version. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Robotics and computational thinking are ideal tools for developing science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) pedagogy. Today, educational robotics tools emerge with the aim of promoting innovation and motivation of students during the learning process. Robots are becoming more common in our daily lives; therefore, it is important to integrate robots into all levels of our society. This demonstrator focuses on driving the same content through three low-cost robotic educational tools. The first is Scratch, where you can schedule interactive stories, games and animations. The second tool is Crumble, an easy-to-use programmable controller. Its programming interface uses a block programming language that facilitates its use. Finally, Arduino is an open source, hardware- and software-based platform that is easy to use and has great potential for developing robotic applications. This demonstrator aims to present the above platforms as educational robotics tools as the first step into the world of robotics. Throughout this demonstrator an introduction to educational robotics is developed. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Because of the great popularity of the maker movement, the concept of 'Do it yourself' (DIY) has gained considerable public attention. Furthermore, because of the development of rapid prototyping, the rise of open-source hardware and programming languages, the popularization of network communities, and the establishment of maker spaces, DIY has been taken to the next level: 'co-creation.' This concept requires reform to the standard curriculum in information and technology education. Therefore, this study aims to define the key competences of makers to construct the competence indicators of Maker Education for information and technology education in elementary school. On this basis, a curriculum can be developed, and an evaluation system for learning effectiveness can be built to equip students with the abilities to adapt to life and tackle challenges. In this study, the Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM) was applied to collect and analyze data in the form of a questionnaire survey. The subjects were 12 experts from enterprises, governmental institutions, schools and research institutes. The research achievements include 3 factors ('Theoretical knowledge,' 'Practical application,' 'Maker's mindset'), and 10 indicators. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - As a growing number of companies reject intellectual property (IP) monopoly-based business models to embrace libre product development of free and open source hardware and software, there is an urgent need to refurbish the instruments of university-corporate research partnerships. These partnerships generally use a proprietary standard research agreement (PSRA), which for historical reasons contains significant IP monopoly language and restrictions for both the company and the university. Such standard research agreements thus create an artificial barrier to innovation as both companies using a libre model and universities they wish to collaborate with must invest significantly to restructure the contracts. To solve this problem, this article provides a new Sponsored Libre Research Agreement (SLRA). The differences between the agreements are detailed. The advantages of using an SLRA are provided for any type of company and include: (1) minimizing research investments on reporting requirements; (2) reducing delays related to confidentiality and publication embargos; and (3) reducing both transaction and legal costs as well as research time losses associated with IP. Moving to libre agreements both speeds up and reduces costs for setting up collaborative research. Under the SLRA, university researchers can spend more time innovating for the same investment. © 2018 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The current disruptive innovation in civilian drone (UAV) applications has led to an increased need for research and development in UAV technology. The key challenges currently being addressed are related to UAV platform properties such as functionality, reliability, fault tolerance, and endurance, which are all tightly linked to the UAV flight controller hardware and software. The lack of standardization of flight controller architectures and the use of proprietary closed-source flight controllers on many UAV platforms, however, complicates this work: solutions developed for one flight controller may be difficult to port to another without substantial extra development and testing. Using open-source flight controllers mitigates some of these challenges and enables other researchers to validate and build upon existing research. This paper presents a survey of the publicly available open-source drone platform elements that can be used for research and development. The survey covers open-source hardware, software, and simulation drone platforms and compares their main features. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Many efforts are making science more open and accessible; they are mostly concentrated on issues that appear before and after experiments are performed: open access journals, open databases, and many other tools to increase reproducibility of science and access to information. However, these initiatives do not promote access to scientific equipment necessary for experiments. Mostly due to monetary constraints, equipment availability has always been uneven around the globe, affecting predominantly low-income countries and institutions. Here, a case is made for the use of free open source hardware in research and education, including countries and institutions where funds were never the biggest problem.

AB  - Barriers to inventing electronic devices involve challenges of iterating electronic designs due to long lead times for professional circuit board milling or high costs of commercial milling machines. To overcome these barriers, this study provides open source (OS) designs for a low-cost circuit milling machine. First, design modifications for mechanical and electrical subsystems of the OS Distributed 3-D (D3D) Robotics prototyping system are provided. Next, Copper Carve, an OS custom graphical user interface, is developed to enable circuit board milling by implementing backlash and substrate distortion compensation. The performance of the OS D3D circuit mill is then quantified and validated for: positional accuracy, cut quality, feature accuracy, and distortion compensation. Finally, the return on investment is calculated for inventors using it. The results show by properly compensating for motion inaccuracies with Copper Carve, the machine achieves a motion resolution of 10 microns, which is more than adequate for most circuit designs. The mill is at least five times less expensive than all commercial alternatives and the material costs of the D3D mill are repaid from fabricating 20–43 boards. The results show that the OS circuit mill is of high-enough quality to enable rapid invention and distributed manufacturing of complex products containing custom electronics. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - We present the Kilogrid, an open-source virtualization environment and data logging manager for the Kilobot robot, Kilobot for short. The Kilogrid has been designed to extend the sensory-motor abilities of the Kilobot, to simplify the task of collecting data during experiments, and to provide researchers with a tool to fine-control the experimental setup and its parameters. Based on the design of the Kilobot and compatible with existing hardware, the Kilogrid is a modular system composed of a grid of computing nodes, or modules that provides a bidirectional communication channel between the Kilobots and a remote workstation. In this paper, we describe the hardware and software architecture of the Kilogrid system as well as its functioning to accompany its release as a new open hardware tool for the swarm robotics community. We demonstrate the capabilities of the Kilogrid using a 200-module Kilogrid, swarms of up to 100 Kilobots, and four different case studies: exploration and obstacle avoidance, site selection based on multiple gradients, plant watering, and pheromone-based foraging. Through this set of case studies, we show how the Kilogrid allows the experimenter to virtualize sensors and actuators not available to the Kilobot and to automatize the collection of data essential for the analysis of the experiments. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This paper describes the use of an instrumented bicycle and its computational model for teaching multibody dynamics. The presented approach employs the Whipple model for the kinematic and inverse dynamic simulation of a bicycle ride using as an input three generalized coordinates registered with digital sensors. During the experimental phase, students ride the instrumented bicycle to collect the necessary sensor data. The kinematic and inverse dynamic simulations based on these signals provide a full picture of the motion of the system in different positions and at a range of velocities and accelerations. In addition, they estimate the traction, control, and tire-to-road contact forces during the ride. To validate the simulated results, the simulated velocity and accelerations are compared with the data acquired with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) installed on the bicycle. The paper describes the experimental setup of the instrumented bicycle, enabling readers to build the very same system for their own educational use. The instrumented bicycle system is based on open-source software and as much as possible on open hardware. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Microcontrollers are programmable, integrated circuit chips. In the last two decades, their applications to industrial instruments, vehicles, and household appliances have reached the extent that microcontrollers are now the number-one selling electronic chip of all kinds. Simultaneously, the field of lab-on-a-chip research and technology has seen major technological leaps towards sample handling, sample preparation, and sensing for use in molecular diagnostic devices. Yet, the transformation from a laboratory based lab-on-a-chip technology to actual point-of-care device products has largely been limited to a fraction of the foreseen potential. We believe that increased knowledge of the vast possibilities that becomes available with open source microcontrollers, especially when embedded in easy-to-use development environments, such as the Arduino or Raspberry Pi, could potentially solve and even bridge the gap between lab-on-a-chip technology and real-life point of care applications. The profuse availability and extraordinary capabilities of microcontrollers, namely within computation, communication, and networking, combined with easy-to-use development environments, as well as a very active and fast moving community of makers, who are eager to share their knowledge, could potentially be the difference between a dreadful "chip-in-a-lab"-situation, and the next successful start-up. Here follows a brief insight into how open source microcontrollers could potentially have a transformative effect on the field of lab-on-a-chip research and technology. Details in some specific areas of application are briefly treated before addressing challenges and future perspectives. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - It is suggested to improve the level of security by applying the open source paradigm to the entire IT supply chain and by subjecting the resulting components to verification when required. This would lead to a new trajectory for IT product development which could even increase the efficiency of addressing novel types of hardware-oriented attacks or employing stealthy hardware features. This could require increased transparency of semiconductor fabs. For designing open hardware several nuclei already exist. The proposed path would hold particular promise for security-critical components, which could be specified in such a way as to precisely match hardware characteristics. As some components would continue to be built using existing components for some time, a generalized a priori statement about the security of the complete supply chain, such as 'verified' or 'proven', will initially be impossible. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - The current ongoing work of the CubeSat Development Initiative is to build a small spacecraft system using open source software and open hardware principles. The main objective of the development is to give access to space for little payloads, which can be planned and executed by researchers, designers and even understudies majoring in science, technology, engineering, and math and different orders to play out a huge number of planned missions. To design and develop any system, requirement engineering plays a vital role as it describes the functional and non-functional requirements of the system. The work presented in this paper is focused on developing a requirement engineering tool that can be used to increase the requirement elicitation and specification of system-wide qualities based on the use of quality attribute scenarios. The model-based requirement engineering tool described in the paper allows to link non-functional requirements and functional requirements. It utilizes quality attribute scenarios (templates) which are proposed by Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute (SEI). © 2018 TSI Press.

AB  - This paper mainly introduces the the control system of micro AUV based on open source hardware. The control system is the most important part of the AUV and its performance has a direct impact on the stability and reliability of AUV. Due to the small size and limited energy, micro AUV puts more restrictions on the volume and power consumption of the control system. In this paper, we choose the BeagleBone Black, the open source hardware, as the main controller, the rich peripheral interface of it facilitates data acquisition and centralized processing of the vehicle. Arduino, another type of open source hardware, is used as the node controller of the control system. Compared with the traditional hardware design, this architecture has the advantages of small volume, low power consumption, low cost, short period of development and maintenance, and it also had good performance in data processing and real-time control. The experimental results showed that the control system based on this architecture run effectively. © 2018 IEEE.

In-storage anti-virus systems are able to isolate malicious effects from main computing platforms, and they reduce the system overhead for virus detection. We implement our in-storage anti-virus platform using cost-effective, open-source hardware, and we verify that is practically applicable to storage devices.

AB  - The design and construction of a low-cost and compact USB photometer based on open source hardware and software is described. The device, featuring a 1 ms sample acquisition time, utilizes a single interchangeable light emitting diode (LED) as a light source in combination with photodiode detectors and a Texas Instruments LaunchPad as the main control unit. An appropriately constructed flow cell can be connected to a flow reactor made out of transparent polymeric material such as perfluoroalkoxy (PFA) tubing. The flow cell can be moved to different positions of the tube in order to take measurements at different residence times without having to disassemble the photometer or the flow reactor system. The bespoke photometer was used to determine the residence time distribution (RTD) of various microreactors/micromixers, as well as for measuring the reaction rate constant for the base-induced hydrolysis of p-nitrophenol acetate in a biphasic segmented flow system. Owing to the 1 ms sample acquisition time of the novel device the lengths of individual segments can be measured in real time. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - We describe the development of a robust, self-sustainable, versatile environmental monitoring station, the S3ME2, with a multitude of sensors capable of operating in extreme environments (from cold arid sub-Arctic regions to hot deserts and high-Altitude mountain terrains), providing realtime quality data of critical climate and geophysical parameters for a wide field of research such as pressure, surface and subsurface temperature and humidity, magnetic field and seismic activity. The dedicated communication modem utilizes IoT technology and can deliver this data from remote regions. The S3ME2 has been designed as a low-cost instrument to facilitate the production of multiple units. During the pilot phase, it has demonstrated continuous operability for up to 6 months, including survival during extremely cold, snowy, and low insolation, and low wind periods in the Sub-Arctic region. With its robust design, S3ME2 exploits the use of renewable sources of energy such as solar and wind power to power the system. The S3ME2 has also been designed from a modular point of view with commercial off the shelf components (COTS) and open source hardware, considering long term operability of the station. The sensor modules can be easily added, replaced, or upgraded such that a stable functioning of the system is guaranteed. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - We introduce Dimitri, an open-software & open-hardware humanoid robot with 31 DOFs, fitted with cost-effective modular compliant joints and parallel link legs, designed for advanced human-robot interaction research, force-informed object handling and intelligent environment discovery. Our main innovation is in the design of a robust full-body biped humanoid robot equipped with very low-cost polyurethane torsional spring fixed to traditional servo motors and a circuit to measure angular displacement, transforming the system into a series elastic actuator (SEA). In order to illustrate the robot’s qualities in the field of machine learning applied to robotics and manipulation, a multiple timescale recurrent neural network (MTRNN) is implemented, allowing the robot to replicate combined movement sequences earlier taught via interactive demonstration. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Background. A trainer for online laparoscopic surgical skills assessment based on the performance of experts and nonexperts is presented. The system uses computer vision, augmented reality, and artificial intelligence algorithms, implemented into a Raspberry Pi board with Python programming language. Methods. Two training tasks were evaluated by the laparoscopic system: transferring and pattern cutting. Computer vision libraries were used to obtain the number of transferred points and simulated pattern cutting trace by means of tracking of the laparoscopic instrument. An artificial neural network (ANN) was trained to learn from experts and nonexperts’ behavior for pattern cutting task, whereas the assessment of transferring task was performed using a preestablished threshold. Four expert surgeons in laparoscopic surgery, from hospital “Raymundo Abarca Alarcón,” constituted the experienced class for the ANN. Sixteen trainees (10 medical students and 6 residents) without laparoscopic surgical skills and limited experience in minimal invasive techniques from School of Medicine at Universidad Autónoma de Guerrero constituted the nonexperienced class. Data from participants performing 5 daily repetitions for each task during 5 days were used to build the ANN. Results. The participants tend to improve their learning curve and dexterity with this laparoscopic training system. The classifier shows mean accuracy and receiver operating characteristic curve of 90.98% and 0.93, respectively. Moreover, the ANN was able to evaluate the psychomotor skills of users into 2 classes: experienced or nonexperienced. Conclusion. We constructed and evaluated an affordable laparoscopic trainer system using computer vision, augmented reality, and an artificial intelligence algorithm. The proposed trainer has the potential to increase the self-confidence of trainees and to be applied to programs with limited resources. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - In transportation cyber-physical systems (TCPS), data are collected from different transportation modes and from a wide variety of data collection devices. TCPS data have characteristics that can be described using '5Vs of big data': (1) volume, (2) variety, (3) velocity, (4) veracity and (5) value (Demchenko et al., 2013) Volume represents the raw amount of data to be stored. Velocity represents the rate at which data are being collected and inserted into the data infrastructure and how fast the back end services are expected to process these data streams. The variety aspect arises from the fact that in a data-driven environment, it is inevitable for service providers to collect and combine data from numerous different sources for creating actionable insights. As a result, data will come into the infrastructure under different data formats. With increases in data size, rate of data arrival and number of data sources, the reliability of data contents will certainly decrease. This is the veracity aspect. The final V, value, represents the desired outcome for investing in TCPS data, because all efforts are for nought if usable insights cannot be generated from the data. All of these characteristics make traditional database management systems and conventional data processing and delivery systems inappropriate for many types of transportation data analysis and decision support tasks. An enormous amount of heterogeneous data cannot be processed in real time. This chapter introduces the modern data infrastructures that are needed to support TCPS. The focus is on open-source hardware and software technologies that support data management and delivery systems. The chapter also includes a discussion of infrastructure as code that can leverage emerging commercial cloud facilities. © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - There are over 4,500 institutions of higher education in the United States, of those over 1,800 are Bachelor degree granting institution [1]. If 1 in 20 has a campus observatory, that is still nearly 200 small telescopes spread across the country. While certainly the sites are less than ideal and many campus telescopes will be small, ~30-40 cm in diameter, this number of telescopes is still significant and could be especially useful for transient studies in the LSST era. The educational and outreach impact of having robotic observatories at educational institutions is also profound. Realizing the potential of these telescopes requires automating and connecting them into a network. The Robotic Observatory by HARDWARE.astronomy and Telescope Network, or ROBH.aT Network (pronounced "robot") aims to do just this by leveraging open-source hardware devices to develop the hardware necessary to robotize a telescope at low-cost and with primarily undergraduate students. Here we report of the initial work in automating the observatory at Winona State University. © 2016 SPIE.

AB  - As a result of the globalisation of the semiconductor design and fabrication processes, integrated circuits are becoming increasingly vulnerable to malicious attacks. The most concerning threats are hardware trojans. A hardware trojan is a malicious inclusion or alteration to the existing design of an integrated circuit, with the possible effects ranging from leakage of sensitive information to the complete destruction of the integrated circuit itself. While the majority of existing detection schemes focus on test-time, they all require expensive methodologies to detect hardware trojans. Off-the-shelf approaches have often been overlooked due to limited hardware resources and detection accuracy. With the advances in technologies and the democratisation of open-source hardware, however, these tools enable the detection of hardware trojans at reduced costs during or after production. In this manuscript, a hardware trojan is created and emulated on a consumer FPGA board. The experiments to detect the trojan in a dormant and active state are made using off-the-shelf technologies taking advantage of different techniques such as Power Analysis Reports, Side Channel Analysis and Thermal Measurements. Furthermore, multiple attempts to detect the trojan are demonstrated and benchmarked. Our simulations result in a state-of-the-art methodology to accurately detect the trojan in both dormant and active states using off-the-shelf hardware. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - This paper presents a solution for different activities concerning shrimp farming, especially focused on the middle-class artisanal productive sector, using both open source hardware and open source software. The proposal aims to optimize monitoring during shrimp farming, measuring parameters, such as dissolved oxygen, water temperature and food levels inside reservoirs, in order to have a real-time reading of parameters. In case critical values appear, an alarm activates by control center, notifying by either electronic mail or web interface. The attractiveness of the proposal consists in the automation of the feeding system, which provides food supply to shrimps at certain daily periods, controlling by web interface the different options the breeder has available, a process that can be even managed remotely. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper, a general architecture for the implementation of software-defined optoelectronic systems is described. This concept harnesses the flexibility of software-defined hardware to implement optoelectronic systems which can be configured to adapt to multiple high speed optical engineering applications. As an application example, a software-defined optical interferometer using a commercial software-defined radio platform is built. The system is tested by performing high speed optical detection of laser-induced photoacoustic signals in a concentrated dye solution. Using software modifications only, conventional single carrier and also multicarrier heterodyne techniques with space and frequency diversity are performed. The latter technique shows a noticeable performance improvement in single-shot interferometric measurements. © 2001-2012 IEEE.

AB  - “Smart” water systems are transforming the field of stormwater management by enabling real-time monitoring and control of previously static infrastructure. While the localized benefits of active control are well-established, the potential for system-scale control of watersheds is poorly understood. This study shows how a real-world smart stormwater system can be leveraged to shape streamflow within an urban watershed. Specifically, we coordinate releases from two internet-controlled stormwater basins to achieve desired control objectives downstream—such as maintaining the flow at a set-point, and generating interleaved waves. In the first part of the study, we describe the construction of the control network using a low-cost, open-source hardware stack and a cloud-based controller scheduling application. Next, we characterize the system’s control capabilities by determining the travel times, decay times, and magnitudes of various waves released from the upstream retention basins. With this characterization in hand, we use the system to generate two desired responses at a critical downstream junction. First, we generate a set-point hydrograph, in which flow is maintained at an approximately constant rate. Next, we generate a series of overlapping and interleaved waves using timed releases from both retention basins. We discuss how these control strategies can be used to stabilize flows, thereby mitigating streambed erosion and reducing contaminant loads into downstream waterbodies. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Many Internet of Things (IoT) applications are emerging and evolving rapidly thanks to widespread open-source hardware platforms. Most of the high-end open-source IoT platforms include built-in peripherals, such as the universal asynchronous receiver and transmitter (UART), pulse width modulation (PWM), general purpose input output (GPIO) ports and timers, and have enough computation power to run embedded operating systems such as Linux. However, each IoT platform has its own way of configuring peripherals, and it is difficult for programmers or users to configure the same peripheral on a different platform. Although diverse open-source IoT platforms are widespread, the difficulty in programming those platforms hinders the growth of IoT applications. Therefore, we propose an easy and convenient way to program and configure the operation of each peripheral using a user-friendly Web-based software framework. Through the implementation of the software framework and the real mobile robot application development along with it, we show the feasibility of the proposed software framework, named SoEasy. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - In this work, we attempt to design a dataglove to assist sign language users communicate with non-users. We focus our work on designing a low cost dataglove using open source hardware and software. We run algorithms on the micro controller to interpret basic gestures and phrases. The interpretation results are sent wirelessly to a bluetooth enabled smartphone to be displayed on screen. We benchmark the interpretation accuracy on three different users. Our results show that most basic sign gestures can be interpreted rather accurately using only simple algorithms. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Air quality has become a serious concern from the world's leading universities. The campus as a learning area needs good air quality and needs to monitor and maintain it so that academics can engage in healthy and optimal activities. This study develops a system for monitoring outdoor air quality on campus by using a wireless sensor network (WSN). MQTT Protocol is used to maximize data transmission from sensor nodes to brokers via wireless local area network (WLAN). Air quality measurement data is reported in real time via a web server that can be accessed via the internet. Sensor nodes and brokers are built using open source hardware and software. The system is implemented for measuring air quality on campus and shows measurements that are accurate, real time, and can be accessed via the web. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Autonomous Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) have the potential to assist in real-life tasks involving grasping and transportation, but not before solving several difficult research challenges. In this work, we address the design, control, estimation, and planning problems for cooperative localization, grasping, and transportation of objects in challenging outdoor scenarios. We demonstrate an autonomous team of MAVs able to plan safe trajectories for manipulation of ferrous objects, while guaranteeing interrobot collision avoidance and automatically creating a map of the objects in the environment. Our solution is predominantly distributed, allowing the team to pick and transport ferrous disks to a final destination without collisions. This result is achieved using a new magnetic gripper with a novel feedback approach, enabling the detection of successful grasping. The gripper design and all the components to build a platform are clearly provided as open-source hardware for reuse by the community. Finally, the proposed solution is validated through experimental results, where difficulties include inconsistent wind, uneven terrain, and sandy conditions. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Artificial vision algorithms are approaching human performance in many respects. However, their computational demands are also growing, which constraints their use in mobile and time-sensitive robots. Biological vision presents a well known practical solution. Specifically, primates limit the computational demands of vision by processing only small parts of the scene in detail, and frequently reorienting the eyes to different locations. Artificial vision is much more power-intensive than biological vision, so this strategy is likely to be increasingly relevant to robots, as they become more visually sophisticated. To facilitate progress and reduce duplication of work in this area, we have developed a 7-degree-of-freedom robotic head that supports such rapid saccade-like camera movements, and we are releasing the design files under an open-hardware license. The system supports C-mount cameras, large foveated lenses, and liquid lenses that allow rapid changes in focus distance. It also has a stereo baseline that is roughly the same as that of humans, to support stereo processing of nearby objects in grasping and manipulation tasks. The main contributions of this work are the mechanical design, and the demonstration that its stereo baseline, range of motion, and saccade velocity are similar to those of primate systems. The main general advantages over existing robotic heads are speed and the open-hardware license. The system would also be an ideal platform for future research that aims to replicate the performance of primate vision systems. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Fog computing is gaining attention due to the potential of aggregating and processing time-sensitive data at the nearby intelligent gateways. It reduces the latency of sensors data aggregation and response time therefore, improve real-time action which is beneficial in environmental monitoring and early warning systems. However, deploying edge computing in Internet-less environment seems unpractical and the mobility of gateways is less focused in current literature. In this paper, we present a practical design of a portable gateways scheme for sensors data aggregation and processing in Internet-less environment. The proposed gateways can locate their geographical locations which can be automatically converted into location names at the central gateway. The proposed portable Fog Gateways are developed by using open-source hardware and integrated with Cloud database for data storage. Data processing techniques such as data parsing and Reverse Geocoding are conducted for reliable data transmission by using GSM/GPRS technology and geographical location name detection respectively. Finally, a case study has been conducted to evaluate the feasibility of our proposed Fog Gateways scheme in real-time application. © 2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.

AB  - Some countries in South America such as Ecuador, Colombia and Peru have increased their presence in the production and export of orchids. Ecuador has 14% of the world's species and in 2014 its orchid exports increased 8%, this shows the importance of this product for the country. An orchid greenhouse is a botanical garden specialized in the cultivation, preservation and exhibition of orchids, these places require that physical variables such as ambient temperature, humidity and illuminance to be continuously monitored and controlled for the proper growth of orchids. The present work proposes the design, prototyping and deployment of a wireless sensor network for the monitoring of physical variables in the Municipal orchid greenhouse of Loja, based on open hardware technology. As a result, two prototypes were implemented: one from the variable monitoring node and the other from the central node for visualization and recording of variables. For the validation of the prototypes, performance tests were carried out in the field. Approximately 3000 samples were obtained with a 100% reliability rate in the transit of the data within the process of acquisition, transmission, reception and storage. © 2018 AISTI.

AB  - MANET (Mobile Ad Hoc Network) researchers have shown increased interest in using mobile robot technology for their testbed platforms. Thus, the main motivation of this paper is to review various robot-based MANET testbeds that have been developed in previously reported research. Additionally, suggestions to heighten mobility mechanisms by using mobile robots to be more practical, easy and inexpensive are also included in this paper, as we unveils ToMRobot, a low-cost MANET robot created from an ordinary remote control car that is capable of performing a real system MANET testbed with the addition of only a few low-cost electronic components. Despite greatly reduced costs, the ToMRobot does not sacrifice any of the necessary MANET basic structures and will still be easily customisable and upgradeable through the use of open hardware technology like Cubieboard2 and Arduino, as its robot controller. This paper will also include guidelines to enable technically limited MANET researchers to design and develop the ToMRobot. It is hoped that this paper achieves its two pronged objectives namely (i) to facilitate other MANET researchers by providing them with a source of reference that eases their decision making for selecting the best and most suitable MANET mobile robots for real mobility in their MANET testbeds (ii) to provide MANET researchers with a prospect of building their own MANET robots that can be applied in their own MANET testbed in the future. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The pumping system of the Administration Board of Drinking Water and Sanitation of the Algarrobera (JAAPS-LA) is made up of a cylindrical aquifer with dimensions of 70 meters deep and 0.305 meters in diameter, the central element of this system is the submersible pump electrical, which is controlled by time. This current system has some deficiencies, among them the shortage of drinking water when the demand of the users is higher than the nominal one; and the large waste of potable water when the demand is lower than the nominal one. The present work proposes the design, implementation and integration of a monitoring and automation system applied to the JAAPS-LA pumping system, based on a wireless sensor network, open hardware and a PLC. As a result, all the modules of the system were implemented: the liquid level acquisition module in the distribution tank by means of liquid level sensors; the wireless data transmission and reception module; the drive module of the pump by means of the Programmable logic controller (PLC); and, finally, the solar-photovoltaic energy capture module. To evaluate the performance of the monitoring and automation system implemented, the behavior was monitored for 4 days, with the data obtained it was possible to verify the correct pump drive logic and the high efficiency (100%) of the communication system. © 2018 AISTI.

AB  - Robotic automation is considered as the fourth industrial revolution by multiple industrialists. Robots are faster, more accurate, less error-prone and cost-effective when compared to human beings. For big companies, it is estimated that by 2025, labor cost savings from the adoption of advanced industrial robots would surpass 20%. However, for small and medium companies, industrial robots are still expensive and unaffordable. Fortunately, with the advent of Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence, open source hardware and software, and the declining price of electronic components, a new generation of smaller, cheaper and friendlier robots are emerging, for small and medium businesses. In this paper, we propose the simulation of an Indoor Positioning System (IPS) robot, which performs a forklift operation in a warehouse. The system uses Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology, and Java programming language for exchanging data from a server. An ESP8266 NodeMCU module, an Arduino microcontroller and various components such as MFRC522 to read RFID tags, Ultrasonic Sensors HC-SR04 for detecting obstacles are used. This resulted in a very low cost, reliable and multifunctional system. Simulations have demonstrated that the mobile robot can transmit packets over the network to a local server for mapping without losses. Moreover, it can receive packets from the server to obtain destination points and mapping obstacles while moving around the RFID tagged floor. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Technology have gifted many security system to society of which GSM based security system are more corpulent. In many security systems, Sensors are the backbone of the system which look no more than an alarming system detecting movement. This sort of technology has now become insignificant and inefficient as many times the alarm goes off unwarranted. In this paper we have proposed and implemented a theft control system for jewellery shop, providing a handshaking surveillance with CCTV footages, which in its own essence is a security system by itself, and is being currently used to control attempts to theft or robbery. The proposed security system is an advanced security system that makes use of an embedded system (comprises an open hardware microcontroller and a GSM modem) working on the principles of Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) technology, motion sensors, a specially designed floor mat consisting of series of push buttons, RF transmitter & receiver and high beam lights. It informs the owner as well as the nearest police station about the intruder through SMS or call and it turns on a high intensity halogen lamp that prevents the robber from absconding the crime scene. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - This paper describes the initial development of a low-cost Lagrangian drifter based on solar panels, ultracapacitor and open hardware-software platform. The drifter is powered by a solar panel and a single Ultracapacitor that stores the energy. The drifter has a sensor suite formed by a GPS, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity sensors and a camera. The energy management and signal processing from sensors is supported by an Arduino Mega development board. The communications between the ground station and a deployed drifter is based on Iridium Satellite Terminal. All mechanical and electronic components are self-contained in a pressure housing. The main purpose of this Lagrangian drifter is: detect a red tide near Ecuadorian coasts, obtain physical-chemical parameters in-situ then send the measurements trough a satellite network to a ground station. Results from sea trials are shown. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - In 2013 the Competition for Authenticated Encryption: Security, Applicability, and Robustness (CAESAR) was started. It aims at determining a portfolio of ciphers for authenticated encryption that has advantages over AES-GCM in terms of performance, security, and ease of implementation. This competition, for the first time, provides a standardized hardware API, which allows a fair comparison of hardware implementations. However, the community still lacks a common platform to automatically test hardware implementations, confirm implementation claims, and benchmark performance figures on real hardware in terms of runtime, area, power and energy consumption. In this work, we present a common platform using the CAESAR-API in a Xilinx Zynq-7000 System on Chip (SoC) with ARM processors and an AXI interface. This reflects a typical real world usage scenario for hardware-accelerators and thus extends the work for a fair comparison of hardware implementations in three dimensions: first the API is evaluated on a real SoC, which shows, e.g. the performance of the API. Second, it provides a hardware platform to test the proposed implementations of the candidates easily. This can be used by future designers, as we will provide it as open source hardware. Finally, we ran all published hardware implementations of the current 3rd-round candidates during which we identified several implementation weaknesses, e.g. presumably unintended latches in the design, hence emphasizing the importance of testing hardware proposals on real hardware. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Recent years demonstrate an increased interest in low-cost Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) in citizen science for ecological monitoring and environmental protection. However, most efforts have targeted land use, leaving ocean and nautical applications greatly unexplored. In this paper we present the design, deployment and testing of POSEIDON, a low-cost PAM system for nautical citizen science and real-time acoustic augmentation of whale-watching experiences. POSEIDON uses machine learning techniques to identify vocal acoustic samples of common cetaceans like whales and dolphins. When discriminating the calls, we find that Extra Trees and Gradient Boosting outperform other classifiers (>0.95 confidence threshold). The features extracted from the machine learning models are used to enhance the whale watching experience and provide citizen science data to marine biologists and environmental protection agencies. While this paper focuses on the design of the system, future work will focus on user testing and widespread deployment of open-hardware and software for nautical PAM applications. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Supported by easier and cheaper access to tools and expanding communities, maker cultures are pointing towards the ideas of (almost) everyone designing, creating, producing and distributing renewed, new and improved products, machines, things or artefacts. A careful analysis of the assumptions and challenges of maker cultures emphasizes the relevance of what may be called technological action, that is, active and critical interventions regarding the purposes and applications of technologies within ordinary lives, thus countering the deterministic trends of current directions of technology. In such transformative potential, we will explore a set of elements what is and could be technological action through snapshots of maker cultures based on the empirical research conducted in three particular contexts: the Fab Lab Network, Maker Media core outputs and initiatives such as Maker Faires, and the Open Source Hardware Association (OSHWA). Elements such as control and empowerment through material engagement, openness and sharing, and social, cultural, political and ethical values of the common good in topics such as diversity, sustainability and transparency, are critically analysed. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - A promising approach to reducing the >870, 000 deaths/year globally from unsafe water is flow-through solar water pasteurization systems (SWPs). Unfortunately, demonstrated systems have high capital costs, which limits access for the poor. The most expensive component of such systems is the heat exchanger (HX). Thus, this study focuses on cost optimization of HX designs for flow-through SWPs using high-effectiveness polymer microchannel HXs. The theoretical foundation for the cost optimization of a polymer microchannel HX is provided, and outputs are plotted in order to provide guidelines for designers to perform HX optimizations. These plots are used in two case studies: (1) substitution of a coiled copper HX with polymer microchannel HX, and (2) design of a polymer microchannel HX for a 3-D printed collector that can fit in an arbitrary build volume. The results show that substitution of the polymer expanded HX reduced the overall expenditure for the system by a factor 50, which aids in making the system more economical. For the second case study, the results show how future system designers can optimize an HX for an arbitrary SWP geometry. The approach of distributed manufacturing using laser welding appears promising for HX for SWP. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This paper explores three cases of Do-It-Yourself, open-source technologies developed within the diverse array of topics and themes in the communities around the Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science (Public Lab). These cases focus on aerial mapping, water quality monitoring and civic science practices. The techniques discussed have in common the use of accessible, community-built technologies for acquiring data. They are also concerned with embedding collaborative and open source principles into the objects, tools, social formations and data sharing practices that emerge from these inquiries. The focus is on developing processes of collaborative design and experimentation through material engagement with technology and issues of concern. Problem-solving, here, is a tactic, while the strategy is an ongoing engagement with the problem of participation in its technological, social and political dimensions especially considering the increasing centralization and specialization of scientific and technological expertise. The authors also discuss and reflect on the Public Lab’s approach to civic science in light of ideas and practices of citizen/civic veillance, or “sousveillance”, by emphasizing people before data, and by investigating the new ways of seeing and doing that this shift in perspective might provide. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - To be able to use robots of the same type in a swarm (in this case differential–drive robots) from a centralized computer, you need to control them in the same way even if the robots come from different manufacturers. These robots should have the same capabilities: i.e. the same type of sensors and the same type of control commands. Currently, if we need to add sensors on a robot, we should first find out what are the hardware capabilities and what are the tools provided by the manufacturer (some have microcontrollers, others have ARM processors). The protocol to communicate with the onboard card (often a serial protocol) is different for each robot and we have to take that in account in our software so that the robots can be interchangeable. This paper describes the design and the results of using a standard interface (bridge) on a robot which allows wireless communication with a centralized computer and local serial communication with a mobile robot. On this interface, we can connect every sensor we want (infrared, ultrasound, laser, Kinect etc.) and we can always use the same tools to control them. Extension of the protocol of the Kobuki base (Turtle-Bot 2) is proposed to be able to use the same type of frame as the TurtleBot 2 uses and to continue to use ROS middleware as is, but with the possibility to use data from new sensors implemented on the bridge. This article will focus on the use of the TurtleBot 2, but the same bridge will be adapted to other robots allowing their interchangeability in the future. © 2018 ADVANCES IN ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING.

AB  - This paper presents a novel method of automating experimental measurements in a laboratory environment. The acquisition and analysis of experimental data is possible using electronic sensors, open source software and hardware environment that makes the whole process simpler. This paper presents an experimental environment of testing of a centrifugal pump. However, the same approach can be extended to similar experiments that involve measurement of various parameters. In this experiment pressures, flow rate and speed that are essential parameters in a typical pump testing is measured using sensors and interfaced with the open source hardware Arduino. The advantage of using this approach is easy readability, more accurate and time saving. Different sensors that are used and calibration procedures involved are explained. The instrument chain consisting of sensors, Arduino and personal computer needed for the analysis of acquired data is explained. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a cost-effective implementation method of a ball and plate system as an educational kit and present the application of sliding mode control to achieve better control performance. We choose a Stewart platform with rotary actuators to manipulate the plate. We explain the construction method of the platform in detail. We use a touch panel as a sensor to obtain the positional data at a high sample rate and to make the system compact. As a main control unit, we use a Nucleo-32 board, which is a small and powerful open source hardware with a built-in floating point unit. For controller synthesis, we show a mathematical model of the ball and plate system and explain the kinematics analysis of the Stewart platform. We design a sliding mode controller that includes error integration, which makes the system robust against external disturbances. We describe the results of the simulations and the experiments and then illustrate the advantage of the applied sliding mode control compared to LQ control. The proposed system is cost-effective, can be easily built, has good control performance, and occupies a small space. For these reasons, we expect that the system can be efficiently used as an educational tool. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Currently available interactive technologies and infrastructure such as open source hardware, increased processing power, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), Natural Language processing (NLP) and connectivity through the internet, have led to a new definition of human living. Smart homes, smart streets, smart cities and eventually a smarter planet, is what humans are progressing towards. The boon in things being smart is that it involves automation and interactive technologies, something that we as humans prefer over introvert and monotonous characteristic of machines. However, most present systems have a physical entity like a remote or a personal device assistant (PDA) which is used to control our homes. When the access to these physical devices is lost, you can no longer control them. This paper addresses this very issue and proposes a solution which eliminates the need for any physical device. It proposes a multi-functional 'Smart Home Automation System' (SHAS) controlled using an interactive and humanoid central processing unit which is powered by features of AI and NLP. Voice-commands to control the devices of the house such as fans, lights, doors, etc. can be given by the residents. The system is also intelligent enough to search things which it doesn't quite understand using the internet. The system has a camera integrated for continuously monitoring the home and also uses image processing techniques to identify the people trying to access the house. The system also has an automated mailing system which e-mails photos captured by the camera based on valid/invalid users. The system is aimed at being easy, cost-effective and non-physical. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - The cost of specialized scientific equipment can be high and with limited funding resources, researchers and students are often unable to access or purchase the ideal equipment for their projects. In the fields of materials science and mechanical engineering, fundamental equipment such as tensile testing devices can cost tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars. While a research lab often has access to a large-scale testing machine suitable for conventional samples, loading devices for meso- and micro-scale samples for in-situ testing with the myriad of microscopy tools are often hard to source and cost prohibitive. Open-source software has allowed for great strides in the reduction of costs associated with software development and open-source hardware and additive manufacturing have the potential to similarly reduce the costs of scientific equipment and increase the accessibility of scientific research. To investigate the feasibility of open-source hardware, a micro-tensile tester was designed with a freely accessible computer-aided design package and manufactured with a desktop 3D-printer and off-the-shelf components. To our knowledge this is one of the first demonstrations of a tensile tester with additively manufactured components for scientific research. The capabilities of the tensile tester were demonstrated by investigating the mechanical properties of Graphene Oxide (GO) paper and thin films. A 3D printed tensile tester was successfully used in conjunction with an atomic force microscope to provide one of the first quantitative measurements of GO thin film buckling under compression. The tensile tester was also used in conjunction with an atomic force microscope to observe the change in surface topology of a GO paper in response to increasing tensile strain. No significant change in surface topology was observed in contrast to prior hypotheses from the literature. Based on this result obtained with the new open source tensile stage we propose an alternative hypothesis we term ‘superlamellae consolidation’ to explain the initial deformation of GO paper. The additively manufactured tensile tester tested represents cost savings of >99% compared to commercial solutions in its class and offers simple customization. However, continued development is needed for the tensile tester presented here to approach the technical specifications achievable with commercial solutions. © 2018 Nandy et al.

AB  - The cost, usability and power efficiency of available wildlife monitoring equipment currently inhibits full ground-level coverage of many natural systems. Developments over the last decade in technology, open science, and the sharing economy promise to bring global access to more versatile and more affordable monitoring tools, to improve coverage for conservation researchers and managers. Here we describe the development and proof-of-concept of a low-cost, small-sized and low-energy acoustic detector: “AudioMoth.” The device is open-source and programmable, with diverse applications for recording animal calls or human activity at sample rates of up to 384 kHz. We briefly outline two ongoing real-world case studies of large-scale, long-term monitoring for biodiversity and exploitation of natural resources. These studies demonstrate the potential for AudioMoth to enable a substantial shift away from passive continuous recording by individual devices, towards smart detection by networks of devices flooding large and inaccessible ecosystems. The case studies demonstrate one of the smart capabilities of AudioMoth, to trigger event logging on the basis of classification algorithms that identify specific acoustic events. An algorithm to trigger recordings of the New Forest cicada (Cicadetta montana) demonstrates the potential for AudioMoth to vastly improve the spatial and temporal coverage of surveys for the presence of cryptic animals. An algorithm for logging gunshot events has potential to identify a shotgun blast in tropical rainforest at distances of up to 500 m, extending to 1 km with continuous recording. AudioMoth is more energy efficient than currently available passive acoustic monitoring devices, giving it considerably greater portability and longevity in the field with smaller batteries. At a build cost of ∼US$43 per unit, AudioMoth has potential for varied applications in large-scale, long-term acoustic surveys. With continuing developments in smart, energy-efficient algorithms and diminishing component costs, we are approaching the milestone of local communities being able to afford to remotely monitor their own natural resources. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Robotics is one of the major disruptive technologies of our time, and offers significant opportunities for innovation and competitiveness in the global marketplace. However, in resource-poor countries like India, engineering education is hampered by a lack of access to affordable and innovative hands-on practical education modules for the laboratory. This is especially the case in emerging disciplines like robotics. Moreover, expensive commercial grade robots offer limited scope for experimentation and learning outcomes in an academic setting. This situation can be remedied with the increasing affordability and versatility of open source hardware like microcontrollers and microcomputers, commercial off-The-shelf components like motors, actuators, sensors and power transmission mechanisms, as well as free, open source software. In this paper, a low-cost build your own (BYO) three-link electrically actuated robot manipulator is designed and developed for adoption in robotics and mechatronics laboratory courses. It can be disseminated and adapted on a wide scale at affordable cost for hands-on manufacturing education. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Scientific communities are drawn to the open source model as an increasingly utilitarian method to produce and share work. Initially used as a means to develop freely-available software, open source projects have been applied to hardware including scientific tools. Increasing convenience of 3D printing has fueled the proliferation of open labware projects aiming to develop and share designs for scientific tools that can be produced in-house as inexpensive alternatives to commercial products. We present our design of a micropipette that is assembled from 3D-printable parts and some hardware that works by actuating a disposable syringe to a user-adjustable limit. Graduations on the syringe are used to accurately adjust the set point to the desired volume. Our open design printed micropipette is assessed in comparison with a commercial pipette and meets the ISO 8655 standards. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Prosopis juliflora is a small weed tree, native to Central and South America, and the Caribbean, which has become a major invasive weed in Asia, including India, Latin America, Africa and Australia. It has major detrimental impact on scarce, underground water resources, takes over the local flora ecosystems and affects the soil environment. Manual removal of saplings is time-consuming and expensive. Presently, the removal of the weed is performed manually which is time-consuming, or using very expensive commercial heavy equipment. In this paper, an affordable and innovative unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) - unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) system is designed and developed for autonomous identification and removal of the weed seedlings and saplings. Results of implementation of a proof-of-concept prototype system using mainly commercial off-the-shelf components, open source hardware and free open source software, are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are increasingly becoming integral parts of many non-electrical fields of engineering, e.g., Precision Agriculture, Avionics, Bionics, Civionics, and so on. Modern mechanical engineering is nearly synonymous with Mechatronics, and more recently Mechaphonics, viz., study of mechanical systems controlled by mobile phone apps, has become popular. Pneumatics, or compressed air, and hydraulics are niche areas of mechanical engineering with many industrial and other applications, and their performance is enhanced by incorporating electronic hardware and computer software. Many of these systems are also good examples of so-called smart products and Internet of Things. In this paper, an affordable build-your-own (BYO) computer control system is designed and developed for hands-on instruction in electro-pneumatics education. Results of implementation of a proof-of-concept prototype system using low-cost components, open source hardware and free open source software, are presented to illustrate the practical utility of the proposed system. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - There has been growing popularity in do-it-yourself (DIY) electronics for wearable computing and human-machine interaction. This has introduced exciting opportunities to promote science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics (STEAM) education that highlights the intersection of electronics, materials, and artistic expression. Here, we present a systematic guide to a low-cost (<$10 per student) outreach workshop on wearable electronics for middle school students (and potentially high school students with minor modifications) that is complementary to existing STEM outreach programs. In this workshop, students use basic craft skills to fabricate a wearable human-computer interface out of commercially available materials. The device is interfaced with a computer via open-source hardware and software, using the universal serial bus (USB) human interface device (HID) protocol. The workshop exposes students to wearable technologies, a rapidly growing and exciting sub-domain of the electronics industry, and provides a fun and engaging hands-on activity that draws connections between fashion, technology, and personal electronics. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Global Positioning System (GPS) telemetry technology has been a boon to animal spatial ecology studies. Oftentimes, the main limitation to widespread application of this technology is the cost, which can dictate the number of individuals outfitted with GPS technology, thereby limiting sample sizes. Here, we discuss the development of a low-cost, customizable, open-source hardware GPS logger for use in animal movement studies. We also present results from field tests with Eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina) in northwestern Ohio. These GPS loggers have the potential to augment existing projects and facilitate studies that would be otherwise cost-prohibitive. © 2018

AB  - Applications involving data acquisition from sensors need samples at a preset frequency rate, the filtering out of noise and/or analysis of certain frequency components. We propose a novel software architecture based on open-software hardware platforms which allows programmers to create data streams from input channels and easily implement filters and frequency analysis objects. The performances of the different classes given in the size of memory allocated and execution time (number of clock cycles) were analyzed in the low-cost platform Arduino Genuino. In addition, 11 people took part in an experiment in which they had to implement several exercises and complete a usability test. Sampling rates under 250 Hz (typical for many biomedical applications) makes it feasible to implement filters, sliding windows and Fourier analysis, operating in real time. Participants rated software usability at 70.2 out of 100 and the ease of use when implementing several signal processing applications was rated at just over 4.4 out of 5. Participants showed their intention of using this software because it was percieved as useful and very easy to use. The performances of the library showed that it may be appropriate for implementing small biomedical real-time applications or for human movement monitoring, even in a simple open-source hardware device like Arduino Genuino. The general perception about this library is that it is easy to use and intuitive. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Microfluidic devices with integrated valves provide precise, programmable fluid handling platforms for high-throughput biological or chemical assays. However, setting up the infrastructure to control such platforms often requires specific engineering expertise or expensive commercial solutions. To address these obstacles, we present a Kit for Arduino-based Transistor Array Actuation (KATARA), an open-source and low-cost Arduino-based controller that can drive 70 solenoid valves to pneumatically actuate integrated microfluidic valves. We include a python package with a GUI to control the KATARA from a personal computer. No programming experience is required. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - Syringe pump extruders are required for a wide range of 3D printing applications, including bioprinting, embedded printing, and food printing. However, the mass of the syringe becomes a major challenge for most printing platforms, requiring compromises in speed, resolution and/or volume. To address these issues, we have designed a syringe pump large volume extruder (LVE) that is compatible with low-cost, open source 3D printers, and herein demonstrate its performance on a PrintrBot Simple Metal. Key aspects of the LVE include: (1) it is open source and compatible with open source hardware and software, making it inexpensive and widely accessible to the 3D printing community, (2) it utilizes a standard 60 mL syringe as its ink reservoir, effectively increasing print volume of the average bioprinter, (3) it is capable of retraction and high speed movements, and (4) it can print fluids using nozzle diameters as small as 100 μm, enabling the printing of complex shapes/objects when used in conjunction with the freeform reversible embedding of suspended hydrogels (FRESH) 3D printing method. Printing performance of the LVE is demonstrated by utilizing alginate as a model biomaterial ink to fabricate parametric CAD models and standard calibration objects. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Highly developed drone technology enables the use of drones in a wide variety of areas. However, those drones are mainly used in the unmanned aerial vehicles. We believe that underwater drones will become a big research topic and find a market in the near future. We developed an underwater drone with a 360° panoramic camera acting as the 'eye' of the drone. The designs are based on the open-source hardware and will be shared as an open-source for contributing to the innovation of manufacturing including drone. The function of the 360° panoramic camera is generated by correcting the images taken by two fisheye lenses. The underwater drone was designed by extending the Raspberry Pi compute module, the frame was designed by OpenSCAD, and the printed circuit board was designed by MakePro. As for the application of the underwater drone, we focused on fish recognition for investigating fish species in a natural lake to help protect the original environment. Fish recognition is based on deep learning, which is the biggest topic in the artificial intelligence research field today. Experimental results show that the function of the underwater drone achieved at diving in the leak automatically. The 360° panoramic images were generated correctly. Fish recognition achieved 87% accuracy by deep learning. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Human Machine Interface (HMI) is considered as the face of the Machine, a bridge connecting the machine to the user. HMI is the only means by which an operator can understand and utilize a device. With the technological advancements happening at an expeditious pace, even a slight change in the functioning of a device calls for a customized user interface to test the same. Adapting the Hardware-Software Co-design approach, this paper discusses and demonstrates a new design of HMI test component based on open source hardware. The purpose of the HMI Test Component is to enable the parallel development of Hardware and Software, it can help in testing the device function even without the availability of the User Interface hardware. Using Arduino as the brain of the system allows us to incorporate numerous features and implement different forms of communication. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - This paper introduces some trust issues for blockchain transactions. Such transactions rely on ECDSA signature based on 32 bytes secret keys. Because these keys can be stolen or hacked, we suggest to prevent these risks by using javacard secure elements. We detailed the interface of a Crypto Currency Smart Card (CCSC) designed over a JC3.04 standard platform. We details two use cases. First deals with deployment of the CCSC application in low cost low power object powered by an open hardware (arduino) platform, and integrates sensor data in ethereum transactions. Second proposes the deployment in the cloud of CCSC javacards plugged to RACS servers, in order to enable the remote and safe use of ECDSA signature. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Distributed digital manufacturing of free and open-source scientific hardware (FOSH) used for scientific experiments has been shown to in general reduce the costs of scientific hardware by 90–99%. In part due to these cost savings, the manufacturing of scientific equipment is beginning to move away from a central paradigm of purchasing proprietary equipment to one in which scientists themselves download open-source designs, fabricate components with digital manufacturing technology, and then assemble the equipment themselves. This trend introduces a need for new formal design procedures that designers can follow when targeting this scientific audience. This study provides five steps in the procedure, encompassing six design principles for the development of free and open-source hardware for scientific applications. A case study is provided for an open-source slide dryer that can be easily fabricated for under $20, which is more than 300 times less than some commercial alternatives. The bespoke design is parametric and easily adjusted for many applications. By designing using open-source principles and the proposed procedures, the outcome will be customizable, under control of the researcher, less expensive than commercial options, more maintainable, and will have many applications that benefit the user since the design documentation is open and freely accessible. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Slot die coating is growing in popularity because it is a low operational cost and easily scaled processing technique for depositing thin and uniform films rapidly, while minimizing material waste. The complex inner geometry of conventional slot dies require expensive machining that limits accessibility and experimentation. In order to overcome these issues this study follows an open hardware approach, which uses an open source 3-D printer to both fabricate the slot die and then to functionalize a 3-D slot die printing system. Polymer materials are tested and selected for compatibility with common solvents and used to fabricate a custom slot die head. This slot die is then integrated into a 3-D printer augmented with a syringe pump to form an additive manufacturing platform for thin film semiconductor devices. The full design of the slot die system is disclosed here using an open source license including software and operational protocols. This study demonstrates that functional lab-grade slot dies may be 3-D printed using low-cost open source hardware methods A case study using NiO 2 found an RMS value 0.486 nm, thickness of 17–49 nm, and a maximum optical transmission of 99.1%, which shows this additive manufacturing approach to slot die depositions as well of fabrication is capable of producing viable layers of advanced electronic materials. Using this method, a cost savings of over 17,000% was obtained when compared to commercial slot die systems for laboratories. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Currently, Internet of Things (IoT) technologies are used in many areas, such as intelligent transportation, smart city, hospital, games, education. Earlier interactive response system uses infrared or radio frequency (RF) wireless communication technologies to transmit the students’ answer to teachers’ managerment system, where there exists high cost, inconvenient usage, difficult deployment. How to use IoT to improve the quality of higher education becomes a very important topic in the researh area of teaching. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is one of key technologies to implement IoT applications, and most of universities use the High Frequency (HF) RFID card as the students’ identification devices in China. In this paper, a kind of WiFi supported RFID reader (WiRF) is implemented using open source hardware platforms, such as Node MCU and RFID-RC522. Then the proposed WiRF system is used to assist teacher to perform automatic attendance record and students’ behavior record. In addition, Quick Response (QR) code is another technology to enable IoT. In this paper, QR code is designed to quickly access course video and perform real-time interactive response in the classroom, which will provide multidimensional learning and strengthen the motivation of students’ learning. This IoT system can improve the attendance of students, and give a positive impact on students’ learning process for higher education. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Addressing the navigation (localization and motion control) problem of a mobile robot, coupled with its mapping problem, remains a significant challenge to date. The well-known simultaneous localization and mapping problem of mobile robots has been addressed in the literature without specifically taking into account the robot's motion control tasks. Moreover, its implementation can cost more than the robot itself. Robot motion control strategies developed in the literature either 1) rely on sophisticated hardware platforms, 2) assume noise-free environment, or 3) are based on abstract theories, which are validated using computer simulations only. The current work solves the navigation and mapping problems of mobile robots using open-source hardware and range-only measurements from a network of radio sources. The hardware platform used in this work is customized such that it is cost-effective and easy-to-implement, addressing the aforementioned issues in developing motion control strategies. The current strategy permits the robot to estimate its position and orientation and builds a map of its operating environment using radio frequency signals received from radio sources. It then navigates through a path defined by a set of two-dimensional points on the ground using a motion control strategy in cooperation with a computational intelligence tool. The proposed robot navigation and mapping scheme was tested in an indoor laboratory environment and its performance was compared with the simulation counterpart using a commercial robot simulator. © 2005-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs) are increasingly being deployed for surveillance and monitoring applications. WMSNs applications produce large amount of data, which require high transmission rates. An efficient and seamless delivery of multimedia services in WMSNs is still a challenging task. This article proposes an intelligent video surveillance platform (IVSP) for wireless multimedia sensor networks. IVSP presents the design of a networked system for joint rate control and error control of video over resource-constrained embedded devices. First, a combination of two different congestion indicators is introduced to differentiate between congestion levels and handle them accordingly. Second, a feedback-based rate controller is developed to maximize received video quality, in which sensor nodes can adaptively adjust their sending rates. Finally, a different retransmission mechanism for different packets is proposed. Lost packets can be stored temporarily and resend when free channel is available to avoid congestion. The core component of IVSP is an open source hardware platform, which is based on Raspberry Pi sensor nodes. IVSP is extensively evaluated on 7 Raspberry Pi sensor nodes. We present the results of 7-node real-world deployment of IVSP in a video surveillance application and show that it works well in long-term deployments. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - In the last few years, a demand for renewed product personalisation to satisfy the exact need of the customers has been observed in some markets. As opposed to customisation, which put emphasis on the satisfaction of explicit needs of a defined market segment, individualisation aims at satisfying the specific needs of a customer. Product design for Mass Individualisation (MI) is a new product design paradigm that comprises an open hardware platform and multiple modules that are integrated with the platform, as per end-users' choice. This paper identifies key areas and components which need to be focused to realise this approach and convert it into an industrial practice by an explorative study of existing product design and customisation approaches. A questionnaire survey has been conducted and results are presented for the industrial implication and insights on this approach. The findings clearly show that MI provides most individualised and technologically advanced product. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) has attracted many users and researchers to apply the technique for various usages. However, EMS products for research purpose are limited and open source hardware still has limitations. We present a multi-channel EMS toolkit for researchers and designers to develop their original ideas. The toolkit was designed to have isolated multiple channels to be manipulated simultaneously, which allows simultaneous control of multiple body parts and multiple users. We organized a workshop with a theme of human augmentation, where EMS was not compelled to use. As a result, several groups found interest in using EMS for their development, and participants successfully used our toolkit for their presentation. We found that multi-channel EMS has a significant demand for human augmentation purposes. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - This paper describes the architecture of a distributed digital signage system that is suitable to be deployed in a developing country setting. The design of the system, as much as possible, leverages open hardware, open source software, and open standards in order to reduce the impact from various technical, environmental, and cultural challenges that comparable deployments in developing countries have exhibited. The system comprises of three software elements: a content-management system constructed by repurposing an FTP server, a local content manager coded using a simple scripting language, and a multimedia player that utilizes an ordinary browser. The system is also made up of three major hardware nodes: a server built from a standard desktop computer, an access point procured locally, and a digital signage unit that is constructed from a standard LCD television connected to a single-board computer. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents a case study on emerging challenges within collaborative innovation projects engaging open communities. Innovation driven by open communities has proven to have a significant potential, in particular for open source software. However, tools and methodologies enabling the supervision of collaborative innovation involving open communities, in the perspective of creating open hardware to solve societal issues, remains at the early stages. This paper seeks to pinpoint the potentialities and challenges of such projects toward defining methods to better support a multi-stakeholders open source collaboration context. The experimental field of this research concerns the smart electricity distribution, and more precisely a public driven project of the diffusion of smart-meters in France and their appropriation by open source communities, with the involvement of the university and a public industrial company. The project seeks to study how these communities of users develop in a collaborative manner, new products and services using the smart-meter as a support technology. The first results show that the open community makes natural connection on specific environments such as Smart buildings to materialize usages of smart meters. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Major cloud service providers, including Amazon and Microsoft, have started employing field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to build high-performance and low-power-consumption cloud capability. However, utilizing an FPGA-enabled cloud is still challenging because of two main reasons. First, the introduction of software and hardware codesign leads to high development complexity. Second, FPGA virtualization and accelerator scheduling techniques are not fully researched for cluster deployment. In this paper, we propose an open-source FPGA-as-a-service (FaaS) platform, the hCODE, to simplify the design, management and deployment of FPGA accelerators at cluster scale. The proposed platform implements a Shell-and-IP design pattern and an open accelerator repository to reduce design and management costs of FPGA projects. Efficient FPGA virtualization and accelerator scheduling techniques are proposed to deploy accelerators on the FPGA-enabled cluster easily. With the proposed hCODE, hardware designers and accelerator users can be organized on one platform to efficiently build open-hardware ecosystem. © Copyright 2018 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.

AB  - In this study, the effect of web based power electronics courses on the success of electrical engineering candidates was examined. The participants are consisted of daytime education (30) and evening education (42) students who attended the “Power Electronics” course. First, groups were randomly assigned as experimental and control groups and experimental group and control group were examined according to the students’ GPAs, university entrance exam results, academic grades depending on 8 different lectures related with power electronics. According to the results obtained from validity and reliability of Power Electronics Course Achievement Test, the total correlation values and the standard deviation values of Power Electronics Course Achievement Test were between.301–,.598 and between.304–,.506, respectively. In addition, KR20 coefficient was found as 0.844. Before application of the “Power Electronics Course Achievement Test” there was not a significant difference in total scores of both daytime and evening education students. Although students received Web-Based Education and Web Aided Education were selected as experimental group, the students received “Traditional Education” were selected as control group. After the application, significant differences between the total grade points of both experimental and control groups of daytime education and evening education students were detected. © 2018

AB  - This paper presents an adjacent feeders search based method for service restoration of distribution systems after single faults. The developed algorithm makes a search for sections that belong to adjacent feeders and comply with two conditions: have normally open equipment installed or have a three or more derivations. As soon as the sections are selected, an exhaustive search is executed to achieve the restoration plan. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, service restoration on a typical distribution system of Taiwan Power Company is applied. The results are compared with others approaches and show that the proposed method can provide a restoration plan very efficiently even under different load levels. © 2003-2012 IEEE.

AB  - In self-powered microsystems, a power management is essential to extract, transfer and regulate power from energy harvesting sources to loads such as sensors. The challenge is to consider all of the different structures and components available and build the optimal power management on a microscale. The purpose of this paper is to streamline the design process by creating a novel reconfigurable testbed called Medlay. First, we propose a uniform interface for management functions e.g., power conversion, energy storing and power routing. This interface results in a clear layout because power and status pins are strictly separated, and inputs and outputs have fixed positions. Medlay is the ready-to-use and open-hardware platform based on the interface. It consists of a base board and small modules incorporating e.g., dc-dc converters, power switches and supercapacitors. Measurements confirm that Medlay represents a system on one circuit board, as parasitic effects of the interconnections are negligible. The versatility regarding different setups on the testbed is determined to over 250,000 combinations by layout graph grammar. Lastly, we underline the applicability by recreating three state-of-the-art systems with the testbed. In conclusion, Medlay facilitates building and testing power management in a very compact, clear and extensible fashion. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This paper deals with e-learning design and development training courses, more precisely with remote training by practical activities of laboratory experiments (E-Lab). Indeed, the majority of remote training platforms offer theoretical courses and a few practical activities, which are essential in training theoretical Science and Technology. In order to share the costly equipment, in this work, we propose an open hardware/software architecture allowing remote access to a laboratory equipment by designing in Matlab two graphical interfaces using Internet/Intranet network and TCP/IP communication protocol. A real-Time control and supervision is performed to carry out all the practical activity according to a pedagogical scenario elaborated by the trainer. The use of these interfaces is illustrated by educational sessions articulated on the Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) regulation and the Generalized Predictive Control (GPC) of temperature control system. The challenge of elaborating a remote practical activity with pedagogical effectiveness is accomplished in the above proposed solution. All the hardware and software that made available the remote experimentation platform give possibility to achieve others traditional activities in experimentation laboratory. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - This paper describes the use of various open source hardware such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, etc. to build smart and secure homes. The hardware is open source and hence cost efficient. This home automation system allows the end user to monitor his home or office with a smartphone, tablet, or any computer. This paper also explains the use of the security system for fire hazards that may occur due to a gas leakage and can be detected using a smoke sensor. It uses a low power NRF24L trans-receiver at each node around the house to create a mesh network that connects to a Linux based central hub. Users can monitor the house from anywhere and get periodic alerts. In the proposed work, the house can also be controlled using voice commands such as Google Voice, Apple HomeKit and Alexa. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Arduino and Raspberry Pi are the most popular open source hardware in the world which are invented with the hope of inspiring generation of students to learn programming and be creative. The former is a simple AVR microprocessor but powered by simple programming IDE and the complete open hardware ecosystem. The latter is a powerful ARM based mini PC but it is not very easy to get started if users has no enough programming background. To combine the advantages of both an ARM based mini PC and the complete Arduino ecosystem. LinkSprite released a powerful mini PC platform: pcDuino, which represents PC + Arduino. This paper provides a review of pcDuino technology and especially introduces the several programming methods on pcDuino. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.

AB  - This article illustrates how to evaluate platform design for an open source hardware development project. First, we will look at the open source hardware development as a methodology that fulfills demands for mass customization. In the open source hardware development, project owner offers platform sources and individual developers separately develop various functional modules based on the given platform sources. Then customers will choose each module which best meets their needs. Second, the evaluation model for the open source hardware platform will be suggested. For open source hardware development, developers' participation is one of the key factors in successful project management. Developers will consider both estimated development costs and market size to make a decision on participation. With all these concerns, we built a platform evaluation model for open source hardware projects in terms of how much it boosts the developers' participation. © 2018 International Journal of Industrial Engineering.

AB  - The open-source hardware movement is becoming increasingly popular due to the emergence of successful low-cost technologies, such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi, and thanks to the community of makers that actively share their creations to be freely studied, modified, and re-distributed. Numerous authors have proposed distinct ways to seize this approach for accomplishing a variety of learning goals: enabling scholars to explore scientific concepts, promoting students' creativity, helping them to be more fluent and expressive with new technologies, and so on. This paper reports a systematic mapping study that overviews the literature on open-source hardware in education by analyzing and classifying 676 publications. The results of our work provide: 1) guidance on the published material (identifying the most relevant papers, publication sources, institutions, and countries); 2) information about the pedagogical uses of open-source hardware (showing its main educational goals, stages, and topics where it is principally applied); and 3) directions for future research. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The boreal forest ecosystem of Alberta is increasingly affected by the human development related to natural-resource extraction, pipelines, roads and seismic lines. To evaluate the efficiency of restoration treatments, this project aims at the monitoring of physical conditions and human/wildlife presence on a recovered seismic lines ecosystem. For monitoring human and animal uses of industrial linear features, an Internet of Things (IoT) prototype system is developed with open source hardware, and open interoperable IoT standard. We try to build an accurate and cost-effective tool to detect the impact of human footprint and monitor the habit of the wild animal. So we implemented four types of trail counter which is a low-cost, open-source measurement device that counts pedestrian, bikes, all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), cars, and animals on trails, paths, and sidewalks. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

AB  - Easy-to-use and affordable means of production (e.g. 3D printer), access to these technologies (e.g. in makerspaces) and powerful tools for online product design led to the emergence of open source hardware (OSH). Like in open source software, projects and online platforms have been evolving around physical products from various technologies where people jointly develop and freely share designs. We also find businesses that sell products made from these designs and offer complimentary services. This decentralized and collaborative model of value creation offers new opportunities for social, economic and ecological sustainability, but also calls for a different understanding beyond traditional notions. Results from an exploratory study on OSH projects and companies revealed that licensing is a critical issue, communities and partners play a key role in the open source ecosystem and modes of value creation are either centered around design or production in combination with a mix of complimentary services. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.

AB  - Open Source Hardware (OSH) products are those whose design are made publicly available so that anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, and sell them. In spite of the increasing popularity of this novel approach to intellectual property in product innovation, practice communities have faced difficulties to refine this concept into sharp and practical terms. There is to date no widely acknowledged criteria for determining whether a product is open source or not. Assuming OSH follows the same development path as Open Source Software and becomes a mainstream approach, the issue of conformance will also become critical for both producers and consumers. To address this gap, this contribution introduces a self-declared product openness marking scheme allowing to rate the openness of a product. Looking forward, it provides conceptual inputs for the future establishment of technical standards bringing clarity in this emerging and moving field. © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A program library for use on open-source hardware was developed in order to construct a low-cost environmental control system for greenhouses. The library facilitated the development of environmental sensing and control devices that conform to the protocols of the Ubiquitous Environment Control System (UECS). The open-source hardware used was the “Arduino Ethernet” and the “Arduino Mega 2560 with Ethernet Shield” microcontroller boards. UECS is a system for controlling greenhouse environments that communicates information via a local area network, and devices utilizing the library that we developed can perform the UECS defined communication tasks automatically. With the help of this library, device developers no longer need to program the communications aspects of the device and can concentrate on programming setting and control logic of the device. The library occupies about 29 kilobytes of the read only memory area of the target board. The library and associated open-source microcontroller boards are powerful tools for developing low-cost environmental control systems. © 2018 Biotron Institute. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background/Objectives: The system to recreate an existing work of art into a work of convergence artworks that enables interaction with viewers utilizing the open source hardware "arduino" and electronic components was designed and implemented. Methods/Statistical analysis: The implemented work of convergence art was configured in such a way that arduino, various sensors and the actuator were connected to the existing work of art to move a part of the picture or operate output devices such as LED and speaker according to the interaction with viewers. Also, the viewers were allowed to control and appreciate the work of convergence art actively using an android device. Findings: In this study, the system to recreate an existing work of art into a work of convergence artworks that enables interaction with viewers utilizing the open source hardware "arduino" and electronic components was designed and implemented. It was possible to create a new work of art by combining electronics and communication technologies using arduino and electronic components with the existing 2D work of art that enabled the viewers to control such a work of convergence art directly using android device. Improvements/Applications: It is planned to carry out the application of the STEAM education using electronics and communication technologies in the future based on the suggested results of this study and a follow-up study to apply it to various fields of study in the future. © 2018, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

AB  - While pushing forward the boundaries of human understanding of the fundamental structure of the Universe, scientists and engineers at CERN also contributed to innovation above and beyond their immediate scientific mission by developing White Rabbit (WR): an open scientific hardware that mitigates the problem of time delays in CERN's geographically distributed network. In a context of basic research and a deliberate decision to openly share the R&D process with no IP restrictions, WR is now commercialized in a diverse range of sectors beyond the scientific industry. We follow the emergence, development, and exploitation of WR to a) identify the antecedents in which capital-intensive open source hardware differ from open source software, b) to capture the mechanisms employed by CERN to stimulate firms' R&D revelation and WR collaborative development, and c) to investigate the business model configurations that companies adopted in the commercial evolution of WR. © International Conference on Information Systems 2018, ICIS 2018.All rights reserved.

AB  - Open Source Hardware (OSH) is an increasingly viable approach to intellectual property management extending the principles of Open Source Software (OSS) to the domain of physical products. These principles support the development of products in transparent processes allowing the participation of any interested person. While increasing numbers of products have been released as OSH, little is known on the prevalence of participative development practices in this emerging field. It remains unclear to which extent the transparent and participatory processes known from software reached hardware product development. To fill this gap, this paper applies repository mining techniques to investigate the transparency and workload distribution of 105 OSH product development projects. The results highlight a certain heterogeneity of practices filling a continuum between public and private development settings. They reveal different organizational patterns with different levels of centralization and distribution. Nonetheless, they clearly indicate the expansion of the open source development model from software into the realms of physical products and provide the first large-scale empirical evidence of this recent evolution. Therewith, this article gives body to an emerging phenomenon and contributes to give it a place in the scientific debate. It delivers categories to delineate practices, techniques to investigate them in further detail as well as a large dataset of exemplary OSH projects. The discussion of first results signposts avenues for a stream of research aiming at understanding stakeholder interactions at work in new product innovation practices in order to enable institutions and industry in providing appropriate responses.

AB  - This chapter discusses the insights of my empirical research in conceptual and theoretical terms. With regard to the institutional entanglements that shape the 3D printing field and the corresponding conditions for entrepreneurial action, I emphasize the interfaces between different layers of social order. Additionally, I reconsider the essential differences between the exemplary case of open source software and the empirically observed context of open source hardware. In this regard, the matter of materiality turns out to be a crucial variable in determining the means and ends for community-based innovation. Moreover, the physical transformation of commons-based knowledge into tangible open source hardware devices like 3D printers generates multiple opportunities for entrepreneurship and thus heats up the disruptive tendencies associated with the dilemma of entrepreneurship. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.

AB  - The need for fabricating a prototype circuit arises frequently in electronics, including education and research laboratories. In resource-poor countries in the developing world, this is hindered by the high cost of commercial Printed Circuit Board (PCB) prototyping machines and long turn-around commercial fabrication process. Practical, hands-on laboratory teaching and experimentation is necessary to improve learning in electronics. In this paper, a low-cost build-your-own (BYO) semi-automated three-axis PCB milling machine for double-sided PCB prototyping is developed using commercial components and open source hardware and free open source software, to provide students, teachers, and engineers an accessible and affordable resource for PCB prototyping. Also, the main problems encountered during fabrication of PCB have been mentioned and the techniques used to solve them are discussed in detail. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Open-source hardware (OSHW), as low-cost and easy-to-use instrumentations, are particularly suited to the needs of the conservation field. This paper presents two OSHWs developed for the diagnosis of heritage metal artefacts. The DiscoveryMat application allows the qualitative analysis of slightly oxidised metals such as copper and aluminium-based alloys, through the standardized monitoring of the variation of their corrosion potential (Ecorr) with time. The Pleco allows the local identification of corrosion products through linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) plots and this contributes to a better adjustment of conservation treatments on metal artefacts covered with heterogeneous corrosion layers through the selective intervention on some corrosion products and the preservation of others. If the Pleco can already be found in the toolbox of some conservation professionals, the DiscoveryMat application is still in its infancy and needs to be developed in the future as a participatory tool. © 2018, Research Trend.

AB  - The Army continues the development of 3D printing technology to enhance the capability to produce smaller and lighter precision weaponry. Researchers and support organizations that are affiliated with the Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) are developing nano-based structures and components for advanced weaponry, aviation, and autonomous air/ground systems applications. The first key area consists of determining in-plane and out-of-plane shear properties of test articles made by 3D printing (Fused Deposition Modeling - FDM) and comparing to the conventional extrusion/forming sheet process. Test specimens are made from three polymer materials: acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), high impact poly-styrene (HIPS), and poly-lactic acid (PLA). Laboratory testing is performed according to the ASTM D3846-02 method for determining the in-plane shear strength, while the ASTM D5379 method is used for determining the out-of-plane shear properties. A description on how the 3D printing process advances the shear properties and has the potential of improving the in-plane and cross-sectional shear properties over the conventional manufacturing process is presented. The second key area demonstrates a set of materials, processes, and techniques that support the enabling of additive manufacture (AM) of RF components. Research activities are focused on developing open-source hardware/software multi-material direct digital printing, and producing 3D printed antenna, passive components, and connectors for C-band and Ku-band systems. Material studies have demonstrated a suitable material set for RF components and identified key material performance limits. Results show how more enhancement could be achieved by optimizing the variables that affect 3D printing. © 2018 SPIE.

AB  - A humanoid head robot system with some specific expression was comprehensively modelled in this paper by interactive visual expression analysis between the operator and the robot. Firstly, based on the open source hardware of Fritz humanoid head robot, an integrated emotional expression mapping model was proposed by extending the functional module of voice, vision and so on. Secondly, to achieve a natural interaction between the expression robot and the operator, the integrated visual analysis is mainly utilised for emotion calculation. Haar-like featured cascade classified algorithm is utilised for automatic face location. Gabor feature is filtered and down-sampled as the emotional expression feature. To deal with unreasonable samples distribution in traditional eigenface, an optimised eigenvectors’s selection is built by comparing projection reconstructed images with original image. Finally, the classification of with-in class PCA with energy dimension is served as expression recognition. The experimental results on JAFFE database and real-time video image demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed modelling scheme. Copyright © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Water removal is an essential step during crude oil production due to several problems such as increased transportation costs and high corrosion rate due to dissolved salts. Indirect low frequency ultrasonic energy (US), using baths, has been recently proposed as an effective alternative for crude oil demulsification. However, the reactor position during sonication and its influence on the demulsification efficiency for crude oil has not been evaluated. In this sense, the aim of this study was to develop an automated system based on an open source hardware for mapping the acoustic field distribution in an US bath operating at 35 kHz using a hydrophone. Data acquired with this system provided information to evaluate the demulsification efficiency in the different positions of the US bath and correlate it with the acoustic intensity distribution. The automated 3D-mapping system revealed a higher acoustic intensity in the regions immediately above the transducers (ca. 0.6 W cm−2), while the other regions presented a relatively lower intensity (ca. 0.1 W cm−2). Experimental data demonstrated that reactors positioned in the most intense acoustic regions provided a much higher efficiency of demulsification in comparison with the ones positioned in the less intense acoustic field regions. Demulsification efficiency up to 93% was obtained with 15 min of sonication (100% amplitude) using few amount of chemical demulsifier. Hence, this work demonstrated that the information acquired with the developed mapping system could be used for inducing a higher efficiency of demulsification only by finding the more suitable position of reactor in the US bath, which certainly will help development of appropriate reactors design when looking for such approach. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Monitoring radioelectric spectrum is a fundamental task that must be carried out for the proper use of wireless technologies in a country. It is particularly important for governments to regulate and control efficiently the use of this resource, as it is a strategic resource. The governments carry out the management of the radioelectric spectrum, but the demand for it, the increase of new wireless technologies and the misuse that certain clandestine companies make with the spectrum, require monitoring systems that are more efficient and sustained than the conventional equipment many times can not satisfy. Therefore, there are currently alternatives based on the concept of open source hardware and software that can be used to support spectrum monitoring activities using new concepts and architectures. This article presents an alternative for these measurements, which is known as software defined radio. This is a technique to build devices in which part of the hardware can be replaced by software routines, which reduces costs. The case of electromagnetic spectrum monitoring in the FM radio band in the city of Guayaquil in Ecuador is presented, using the parameters defined by the ARCOTEL local regulatory entity. © 2018 Newswood Limited.

AB  - Aeroengine simulation technology plays an important role in the development of advanced aeroengines. It can assist the engine design, shorten the development cycle, and help to reduce the research expense. Aeroengine simulation platform is widely used, especially in the field of aerospace engineering education. Digital simulation is mainly used to validate the initial test of the control algorithm, but the effectiveness of the simulation results is somewhat limited and can not be used as a final reference. As opposed to digital simulation, the traditional aeroengine hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation is a high confidence method in the control algorithm test, but it is bulky, expensive and not easy to maintain, so it is an urgent need to develop an embedded, miniaturized, and economic HIL simulation platform for the purpose of engineering education. The embedded HIL simulation platform proposed in this paper is based on two kinds of open source hardware: Raspberry Pi and Arduino. The Raspberry Pi will operate as an engine model and the Arduino board will function as the controller. They exchange data through the built-in serial ports. Efficient C codes of the aeroengine model are generated using Real-Time Workshop (RTW) tool. Numerical simulation illustrates the potential of this economical solution in university engineering education. © 2018 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

AB  - In this paper, we propose an implementation method for a 2-DOF pendulum control system that is robust against actuator uncertainties. In order to guarantee the robustness against the uncertainty of the actuator, we derive a model in which the robot body’s acceleration is the system’s control input. We then verify its validity by implementing a 2-DOF pendulum system using an omni-directional robot(ODR). The 2-DOF pendulum system can be stabilized without a mathematical model of the actuator in the proposed method. Therefore, it is possible to eliminate uncertainty in the actuator parameters. Furthermore, the method provides the advantages of flexible selection of motors used as actuators. First, we design a mechanical part to measure the angular velocity of the motor and to measure the inclination of an inverted pendulum. Second, we derive a mathematical model of a 2-DOF pendulum system for acceleration which the control input. The controller adopts the Linear Quadratic Regulator(LQR) to obtain the acceleration required for stabilization. The determined acceleration is converted to the velocity references of wheels through integration and transformation. The velocity references are followed through PI-velocity controllers. Third, the control system is implemented using the open source hardware Nucleo-32 F303K8 board. We illustrate the proposed control system’s effectiveness through stabilization experiments.

AB  - The aging level of labor force in Korea is evaluated based on the percentage of workers above the age of 50 in the economically active population. While the percentage of elderly population was 25% in 2000 it is projected that it will reach 40% in 2020 and exceed 50% in 2050. The rapid increase of elderly population is leading to the decrease of productive population. It will also cause an aggravation of domestic productivity. Productivity decline due to the increase of elderly population can become visible within a few years. Information communication technology is finding ways to respond to this problem. Smart technology can enhance productivity through automation and intellectualization in a simple and repetitive labor field. Among smart technologies, the development of IoT technology has been carried out actively. Many examples that can increase productivity using IoT have been suggested widely. This study will describe the development of IoT using open source software and hardware that can minimize the development time of IoT technology. With examples of applying IoT technology to home automation for the development of a similar system in the future, this study seeks to suggest that productivity improvement using IoT communication to solve the problems of the decrease in productive population and productivity decline. In order to show that the issue of productivity decline due to aging can be solved using open source technology, this study suggested a direction by developing home automation using open source hardware and software. © 2018, Medwell Journals.

AB  - The development and deployment of a complete photogate system (hardware + software) to be used in physics learning laboratories is described. Different approaches found in the literature are conjugated in a configuration that offers good time resolution (≈ 1 ms), high number of independent optical gates (up to six channels), high sensibility (digital-analog conversion up to 10 bits), low cost (open or free hardware and software) and easy assembly. The system was probed for three classic physics learning experiments: (i) inclined plane, (ii) viscosimeter and (iii) simple pendulum. We believe that the described tools can help to improve the learning physics laboratories autonomy and infrastructure, engaging stronger project designs with quality and versatility as good as the commercial options.

AB  - We present an open-source robotic platform for educational use that integrates multiple levels of interaction through the use of additional vision sensor. The environment can be used in virtual, augmented-reality and real-robot modes, enabling smooth transition from a virtual robot manipulator to a real one. We describe the main aspects of our platform that ensure low production costs and encourage openness of both its hardware and software. The main goal of our work was to create a viable low-cost robotic manipulator platform alternative for the university level courses in intelligent robotics, however, the application domain is very broad. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.

AB  - This paper presents an implementation of a bio-inspired aggregation scenario using swarm robots. The aggregation scenario took inspiration from honeybee’s thermotactic behaviour in finding an optimal zone in their comb. To realisation of the aggregation scenario, real and simulated robots with different population sizes were used. Mona, which is an open-source and open-hardware platform was deployed to play the honeybee’s role in this scenario. A model of Mona was also generated in Stage for simulation of aggregation scenario with large number of robots. The results of aggregation with real- and simulated-robots showed reliable aggregations and a population dependent swarm performance. Moreover, the results demonstrated a direct correlation between the results observed from the real robot and simulation experiments. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

AB  - The rapid development of Arduino open-source hardware platform-based projects has been reported for STEM education. However, it is rare to see this kind of very low-cost data acquisition (DAQ) system in science education, where it might replace expensive commercial devices. These modular, constructed DAQs can be highly customisable to meet teacher needs. In a pilot project, such devices were introduced to university students learning to become elementary school science teachers. The potential for such devices to replace currently used commercial DAQs was examined, as well as the attitude of the students to this equipment. Focus was on the Arduino-based platform, which can operate in two different modes as a standalone data-logger device or as a DAQ connected to a computer with full data visualisation. All items of equipment developed were Arduino do it yourself (DIY) devices published on the GitHub portal, where they are freely available with support and examples. © 2018 WIETE.

AB  - Free access to Earth Observations in various electromagnetic bands, the growing number of available spectral bands in imaging instruments, and the ever-better quality of corresponding products all contribute to the growing number of available applications, especially ones found in the civilian sector. On one hand, the progress made recently in the field of small satellites allows for a significant reduction in cost in both satellite design and launch, which creates numerous new opportunities for the use of small satellites in the Earth Observation field this is thus far dominated by much larger satellites. In this article, we will present an overview of the instruments that are currently used on cubesat, microsatellites and other small satellites. After conducting extensive studies, we present an analysis of the discussed instruments from the point of view of a potential microsatellite mission. This analysis is conducted based on the HyperSat microsatellite platform which is being developed by Creotech Instruments S.A. The HyperSat platform is developed in an open software and open hardware manner, which is also addressed further in this article. © 2016 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

AB  - This research explores the real-time process control of polymer flowability in Powder Bed Fusion (PBF). To do so, a novel system based on machine vision and an image-processing algorithm was developed and tested in an open hardware and software PBF system. The system has the ability to analyze the quality of the powder bed by computing a defect ratio of the powder bed after each recoating operation. Then, this ratio is used as a performance variable in three full factorial Design of Experiments (DOE). The results show that the installation of machine vision and image processing system can potentially provide a signal to repeat the recoating process and correct the defect on the powder bed. At the same time, recoating process parameters can be adjusted dynamically to guarantee an optimum quality of the powder bed and minimize possible build failures.

AB  - This chapter presents a simple new wind energy concept based on airborne rotary power generation and tensile rotary power transfer to the ground. The inexpensive prototypes use flexible inflatable wings that are arranged on ring kites, similar to how the rotor blades of a wind turbine are arranged on the hub. These autorotating rotary ring kites are stacked and integrated into a tensile structure that transfers the collected rotational power to a ground-based generator. A separate lifting kite provides additional lift to elevate the stack of rotary ring kites. Simulations and prototype testing show that network kite rigging provides the stabilizing benefits of wide tethering to networked individual kites even during fast flight for power generation. Turbulence effects are largely smoothed on individual kites. Stacked rotary ring kites can be integrated into a lattice of interconnected lifting kites, to concurrently run, at close proximity and thus allowing for greater land use efficiency. Solutions for joining the work of multiple ground stations to a single, more efficient generator are discussed. Software for kite network design is discussed. The designs are licensed as open source hardware to encourage engagement. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - This paper discussesa course in microprocessor and microcontroller system design in electrical engineering education to facilitate the student learning outcomes through hands-on projects, simulations based onlow-cost platform. This course aimed to develop design and technical skills along with communication and team management skills. A project-based learning (PBL) approach was taken into consideration. Students were asked to work on a mini design project. The main focus of the course was on laboratory, where they combined learning of microcontroller, control systems and power electronics courses.Students developed the hardware prototypes using 8051 microcontroller and they were introduced open source hardware like arduinoand also encouraged to work on such platform which enabled them to undertake a range of design activities. The students with same wave length came together to form groups. The groups were given a time span of a semester to complete their undertaken project task. Evaluation of this course was obtained from students, staff, and an external examiner, and the results show that the PBLachieved its educational objectives. © 2018, Rajarambapu Institute Of Technology.

AB  - Road traffic and its impacts affect various aspects of wellbeing with safety, congestion and pollution being of significant concern in cities. Although there have been a large number of works done in the field of traffic data collection, there are several barriers which restrict the collection of traffic data at higher resolution in the cities. Installation and maintenance costs can act as a disincentive to use existing methods (e.g., loop detectors, video analysis) at a large scale and hence limit their deployment to only a few roads of the city. This paper presents an approach for vehicle counting using a low cost, simple and easily installable system. In the proposed system, vehicles (i.e., bicycles, cars, trucks) are counted by means of variations in the WiFi signals. Experiments with the developed hardware in two different scenarios—low traffic (i.e., 400 objects) and heavy traffic roads (i.e., 1000 objects)—demonstrate its ability to detect cars and trucks. The system can be used to provide estimates of vehicle numbers for streets not covered by official traffic monitoring techniques in future smart cities. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - This work presents an efficient approach to describe enhanced detailed mechanical behaviour of MEMS elements equivalent to a complex distributed spring mass system, which also contains weak nonlinearities on its eigenmodes. Based on an reduced order state space description of its FE mesh model the dynamic behaviour including higher eigenmodes can be simulated on system level. The core of this paper addresses the superposition of the state space model with additional suited fractional differential equations to describe stiffness variations and nonlinear behaviour in more realistic test scenarios. The discussed models are implemented in SystemC AMS – this open hardware description standard provides well suited capabilities for multi-physical domain simulations. © VDE VERLAG GMBH ∙ Berlin ∙ Offenbach

AB  - This paper discusses how emerging issues in housing construction could revolutionise the building industry. It focuses on commons-based networks of organisations, technologies and users that form a niche practice on the margins of the dominant paradigm. This practice can be understood as "Design Global, Manufacture Local" and is exemplified by the Hexayurt, the Open Source Ecology Microhouse and the WikiHouse. Using these descriptive case studies, light is shed on the challenges and opportunities of open construction systems with regard to technological, institutional and social perspectives. Notwithstanding the positive dynamics, certain issues need to be addressed, so that a sustainable built environment could flourish. © 2018, Tamkang University.

AB  - Radar is an electronic device which utilizes electromagnetic waves to determine the altitude, range, direction, or speed of both moving and immovable objects. In contrast, ultrasonic waves are used instead of electromagnetic waves in ultrasonic radar. The low power consumption, low cost and ease of implementation are considered the main features of the ultrasonic radar to be devoted in several applications such as security purposes, object detection and avoidance systems in robotics. This work presents a design and implementation of ultrasonic radar for distance measurements. The design consists of an ultrasonic sensor, an Arduino board as a controller, a servo motor and a java application. The detection range of the proposed system is tested up to 500 cm with the angle of rotation from (0 to +180) and (180 to 0) degrees for different types of obstacles or objects (sponge, wood an aluminum). The design is built using open source hardware (Arduino Uno 328) which is coded via Micro C environment as a software entity. The effectiveness of the proposed design is measured using a statistical analysis of the distance error between the radar and the obstacles. The results obtained for all types of obstacles are tabled and graphed to prove that a very small error can be achieved using the proposed design. © 2018 Haraa Raheem Hatem et. al.

AB  - Currently, 360-degree panoramic images are widely used in the various area and has attracted more attention with the increased support of panoramic movies by Youtube and Facebook. At the same time, the increasing of opensource hardware gives a large contribution for innovation of manufacturing. We challenge to develop an underwater drone which equips fisheye lens for taking the panoramic images and uses an algorithm to generate 360-degree panoramic images. This paper guides to develop an opensourced 360-degree panoramic image generation, and the generation equipped underwater-drone which is extended on a Raspberry Pi computer module. The frame is designed by OpenSCAD, the printed board is designed by MakePro. For realizing the 360-degree panoramic images, the underwater-drone equips two 235-degree fisheye lenses and uses the OpenGL ES2 to for correcting the fisheye images. The goal of this research is using the underwater-drone to investigate the lake, sea and so on. Now, we are trying to investigate the species fishes in the natural lake for helping to protect the original environment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We present a transmitter circuit to drive a commercial Light Emitting Diode (LED)-based headlight for automotive Visible Light Communication (VLC). Based on the design of the presented transmitter (TX), we provide a design methodology for VLC TXs and make it available as Open Hardware. Furthermore, a complete wireless VLC link is built using the GNU Radio signal processing tool chain and demonstrated on an Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP). The Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of the system is below 5% for a wide input voltage range and the 1 dB compression point (P1dB) is at 1.02V, which makes the circuit attractive for more advanced modulation formates like Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) or Pulse-Amplitude Modulation (PAM). © VDE VERLAG GMBH ∙ Berlin ∙ Offenbach

AB  - The Cleopatra work package of the ASTERICS project aims to address the common challenge of time and frequency distribution in distributed instruments and multi-messenger astronomy. We have made improvements to the open hardware’White Rabbit’ time and frequency distribution system to achieve better reach, stability and phase noise. Moreover, we are able to use White Rabbit over public fiber, co-existing with other traffic on different wavelengths. To demonstrate the achieved performance, we are conducting VLBI observations using the venerable Dwingeloo telescope, which will soon be connected to the hydrogen maser reference from the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, transported over 165 km of fiber in the SURFnet network. Using off-the-shelf software-defined-radio hardware, and the open-source GNU Radio program, we have recently achieved our first fringes between Westerbork, Jodrell Bank and Dwingeloo. © Copyright owned by the author(s) under the terms of the Creative Commons.

AB  - This chapter connects directly to the current state of research on innovation communities and discusses their institutional foundations, their implementation in the context of fields, as well as their practical implications in terms of agency and entrepreneurship. Against this background, I attempt to grasp innovation communities as a distinct type of meso-level order. Here, the general conflicts that shape the institutional foundations of collective innovation play out in the context of gradually settled fields, where community and business logics compete over the legitimate ways to shape the particular innovation at stake. Consequently, the resulting fields reflect an ambiguous institutional environment that affects not only the general conditions under which innovation communities create and develop potentially innovative artifacts (like 3D printers), but also the particular opportunities and struggles that accompany corresponding approaches for commercial exploitation. As the dilemma of entrepreneurship in open hardware usually refers to community members that develop entrepreneurial ambitions to commercialize community-based innovations, Chap. 3 also emphasizes the micro level of individual actors and their agentic capacities to relieve tensions within a complex and potentially contradictive institutional environment. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.

AB  - Applying the capabilities of the Internet of Things holds particular promise for advancing certain of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. For instance, citizens in many developing countries lack access to energy, and suffer from a lack of energy independence, scarcity, and high energy costs. Efforts are underway to make energy generation, transmission, and consumption more efficient via the application of modern communications and control. In this paper we focus on a communications and demand-side control application for legacy appliances. Instead of replacing existing devices with new “smart” devices with better communications capability, we integrate legacy devices into a centralized control system. We designed and implemented a communications system that allows control of infrared-enabled appliances over a network using wired or wireless communications. We designed a web application and user interface that can function remotely over the Internet, and use microcontrollers and infrared transmitters to communicate with infrared-enabled devices. We demonstrate a prototype of the system to control air conditioning units in a commercial building for energy management. The system uses open source hardware, software, and protocols. While we use energy management as an example, we focus on the general communications and control architecture, which is easily scalable and applicable to other devices and applications beyond those demonstrated here. © 2018, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.

AB  - Sharing documentation is part of many good practices that engage participants on a long-term base. Well-known are the professional fields of Open Source Software, Open Hardware and Open Innovation, as well as academic research. At its core, documentation is about transferring information beyond one specific project team, site or time frame. We specifically explore Participatory Design projects, wherein this type of information exchange remains a challenge for many researchers. From a literature study about how to support making documentation in Open Source Software and Hardware practices, we learn how to elicit skill building and intrinsic motivation. We complement these insights with two Participatory Design practices that already use a form of documentation, i.e. design games and sensitizing. We distinguish five characteristics that designers can use to implement documentation in the design process by balancing between skill building and intrinsic motivation, and propose the concept of ‘documentation games’ as a format supporting this. We exemplify this approach through three case studies and assess how the five characteristics and the documentation games provide handholds to include documentation to support long-term engagements in participatory design processes. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Oswald Devisch, Liesbeth Huybrechts, Roel De Ridder.

AB  - The ever-increasing flood of information, especially in the medical-clinical field, inter alia due to the increase of data-intensive mobile/wearable devices, is one of the biggest challenges of medical informatics. In this work different possibilities of the integration of wearable devices on the example of the development of a fall prevention system are presented and classified. We started with a commercial off-the-shelf one-on-one system (Shimmer/Arduino) using a Bluetooth connection, integrated via nurse call system as Human-Machine-Interface. During the evaluation of the system we mentioned several new requirements and optimization possibilities. Thus, we adjusted the hardware-software-system; the near-field communication was realized by IEEE802.15.4, we replaced commercial off-the-shelf devices with highly-specialized open hardware in-house developments and we transferred the nurse call integration by setting up our own network and integrating this into an existing (wireless) local area network. With this development, the energy-efficient, simple and intuitive mechanisms of proximity communication via IEEE802.15.4 can be combined with the benefits broadband functionalities, e.g. of Wi-Fi, with both worlds benefits and the compensation of some disadvantages. © 2018 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - Thermal Pyranometers are very important devices for evaluating the intensity of solar radiation under different climatic conditions. These devices utilize thermal radiation for comparison and determination of their efficiency. Because of this wide use associated with the development of new technologies, a simple and low-cost version of thermal pyranometer has been studied, designed and manufactured. A blackened aluminum disk is used as a hot junction, and the cold junction is exposed to ambient air. The two terminals are connected to a digital amplifier with output signal directed to an Arduino board. A device calibration was performed by comparing the results with a commercial photodiode sensor. Statistical analysis of the calibration data considering a 99% confidence level leads to an estimated standard error of 20.8 W/m2. An analysis of its response time also estimated from a dynamic model. This model uses a numerical solution of the energy balance on heat exchange between the aluminum disc and the environment. The instrument response time based on the average of the estimates obtained from the dynamic model is about 1.5 minutes. Based on these studies it was concluded that the characteristics of the sensor are adequate for most solar energy tests and the final cost of US $ 60.00 is much lower than the large majority of such commercial devices. © 2018 International Journal of Thermodynamics.

AB  - This work presents the design, modeling, and implementation of a neural network inverse model controller for tracking the maximum power point of a photovoltaic (PV) module. A nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX) was implemented in a serial-parallel architecture. The PV module mathematical modeling was developed, a buck converter was designed to operate in the continuous conduction mode with a switching frequency of 20 KHz, and the dynamic neural controller was designed using the Neural Network Toolbox from Matlab/Simulink (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA), and it was implemented on an open-hardware Arduino Mega board. To obtain the reference signals for the NARX and determine the 65 W PV module behavior, a system made of a 0.8WPV cell, a temperature sensor, a voltage sensor and a static neural network, was used. To evaluate performance a comparison with the P&O traditional algorithm was done in terms of response time and oscillations around the operating point. Simulation results demonstrated the superiority of neural controller over the P&O. Implementation results showed that approximately the same power is obtained with both controllers, but the P&O controller presents oscillations between 7 W and 10W, in contrast to the inverse controller, which had oscillations between 1 W and 2 W. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Modern ultrasonic phased-array controllers are electronic systems capable of delaying the transmitted or received signals of multiple transducers. Configurable transmit-receive array systems, capable of electronic steering and shaping of the beam in near real-time, are available commercially, for example, for medical imaging. However, emerging applications, such as ultrasonic haptics, parametric audio, or ultrasonic levitation, require only a small subset of the capabilities provided by the existing controllers. To meet this need, we present Ultraino, a modular, inexpensive, and open platform that provides hardware, software, and example applications specifically aimed at controlling the transmission of narrowband airborne ultrasound. Our system is composed of software, driver boards, and arrays that enable users to quickly and efficiently perform research in various emerging applications. The software can be used to define array geometries, simulate the acoustic field in real time, and control the connected driver boards. The driver board design is based on an Arduino Mega and can control 64 channels with a square wave of up to 17 Vpp and π/5 phase resolution. Multiple boards can be chained together to increase the number of channels. The 40-kHz arrays with flat and spherical geometries are demonstrated for parametric audio generation, acoustic levitation, and haptic feedback. © 1986-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Different scientific communities face the challenge of the so called reproducibility crisis. In engineering and geotechnical engineering in particular this is not discussed in detail. However, research in soil mechanics is often done with highly specialized and expensive equipment. This research can not repeated or the testing methodology is seldom applied with a different soil type due to the availability of the testing protocol and equipment. Nowadays, the increasing accessibility of 3-D printing facilities, single-board computer and micro-controllers lead to new opportunities and ways to overcome this challenges. The aim of this contribution is to shed some light on this facts and discuss opportunities to improve the scientific situation with respect of open science in soil mechanics. To the authors best knowledge this is a novel application of Open Science in geotechnical engineering. The developed device is called Open Science interface shear device (OSInterface), which will act as a pilot project to demonstrate the opportunities using methods that are applied for example for open source software development in open hardware development with a focus to geotechnical engineering. Basically, this interface shear device differs not much from existing shear devices but the development and the construction is accessible to everyone. The different aspects of such a development based on the OSInterface are discussed and also the challenges are addressed. The idea is to motivate many different researchers to rebuild the OSinterface device and share their own developments. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Earthquake effects are strongly related with the properties of the local geology, amplifying the ground motion, especially in soft soils. This amplification is connected with the resonant frequency, which can be estimated applying the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (H/V) method on seismic noise measurements. In this work, a low-cost user-friendly data acquisition system (Geophonino-3D) has been designed for three-component seismic noise recording. The developed system consists of the signal conditioning circuit and the Arduino Due with an SD Shield for data storage. The suitability of the equipment for the application of the H/V method has been first assessed in the laboratory, according to the experimental sensitivity, the internal noise stability and the channel consistency. Subsequently, experimental verification has been carried out by recording seismic noise at eight different sites along the province of Alicante (southeast Spain), with different soil characteristics. The performance of the developed acquisition system has been evaluated in terms of the power spectral density and the H/V peaks by comparison with the results obtained through a commercial seismic recorder. The obtained results show the applicability of the developed acquisition system to record seismic noise and to apply the H/V method. Geophonino-3D is an open source and open hardware system and the price of its components is much lower than any other commercial equipment, which becomes a significant advance especially for small research groups with reduced economic support. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Purpose: Vertical jump tests are used to assess lower-limb power of athletes in sport sciences. Flight time measurement with jump-mat systems is the most common procedure for this purpose. The aim of this study was to analyze the concurrent validity and reliability of two proprietary systems (Globus and Axon) and an open-source system (Chronojump). Methods: A conditioning electric circuit governed by a controlled wave generator is designed to substitute athletes jumping on a physical mat. In order to look for possible differences associated to timekeeping by each microcontroller device, all three systems are fed by the circuit simultaneously. Results: Concurrent validity was high for the three systems. Standarized typical error of estimate (TEE) was trivial, according to MBI interpretation as well as perfect Pearson correlation coefficient. Reliability was assessed based on the coefficient of variation of flight time measure, resulting in 0.17–0.63% (0.05–0.12 cm) for Globus, 0.01% (0.09 cm) for Chronojump and 5.65–9.38% (2.15–3.53 cm) for Axon. These results show that all jump-mat system produced nearly identical measures of flight time so they can be considered valid and reliable for practical purposes. In comparison, Chronojump showed the best performance whereas Axon showed enough variability and disagreement to pose a problem in testing elite athletes. Conclusions: These experiments show that open-source jump mats are as valid and reliable as their proprietary counterparts at a lower cost. Therefore, practitioners can be confident in using Globus or Chronojump systems to test athletes’ jump height because of their negligible errors and Axon system to monitor general population. © 2018, Institute of Machine Design and Operation.

AB  - Any hydrological model starts with collecting relevant hydrometeorological data to run the model. Despite the importance of hydrological models for water resource management and disaster risk reduction, the adequacy of the hydrometeorological stations and their locations play a significant role in generating reliable model outputs. Although World Meteorological Organization (WMO) recommends minimum station densities for different physiographic areas with some detailed standards on siting and calibrating the instruments used in the stations, it doesn't provide any guideline to select optimum locations to deploy the stations. The adequacy of the stations vary with the weather condition of the area and the measured parameters. Since some of the most widely used parameters in hydrological modelling, such as precipitation can vary greatly with small distances, in reality, the required density is higher than the recommended density by the WMO. This research was conducted in a period where the University of Moratuwa of Sri Lanka is conducting a research project called 4ONSE (4 times Open and Non-Conventional technology for Sensing the Environment) in collaboration with University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland. The project involves deploying low cost, open technologies (open hardware, software, data and standards) based hydrometeorological stations in Deduru Oya river basin of Sri Lanka. The process of determining the optimum locations for the stations started with discretizing the watershed into sub-basins. Satellite retrieved weather data was applied in Shannon's Entropy method to measure the spatial distribution of uncertainty levels of precipitation. In addition, requirements of the hydrological modeling software (SWAT) and several other factors were considered in determining the number and the locations for the stations. The method presented in this research is an experimental approach of deploying the 4ONSE stations in real world. © 2018 Proceedings - 39th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing: Remote Sensing Enabling Prosperity, ACRS 2018

AB  - Open platform architecture products (OPAP) are the key enablers for Product design for Mass Individualisation. It is a new product design paradigm that comprises an open hardware platform, mass-produced by large manufacturers and multiple independent modules, invented and produced by other smaller companies and by the end-user that are integrated with the platform. It gives freedom to end-users to integrate different modules into the platform as per their choice. This type of product integration will be engaged with by the all actors involved in the design and aims to help them to be more creative and innovative. The end product will be highly individualised and technologically advanced. Based on explorative literature analysis, with practical insights from an industrial questionnaire survey, an Innovation toolkit for the end-user has been developed. The Innovation toolkit provides a mean of selecting an optimal module option for each module which will be integrated on the hardware platform. The design of the Innovation toolkit for OPAP has been approached in three different steps: Modelling of OPAP, Modelling of evaluation measures and evaluation indices with end-user preferences and Identification of the optimal module options. In this work, variations in module options for a given module are modelled by an AND-OR tree and parameters of the nodes in this tree. Different module options for the selected module are evaluated by various evaluation measures. These evaluation measures are converted into comparable customer satisfaction indices. The optimal OPAP is identified by constrained optimisation of the overall customer satisfaction index. Two case studies have been presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the introduced Innovation toolkit. These case studies illustrate that the Innovation toolkit can readily be applied to these types of product development to obtain a highly individualised OPAP with optimised module options. © Proceedings of NordDesign: Design in the Era of Digitalization, NordDesign 2018.

AB  - In the last years the popularity and with that performance of COTS single-board computers and systems-on-a-chip (SoC) with partially open designs and software systems like the Raspberry Pi, Arduino, or BeagleBoard raised significantly. Thanks to their wide availability, low price, and open adaptability they are widely used in broad communities among makers and artists as well as in schools and universities. They can serve as scientific platforms e.g. as interfaces, sensor data handling or distributed computing platforms. Due to the large spread and user number, as well as the accessibility of the design, bugs are likely to be found and patched, leaving a reliable system. A variety of open source operating systems and programs with a multitude of easy to use libraries decreases the complexity in the development of new soft- and hardware. This offers the great opportunity even in space business to use them as an engineering model, to build laboratory breadboards, or as an experimental platform. Beside the evolution of the boards also the requirements for on-board computers and payload data handling units have increased considerably, even on very small satellites. Computers like the Raspberry Pi or BeagleBone are able to increase computational power and at the same time decreasing size, mass, complexity, and power consumption. They are very well suited for tasks such as image processing, handling of large data, or operation in general. When being able to use them as flight model directly development time and system adaptations can be decreased to a minimum. We tested both Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone modules. This paper focuses on the characterization and total ionizing dose (TID) test of the smallest board in the BeagleBone family, the PocketBeagle. The PocketBeagle has a footprint comparable to a matchbox and hosts an 1 GHz ARM processor with 512 MB RAM and integrated power management. Besides the ARM-SoC the PocketBeagle only hosts a SD-card memory slot and a USB interface. We will describe the test setup, parameters, and routines during the test campaign. Further we will present the characterization and discuss the performance during and after the TID test. The TID of this test was equivalent to a 2-years mission in LEO. The SoC on the PocketBeagle passed the tests. This paper is a step towards trusting and using open source technology and COTS systems in space. Copyright © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Future exploration missions in space between the Earth and the Moon or beyond will require complex operational activities to ensure that crew, cargo, and exploration systems reach their destination safely and successfully. NASA is committed to engaging citizen scientists with opportunities to develop novel solutions that can assist in bridging technology gaps related to human spaceflight. Four years ago, NASA entered into a Space Act Agreement with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Foundation to inspire students with real-world engineering problems through a series of engineering challenges that leverage the 3D Printing in Zero-G Technology Demonstration aboard the International Space Station (ISS). With technical assistance from NASA, ASME designs and conducts K-12 engineering design challenges using the Future Engineers challenge platform allowing participants to use their imaginations and 3D modeling software to design items related to future space exploration missions. The Future Engineers web presence hosts challenges, provides links to free modeling software, and features an open hardware design repository showcasing student software models. At the end of each challenge, a committee that includes NASA personnel and experts on 3D printing in space, reviews all submissions and selects several designs for final review. Finalists are then interviewed by a judging panel with winners selected in Junior (ages 5-12) and Teen (ages 13-19) age divisions. Through this innovative collaboration, winners have received behind-the-scenes tours of NASA, SpaceX, Bigelow Aerospace, Digital Domain, and MakerBot, and had their designs printed on the 3D printer aboard the ISS. Since 2014, the challenges have successfully engaged over 2,700 students from 46 states to use their imaginations to design and create 3D engineering models related to items astronauts may need in the future. Thirty-nine percent of participants are female, a traditionally underrepresented group in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) careers. This paper provides an overview of received submissions, winning designs, success stories, and lessons learned. It will also detail the relationship, the unique assets of each organization, and the roles of each in implementing the challenges. We share details on the management, promotion, summative information about participants, and next steps for the effort. The projects resulting from these Future Engineers challenges have greatly surpassed expectations, increased NASA's body of knowledge in In-Space Manufacturing, and inspired and engaged the next generation of space explorers.

AB  - Distributed manufacturing, where decentralized small, local sites are engaged in production, often supported by digital systems and networks, can be a powerful tool in humanitarian aid. Field Ready uses distributed manufacturing to produce essential non-food items locally where they are needed during humanitarian responses. Such supplies can be available to communities in need and to relief workers more quickly, more cheaply than alternatives, and provide appropriate solutions to problems, often engaging local people in designing and making necessary items, and supporting economic development. Scaling up this requires local production capabilities (skills, tools, and information such as designs), which can be boosted by adoption of these methods by aid agencies, international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) and others. Local manufacturing offers the potential for disaster affected communities to be engaged in recovery, and long term to become more resilient, with access to all the equipment and information required to make the supplies they need. However, there are challenges: appropriate quality control for distributed manufacture, unlocking the potential for in-region manufacturers to engage in humanitarian response, and uptake of digital knowledge sharing and collaboration to the humanitarian sector. In this paper, we share experiences of human-centred design and global collaboration to solve local problems, of manufacturing in remote and challenging locations, community building and bridging sectors through the Humanitarian Makers network, and new ideas for distributed manufacturing standards and quality. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Soil and nutrient depletion from intensive use of land is a critical issue for food production. An understanding of whether the soil is adequately treated with appropriate crop management practices in real-time during production cycles could prevent soil erosion and the overuse of natural or artificial resources to keep the soil healthy and suitable for planting. Precision agriculture traditionally uses expensive techniques to monitor the health of soil and crops including images from satellites and airplanes. Recently there are several studies using drones and a multitude of sensors connected to farm machinery to observe and measure the health of soil and crops during planting and harvesting. This paper describes a real-time, in-situ agricultural internet of things (IoT) device designed to monitor the state of the soil and the environment. This device was designed to be compatible with open hardware and it is composed of temperature and humidity sensors (soil and environment), electrical conductivity of the soil and luminosity, Global Positioning System (GPS) and a ZigBee radio for data communication. The field trial involved soil testing and measurements of the local climate in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The measurements of soil temperature, humidity and conductivity are used to monitor soil conditions. The local climate data could be used to support decisions about irrigation and other activities related to crop health. On-going research includes methods to reduce the consumption of energy and increase the number of sensors. Future applications include the use of the IoT device to detect fire in crops, a common problem in sugar cane crops and the integration of the IoT device with irrigation management systems to improve water usage. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - The concept of quality of life is used as a measure of the welfare of a society, highlighting the relationship between the environment and health, mainly associated with pollution. Hence the importance of monitoring and communicating its results, in a timely manner, to the community. But often the last part of the process fail, there is a lack of communication between data, information and community. Using open hardware and open source tools, and based on the Internet of things concept, a low-cost citizen monitoring network, that cost less than US $ 150 was implemented. This network measures Carbon Monoxide (CO), Temperature, Relative Humidity, Particulate Matter 2.5, Noise and UV radiation, with a reading frequency of every 40 s and a hibernation period of 15 min. The environmental monitoring network gather information from the environment, through sensors, and then store it in a MySQL database, to finally be deployed in a web site hosted on a local web server Apache, implemented ex professo.

AB  - Traditionally unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs) have been large, complex and expensive. Development of UUVs has been driven by defense and commercial requirements. This has allowed for extensive research and development budgets and long development cycles. This paper briefly discuses these historic drivers and how this situation has changed. It focuses on a new compact affordable UUV. In 2015, several veterans of the conventional UUV sector set out to change the dynamics of the industry, founding Riptide Autonomous Solutions. Riptide's first offering was the micro-UUV, a new, highly flexible, open source autonomous undersea vehicle. The micro-UUV features open hardware and software interfaces giving users a reliable and robust platform to advance technology development. The vehicle design is optimized for high efficiency with the best hydrodynamic signature in its class. The base micro-UUV is 4 7/8 inches in diameter, 40 inches in length and weighs 22 lbs. The standard system is rated to a depth of 300 meters. This paper discuses the technical details of this UUV that make it distinctive and enabled its rapid development. The entire system was taken from design to initial delivery in under 12 months. Flexible and open software interfaces and use of modern three - dimensional design and printing are key enablers of the rapid development. A highly optimized hydrodynamic design improves the speed and endurance of the vehicle, as does its compact size. Reducing control fins from the typical four to three reduces drag and enables active roll control steering, a further enhancement of the micro-UUV's performance. In addition to describing the novel features and approach of the micro-UUV design this paper will discuss the potential for a new aluminum seawater battery to extend the range of this compact vehicle to nearly 1000km. © 2017 Marine Technology Society.

AB  - Weather stations are a valuable tool to many different areas, like agriculture, aviation, construction, sports and recreation, specially because they collect weather data, which can be stored and processed to gather specific information to correlate events to the weather action. This work shows a development model of a low cost weather station, using only free hardware and software, connected to the internet, giving real time data taken from the station, as well as history of the stored data. This station, even though using low cost or handcrafted sensors, like those that measure wind speed, wind direction and rainfall index, showed consistent results costing only 10% of the price, in comparison with some professional weather stations, allowing its popularization in agriculture, homes and institutions. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Robotics has been used to draw the attention of young students to computing and engineering. Unfortunately, most hardware and software resources used to teach programming and robotics are not adequate for students with visual impairment (VI). For instance, most programming environments for young students are highly visual and the commercial robotics kits were not built for people with VI. This paper describes the main design requirements so that both the proposed robot hardware and the software can also be used by people with VI. The hardware part is the focus of this paper, a robot called Donnie. It consists of open hardware, a design with low-cost and easy to find parts, and a 3D printed structure. Our main contribution is the presentation of a low-cost Arduino-based robot, compatible with Player robotic framework and integrated with sound feedback and text-to-speech. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents the Pi-puck extension board - an interface between the e-puck robot platform and a Raspberry Pi single-board computer that enhances the processing power, memory capacity, and networking capabilities of the robot at a low cost. It allows high-level control algorithms, wireless communication, and computationally expensive operations such as real-time image processing to be handled by a Raspberry Pi, while the e-puck's microcontroller deals with low-level motor control and sensor interfacing. Although two similar extension boards for the e-puck robot platform already exist, they are now out-dated and expensive in comparison. Our open-source hardware design and supporting software infrastructure offer an inexpensive upgrade to the e-puck robot, transforming it into the Pi-puck - a modern and flexible new platform for mobile robotics research. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Enabled by modern languages and retargetable compilers, software development is in a virtual 'Cambrian explosion' driven by a critical mass of powerfully parameterized libraries; but hardware development practices lag far behind. We hypothesize that existing hardware construction languages (HCLs) and novel hardware compiler frameworks (HCFs) can put hardware development on a similar evolutionary path by enabling new hardware libraries to be independent of underlying process technologies including FPGA mappings. We support this claim by (1) evaluating the degree with which Chisel, an existing HCL, can support powerfully parameterized libraries, and (2) introducing the concept and implementation of an HCF that uses an open-source hardware intermediate representation, FIRRTL (Flexible Intermediate Representation for RTL), to transform target-independent RTL into technology-specific RTL. Finally, we evaluate many hardware compiler transformations, including simplifying transformations, analyses, optimizations, instrumentations, and specializations, which demonstrate the power of a combined HCL and HCF approach. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Since the demand for more bandwidth, agile infrastructures and services grows, it becomes challenging for Service Providers like GÉANT to manage the proprietary underlay, while keeping costs low. In such a scenario, Software Defined Networking (SDN), open hardware and open source software prove to be key components to address those challenges. After one year of development, SDX-L2 and BoD, the SDN-ization of the GÉANT Open and Bandwidth on Demand (BoD) services, have been brought to the pilot status and GÉANT is now testing the outcomes on its operational network. In this demonstration, we show BoD and SDX-L2”going live” at the GÉANT production infrastructure. The pilots run on the same underlay infrastructure thanks to the virtualization capabilities of the network devices. Provisioning of the services is covered during the demo. In the final steps of the demonstration, we show how the infrastructure is able to automatically manage network events and how it remains operational in the case of fault events. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - The importance of quality of the measured values is very dependent on the device that measures these values: the size of the sample, the time of measurement, periods of measurement, the mobility and the robustness of the device, etc. Contemporary devices intended for the measurement of physical quantities that are on the market vary in price, as well as and the quality of the measured values. The rule "the more expensive the better" is not necessarily always a rule that is valid because it all depends on the characteristics and capabilities of the device, and the customer's needs. In this paper, a device based on "Open Source" components of hardware and software will be presented. Device was used to measure voltages and currents on low voltage networks, on which a virtually unlimited number of sensors can be added, and the device is assembled of components available on electronic components Internet.

AB  - Excluding the ion source, an ion mobility spectrometer is fundamentally comprised of drift chamber, ion gate, pulsing electronics, and a mechanism for amplifying and recording ion signals. Historically, the solutions to each of these challenges have been custom and rarely replicated exactly. For the IMS research community few detailed resources exist that explicitly detail the construction and operation of ion mobility systems. In an effort to address this knowledge gap we outline a solution to one of the key aspects of a drift tube ion mobility system, the ion gate pulser. Bradbury-Nielsen or Tyndall ion gates are found in nearly every research-grade and commercial IMS system. While conceptually simple, these gate structures often require custom, high-voltage, floating electronics. In this report we detail the operation and performance characteristics of a wifi-enabled, MOSFET-based pulser design that uses a lithium-polymer battery and does not require high voltage isolation transformers. Currently, each output of this circuit follows a TTL signal with ~20 ns rise and fall times, pulses up to +/− 200 V, and is entirely isolated using fiber optics. Detailed schematics and source code are provided to enable continued use of robust pulsing electronics that ease experimental efforts for future comparison. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - The ability to reliably and precisely deliver picolitre volumes is an important component of biological research. Here we describe a high-performance, low-cost, open hardware pressure ejection system (Openspritzer), which can be constructed from off the shelf components. The device is capable of delivering minute doses of reagents to a wide range of biological and chemical systems. In this work, we characterise the performance of the device and compare it to a popular commercial system using two-photon fluorescence microscopy. We found that Openspritzer provides the same level of control over delivered reagent dose as the commercial system. Next, we demonstrate the utility of Openspritzer in a series of standard neurobiological applications. First, we used Openspritzer to deliver precise amounts of reagents to hippocampal neurons to elicit time- and dose-precise responses on neuronal voltage. Second, we used Openspritzer to deliver infectious viral and bacterial agents to living tissue. This included viral transfection of hippocampal interneurons with channelrhodopsin for the optogenetic manipulation of hippocampal circuitry with light. We anticipate that due to its high performance and low cost Openspritzer will be of interest to a broad range of researchers working in the life and physical sciences. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - In this paper a new open-source and open-hardware framework for Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) control is described. The hardware is based on CIAA (Computadora Industrial Abierta Argentina) and Arduino modules while the software is based on NuttX real-Time operating system (RTOS). For communication, the MAVlink protocol is used, also enabling interfacing with ROS (Robot Operating System). The framework can be employed for different style UGVs (differential drive, omnidirectional, skid steer) with different number of motorized wheels. It is designed for low-cost and ease of integration and adoption. The proposed framework was employed as the control system of a four-wheel skid-steer rover protoype developed by the authors, which is also described as a part of this work. © 2017 ACSE.

AB  - Active chlorophyll a fluorescence is an essential tool for understanding photosynthetic activity within cnidarian/dinoflagellate symbioses. Fluorescence measurement is typically achieved by utilizing a blue or red monochromatic excitation light source. However, algal photosynthetic pigments can differ in their absorption spectra, potentially leading to excitation wavelength dependent measurements of maximal and light acclimated PSII photosynthetic quantum yield (Fv/Fm or Fq'/Fm') and functional absorption cross section (σPSII or σPSII'). Here we utilized an open source hardware development platform to construct a multispectral excitation fluorometer to assess spectrally dependent differences in photochemistry within four different Symbiodinium species (two of each ITS2-type A4 and B1). Multivariate analysis of light acclimated photochemical signatures showed separation between most alga types. These spectrally dependent differences in light acclimated PSII efficiency and PSII functional absorption cross section likely reflect changes in light harvesting compounds, their connectivity to the PSII reaction centers and the balance between photochemical and non-photochemical fluorescence quenching. Additionally, acclimation to low (20 μmol photons m-2s-1) and high (200 μmol photons m-2 s-1) light conditions was examined in two of these symbionts types (ITS-2 type A4 and B1) As expected, chlorophyll a cell-1 decreased under high light acclimation in both symbionts. However, only A4 saw a subsequent reduction in absorbance whereas cellular volume decreased in the B1 (S. minutum) symbiont. In response to high light acclimation, Fv/Fm was significantly lower at all excitation wavelengths for the B1 symbiont where as efficiencies remained the same for A4. However, high-light acclimated Fq'/Fm' levels decreased in both symbionts, but only when measured using the 615 or 625 nm excitation wavelengths. Non-photochemical quenching within the antennae bed was downregulated under high light acclimation in the A4 symbiont, but only when measured using the 505 and 530 nm excitation wavelengths. Such changes in Fq'/Fm' and antennae bed quenching highlight the benefits of spectrally resolved photochemical measurements. Additionally, the utilization of Arduino and Bitscope hardware exemplifies the potential of open source development platforms for construction of highly customizable instrumentation for photosynthetic research. © © 2017 Hoadley and Warner.

AB  - An efficient practical method for bipolar transistor application for neutron fluence registration is presented. The method is focused on neutron fluences damage effect correlation for various sources to reference source. The bipolar transistor connection diagram and an example of device realization based on STM32 microcontroller are described. STM32 is used for providing test signals and parameter registration used for gain factor calculation of bipolar transistors monitor (BTM). The proposed approach allows considering the features of pre-irradiated at reference source BTM and their application as the neutron fluence monitors. These connection diagram and constructive solutions provide 'on-line' neutron fluence registration for different sources in terms of reference source as required for radiation tests results verification. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - This paper introduces a newly developed Object-Oriented Open Software Architecture designed for supporting security applications, while leveraging on the capabilities offered by dedicated Open Hardware devices. Specifically, we target the SEcube™ platform, an Open Hardware security platform based on a 3D SiP (System on Package) designed and produced by Blu5 Group. The platform integrates three components employed for security in a single package: a Cortex-M4 CPU, a FPGA and an EAL5+ certified Smart Card. The Open Software Architecture targets both the host machine and the security device, together with the secure communication among them. To maximize its usability, this architecture is organized in several abstraction layers, ranging from hardware interfaces to device drivers, from security APIs to advanced applications, like secure messaging and data protection. We aim at releasing a multi-platform Open Source security framework, where software and hardware cooperate to hide to both the developer and the final users classical security concepts like cryptographic algorithms and keys, focusing, instead, on common operational security concepts like groups and policies. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - This paper introduces a low-cost AC meter designed to continuously measure voltage and current waveforms at up to 14 kHz. The AC power meter, provided as open hardware, is designed using the same micro controller as the Arduino UNO1 with an In-system Programming (ISP) interface, thus allowing the user to change the firmware to match their particular use case using Arduino libraries or standard C language. The suggested design is compatible with the Raspberry Pi 32, making it a suitable real-time measurement accessory for the single board computer. The platform features an 8 channel simultaneous sampling Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) which allows a high fidelity sampling without time offsets. Depending on how the user decides to combine current transformers (CTs) and AC-AC voltage adapters for the input channels, circuit breakers or appliances can be measured in either one phase or three phases. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - The advent of easy-to-use open source microcontrollers, off-the-shelf electronics and customizable manufacturing technologies has facilitated the development of inexpensive scientific devices and laboratory equipment. In this study, we describe an imaging system that integrates low-cost and open-source hardware, software and genetic resources. The multi-fluorescence imaging system consists of readily available 470 nm LEDs, a Raspberry Pi camera and a set of filters made with low cost acrylics. This device allows imaging in scales ranging from single colonies to entire plates. We developed a set of genetic components (e.g. promoters, coding sequences, terminators) and vectors following the standard framework of Golden Gate, which allowed the fabrication of genetic constructs in a combinatorial, low cost and robust manner. In order to provide simultaneous imaging of multiple wavelength signals, we screened a series of long stokes shift fluorescent proteins that could be combined with cyan/green fluorescent proteins. We found CyOFP1, mBeRFP and sfGFP to be the most compatible set for 3-channel fluorescent imaging. We developed open source Python code to operate the hardware to run time-lapse experiments with automated control of illumination and camera and a Python module to analyze data and extract meaningful biological information. To demonstrate the potential application of this integral system, we tested its performance on a diverse range of imaging assays often used in disciplines such as microbial ecology, microbiology and synthetic biology. We also assessed its potential use in a high school environment to teach biology, hardware design, optics, and programming. Together, these results demonstrate the successful integration of open source hardware, software, genetic resources and customizable manufacturing to obtain a powerful, low cost and robust system for education, scientific research and bioengineering.

AB  - The race to achieve smart cities is producing a continuous effort to adapt new developments and knowledge, for administrations and citizens. Information and Communications Technology are called on to be one of the key players to get these cities to use smart devices and sensors (Internet of Things) to know at every moment what is happening within the city, in order to make decisions that will improve the management of resources. The proliferation of these “smart things” is producing significant deployment of networks in the city context. Most of these devices are proprietary solutions, which do not offer free access to the data they provide. Therefore, this prevents the interoperability and compatibility of these solutions in the current smart city developments. This paper presents how to embed an open sensorized platform for both hardware and software in the context of a smart city, more specifically in a university campus. For this integration, GIScience comes into play, where it offers different open standards that allow full control over “smart things” as an agile and interoperable way to achieve this. To test our system, we have deployed a network of different sensorized platforms inside the university campus, in order to monitor environmental phenomena. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This article describes a complete characterization system for photovoltaic devices designed to acquire the current-voltage curve and to process the obtained data. The proposed system can be replicated for educational or research purposes without having wide knowledge about electronic engineering. Using standard calibrated instrumentation, commonly available in any laboratory, the accuracy of measurements is ensured. A capacitive load is used to bias the device due to its versatility and simplicity. The system includes a common part and an interchangeable part that must be designed depending on the electrical characteristics of each PV device. Control software, developed in LabVIEW, controls the equipment, performs automatic campaigns of measurements, and performs additional calculations in real time. These include different procedures to extrapolate the measurements to standard test conditions and methods to obtain the intrinsic parameters of the single diode model. A deep analysis of the uncertainty of measurement is also provided. Finally, the proposed system is validated by comparing the results obtained from some commercial photovoltaic modules to the measurements given by an independently accredited laboratory. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Open source hardware projects are becoming more and more common. OpenRISC SOC, one of the prominent of these projects, has become quite popular with the support of volunteer developers. In this work, we have demonstrated the design of an DES (Data Encryption Standard) based system, that can be used in security applications, on ORPSoC-v2 (Openrisc Reference Platform System-on-Chip). Additionally, we have showed that the system works successfully with a sample C application on an fPgA. This work emphasizes design security and flexibility features of open source systems against alternative closed source solutions. Another purpose of this study is to establish a platform for future studies on the analysis of side channel attacks. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - This paper summarises progress made towards the radiation hardening of LED emergency luminaires for evacuation and emergency response within the underground areas of the CERN accelerator complex. The objective has been to radiation harden existing Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) emergency luminaires to maximise lighting performance, without compromising IEC 60598-2-22 compliance. A systems level approach has been adopted, leading to the development of a diode bridge based AC/DC power converter. Modified COTS luminaires including this converter design have been irradiated (to 100 kGy TID using a Cobalt-60 source), with results of a subsequent photometric analysis presented. Following encouraging tests results, a reference design for the power converter has been released under the CERN Open Hardware License to encourage manufacturer adoption. The paper concludes with areas of interest for future research in further improving the radiation hardness of LED emergency lighting for accelerators with detailed studies at the component level for high power white LED devices and associated optical components. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Although there are a large number of autonomous robot platforms for ground contact and flying robots, this has not been the case for underwater robotic platforms. This is not due to the lack of interesting applications in the shallow underwater domain (50m depth), but rather due to the relative cost of building such platforms. This has recently changed with the development of inexpensive thrusters and other underwater components. Leveraging these components and design principles learned from more expensive remotely operated vehicles this paper describes Milton, an inexpensive open hardware design for a traditional thruster-based underwater robot. Utilizing commercial off-the-shelf hardware and a ROS infrastructure, Milton, and Milton-inspired designs provide an inexpensive platform for autonomous underwater vehicle research. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Arduino boards, a current trending open-source platform technology, are being used by museums and other institutions to create interactive exhibits for their patrons. Academic libraries are often faced with the challenge of finding new inspirations to educate and engage patrons. The Illuminated Lifestyles exhibit at Binghamton University was an attempt to teach library users about the sensory experiences of medieval manuscripts using touch technology. Relatively inexpensive, these boards can be incorporated in various ways to make an exhibit interactive. In this case, the boards were used in conjunction with large-scale frames covered with digitized replicas of manuscript leaves that spoke to the viewer as they touched the images. This case study explains the technology and platforms used within the exhibit and what the long-term impacts and benefits, if any, the library experienced. © 2017, Published with license by Taylor & Francis © 2017, © Kristen Gallant and Juan Denzer.

AB  - This letter presents the depth control of an autonomous micro diving agent called autonomous diving agent (ADA). ADA consists of off-The-shelf components and features open-source hardware and firmware. It can be deployed as a testbed for depth controllers, as well as a mobile sensor platform for research or in industrial tanks.We introduce a control law that is based on the feedback linearization method and enhanced by an adaptive fuzzy algorithm to cope with modeling inaccuracies. The proposed depth controller is computationally light enough to run on ADAs embedded hardware. In experiments performed in a wave tank, the adaptive fuzzy scheme shows the ability to deal with both depth regulation and depth profile tracking. ADA is even able to hold on to dynamic isobars despite external disturbances. We demonstrate that under the influence of waves, ADA describes orbital motions similar to water particles. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - This article describes the design of a low-cost USB-controlled potentiostat/galvanostat which can measure or apply potentials in the range of ±8 V, and measure or apply currents ranging from nanoamps to max. ±25 mA. Precision is excellent thanks to the on-board 20-bit D/A-convertor and 22-bit A/D-convertors. The dual control modes and its wide potential range make it especially suitable for battery characterization. As an example use case, measurements are presented on a lithium-ion test cell using thin-film anatase TiO2 as the working electrode. A cross-platform Python program may be used to run electrochemical experiments within an easy-to-use graphical user interface. Designed with an open hardware philosophy and using open-source tools, all the details of the project (including the schematic, PCB design, microcontroller firmware, and host computer software) are freely available, making custom modifications of the design straightforward. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - A programmable optical stimulator for Drosophila eyes is presented. The target application of the stimulator is to induce retinal degeneration in fly photoreceptor cells by exposing them to light in a controlled manner. The goal of this work is to obtain a reproducible system for studying age-related changes in susceptibility to environmental ocular stress. The stimulator uses light emitting diodes and an embedded computer to control illuminance, color (blue or red) and duration in two independent chambers. Further, the stimulator is equipped with per-chamber light and temperature sensors and a fan to monitor light intensity and to control temperature. An ON/OFF temperature control implemented on the embedded computer keeps the temperature from reaching levels that will induce the heat shock stress response in the flies. A custom enclosure was fabricated to house the electronic components of the stimulator. The enclosure provides a light-impermeable environment that allows air flow and lets users easily load and unload fly vials. Characterization results show that the fabricated stimulator can produce light at illuminances ranging from 0 to 16000 lux and power density levels from 0 to 7.2 mW/cm2 for blue light. For red light the maximum illuminance is 8000 lux which corresponds to a power density of 3.54 mW/cm2. The fans and the ON/OFF temperature control are able to keep the temperature inside the chambers below 28.17 °C. Experiments with white-eye male flies were performed to assess the ability of the fabricated simulator to induce blue light-dependent retinal degeneration. Retinal degeneration is observed in flies exposed to 8 h of blue light at 7949 lux. Flies in a control experiment with no light exposure show no retinal degeneration. Flies exposed to red light for the similar duration and light intensity (8 h and 7994 lux) do not show retinal degeneration either. Hence, the fabricated stimulator can be used to create environmental ocular stress using blue light. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - Working together, heated and unheated temperature sensors can recognize contact with different materials and contact with the human body. As such, distributing these sensors across a robot's body could be beneficial for operation in human environments. We present a stretchable fabric-based skin with force and thermal sensors that is suitable for covering areas of a robot's body, including curved surfaces. It also adds a layer of compliance that conforms to manipulated objects, improving thermal sensing. Our open hardware design addresses thermal sensing challenges, such as the time to heat the sensors, the efficiency of sensing, and the distribution of sensors across the skin. It incorporates small self-heated temperature sensors on the surface of the skin that directly make contact with objects, improving the sensors’ response times. Our approach seeks to fully cover the robot's body with large force sensors, but treats temperature sensors as small, point-like sensors sparsely distributed across the skin. We present a mathematical model to help predict how many of these point-like temperature sensors should be used in order to increase the likelihood of them making contact with an object. To evaluate our design, we conducted tests in which a robot arm used a cylindrical end effector covered with skin to slide objects and press on objects made from four different materials. After assessing the safety of our design, we also had the robot make contact with the forearms and clothed shoulders of 10 human participants. With 2.0 s of contact, the actively-heated temperature sensors enabled binary classification accuracy over 90% for the majority of material pairs. The system could more rapidly distinguish between materials with large differences in their thermal effusivities (e.g., 90% accuracy for pine wood vs. aluminum with 0.5 s of contact). For discrimination between humans vs. the four materials, the skin's force and thermal sensing modalities achieved 93% classification accuracy with 0.5 s of contact. Overall, our results suggest that our skin design could enable robots to recognize contact with distinct task-relevant materials and humans while performing manipulation tasks in human environments. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - As the open source development of additive manufacturing has led to low-cost desktop three-dimensional (3-D) printing, a number of scientists throughout the world have begun to share digital designs of free and open source scientific hardware. Open source scientific hardware enables custom experimentation, laboratory control, rapid upgrading, transparent maintenance, and lower costs in general. To aid in this trend, this study describes the development, design, assembly, and operation of a 3-D printable open source desktop nutating mixer, which provides a fixed 20° platform tilt angle for a gentle three-dimensional (gyrating) agitation of chemical or biological samples (e.g., DNA or blood samples) without foam formation. The custom components for the nutating mixer are designed using open source FreeCAD software to enable customization. All of the non-readily available components can be fabricated with a low-cost RepRap 3-D printer using an open source software tool chain from common thermoplastics. All of the designs are open sourced and can be configured to add more functionality to the equipment in the future. It is relatively easy to assemble and is accessible to both the science education of younger students as well as state-of-the-art research laboratories. Overall, the open source nutating mixer can be fabricated with US $ 37 in parts, which is 1/10th of the cost of proprietary nutating mixers with similar capabilities. The open source nature of the device allow it to be easily repaired or upgraded with digital files, as well as to accommodate custom sample sizes and mixing velocities with minimal additional costs. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Drowsy driving is the primary cause of motor vehicle accidents and is a risk factor that leads to the loss of human life, remaining as a challenge for the global automotive industry. Recently, drowsy monitoring system has been actively studied for prediction system based machine learning. However, the challenges of automotive real-time constraints and flexibility should be taken into consideration against a large amount of heterogeneous data from vehicle network and other device. To solve this problem, we propose drowsy monitoring system based machine learning using GS1 standard. First, vehicle motion data is defined and modeled using the GS1 standard language for drowsy predict. Second, we propose an optimal algorithm selection and detail architecture for automotive real-time environments through machine learning algorithms (KNN, Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression) and deep learning algorithms (RNN-LSTM). Finally, we describe system-wide integration and implementation through the open source hardware Raspberry Pi and the machine learning SW framework. We provide optimal LSTM architecture and implementation that takes into account the real-time environmental conditions and how to improve the readability and usability of the vehicle motion data. We also share the rapid prototyping methodology case of connected car systems without other sensor devices. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Mixed-reality environments allow to combine tangible interaction with digital feedback, empowering interaction designers to take benefits from both real and virtual worlds. This interaction paradigm is also being applied in classrooms for learning purposes. However, most of the times the devices supporting mixed-reality interaction are neither portable nor affordable, which could be a limitation in the learning context. In this paper we propose CETA, a mixed-reality environment using low-cost Android tablets which tackles portability and costs issues. In addition, CETA is open-source, reproducible and extensible.

AB  - In pursuit of coping mechanisms for the challenges of sustainable manufacturing, systematic methods have been developed to allow engineers to improve the ratio between products’ utility and environmental impact. These necessary efforts remain however limited if the surrounding production and consumption practices are not called into question at the same time. This article introduces open source product development as a potential approach for unlocking the limits of existing sustainable product design practices and to lead towards alternative and eco-efficient production and consumption practices termed as participative production. First, it discusses the potential advantages of this emerging practice in terms of environmental sustainability. Second, it provides a screened qualitative environmental analysis of 18 exemplary open source hardware products. Specific sustainable design principles implemented by these products are highlighted and discussed in order to identify challenges for further common research in the field of open source and sustainable product development. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This paper presents a data acquisition unit which synchronously samples multiple channels in a manner such that the time of day at which each sample is taken is known. This allows measurements taken at multiple locations to be compared with confidence. The intended application is wide area electrical power system measurements, in particular phasor measurement units (PMUs). The novelty of the authors' design is the application of an open hardware development platform to discipline a commodity analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to a broadcast time signal, usually but not exclusively GPS. The methodology used creates a driver layer for the ADC to achieve real-time sampling in a nonpreemptive Linux environment. The use of open hardware and software addresses the need for a transparent instrument for use in research and development of PMU technology. Through a choice of either a software or hardware phase-locked loop, the ADC is controlled to acquire exactly 256 samples per nominal power system cycle (i.e., 50/60 Hz), precisely time synchronized to GPS, at 16-b resolution and 94.2-dB SNR. The design of a printed circuit board expansion board featuring all necessary components is provided. The performance of the system is evaluated. Interoperability and data exchange with other systems is achieved by use of open schemas and communication protocols. This allows rapid integration with popular numerical simulation environments. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - This study analyzes a low-cost reliable real-time optical monitoring platform for fused filament fabrication-based open source 3D printing. An algorithm for reconstructing 3D images from overlapping 2D intensity measurements with relaxed camera positioning requirements is compared with a single-camera solution for single-side 3D printing monitoring. The algorithms are tested for different 3D object geometries and filament colors. The results showed that both of the algorithms with a single- and double-camera system were effective at detecting a clogged nozzle, incomplete project, or loss of filament for a wide range of 3D object geometries and filament colors. The combined approach was the most effective and achieves 100% detection rate for failures. The combined method analyzed here has a better detection rate and a lower cost compared to previous methods. In addition, this method is generalizable to a wide range of 3D printer geometries, which enables further deployment of desktop 3D printing as wasted print time and filament are reduced, thereby improving the economic advantages of distributed manufacturing. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.

AB  - 3-D printing has entered the consumer market because of recent radical price declines. Consumers can save substantial money by offsetting purchases with DIY pre-designed 3-D printed products. However, even more value can be obtained with distributed manufacturing using mass customization. Unfortunately, the average consumer is not technically sophisticated enough to easily design their own products. One solution to this is the use of an overlay on OpenSCAD parametric code, although current solutions force users to relinquish all rights to their own designs. There is thus a substantial need in the open source design community for a libre 3-D model customizer, which can be used in any design repository to democratize design. This study reports on the design, function, and validation of such software: the Free Open Source 3-D Customizer. It is demonstrated with a case study of the customization of 3-D printable external breast prosthetics. The results showed that novice users can adjust the available parameters according to their needs and save these to a new file on a website. This PHP (recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) library is free and open source and has potential for increasing the usefulness of online repositories to enable distributed manufacturing using consumer customized 3-D printable products. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - The primary objective of the paper is to construct and test a low-cost, minimally supervised gesture recognition system which identifies static gestures efficiently and accurately. The proposed system uses ADXL335 accelerometer sensors which track the gestures and these sensors are interfaced with an Arduino ATMega 2560 micro-controller for data processing and gesture recognition. The software of the system implemented in the micro-controller, features a computationally feasible algorithm which requires only nominal resources to recognize the gestures. The paper further elucidates on minimizing the number of accelerometers to reduce the cost and power-consumption of the system. The performance of the system is assessed using static gestures in the alphabets of the American Sign Language (ASL) across data-sets obtained from 3 trained ASL signers. The average run-time efficiency of the proposed system with a maximum and minimum configuration of 5 and 2 accelerometers was found to be 95.3% and 87.0%, with the cost of these prototype systems being realized at 20 USD and 12.5 USD respectively. It was also found that the system can be trained for the static gestures of the alphabets in ASL under two minutes by a new-user with any system configuration. The authors also feel that the system is compatible with other IoT platforms for interoperability. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Particulate matter pollution becomes an increasingly important problem in developing countries and poses a hazard to human health especially in indoor environment. At the same time, modern buildings are equipped with advanced sensing and control technologies, offering control and optimization capabilities over a large range of parameters. This paper proposes an open platform of a WiFi-enabled indoor air quality monitoring and control system, which could be incorporated into such a 'smart building' structure. The complete software and hardware design of this system is presented, along with a series of control experiments. The proposed system operates over an existing WiFi wireless network utilizing the MQTT protocol. It is capable of monitoring the indoor air quality as well as controlling an air purifier to regulate the particulate matters concentration. Experiment results under a real world office environment demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Tangible learning is a promising branch, especially for scientific learning, allowing an enhanced sensorial involvement and participation by children. While a lot is being done on the side of programming, less has been investigated on elementary spatial and geometric concepts. The paper presents i-Vertex, an open-hardware framework for tangible serious games on geometry concepts for primary school pupils. The framework targets spatial reasoning and includes music as a related and complementary feature, which should add value also for usability. i-Vertex supports collaboration between kids and the key role of a teacher as an adult that interacts with the children in different ways, introducing them to the discovery and understanding of basic geometric concepts and physical phenomenon. At present, we have built a prototype, featuring a very limited number of vertices, and functionally tested it in lab, in two main scenarios covering topics such as lines and triangles. Based on the successful feedback of this experiment, we intend to proceed further, upgrading the platform with a more powerful and product oriented micro-controller and board. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper, a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) solution is proposed for soil's condition measurement to monitor oil palm plantations (PalmNET) according to agricultural meteorological practices. The PalmNET monitoring system is composed by a WSN used for in-field soil's condition measurement and a web-server interface for data visualization. PalmNET can automatically collect soil moisture data and transmit field data through a ZigBee network to a web-server. The PalmNET proof-of-concept is a WSN built upon open-source hardware and software, which includes two sensor nodes, a sink and a Gateway with a GPRS module. The WSN was deployed in Palmar de la Vizcaína Experimental Field Station having the following proof of concept objectives: (i) collect and centralize soil moisture data and (ii) post data to a web application interface. Results have revealed PalmNET as a feasible, automated and solar powered application for oil palm plantations in Colombia. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents the usage of Internet of Things concept as a tool for retrofitting air conditioning systems. The proposed technology consists in an embedded system developed with an open-source hardware platform and connected through a wireless sensor and actuator mesh network. By learning commands from the air conditioner's remote control, the system is capable of implementing automatic control of the air conditioner equipment. Through a central command unit, it is possible to configure timers to turn on and off all devices connected to the network. The system also adds intelligence to conventional equipment by making use of a motion sensor, avoiding electricity waste. An automatic temperature control is implemented through sensors that monitor external conditions. By making use of a mesh network based on DigiMesh protocol, each device acts like a router, increasing network range and making it easier to add or remove new devices. The proposed system was validated through case study. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Because of the rapid development of EtherCAT as the standard fieldbus in control and automation and the increasing demands of low cost portable main controllers, we aim to assess the performance of an EtherCAT network in handling real-time demands using open source EtherCAT master protocol on open hardware platforms. In comparison to that of commercial products, the performance of open platforms is still indefinite and may depend on different indicators such as the kernel version, real-time architecture, and the protocol of EtherCAT. This paper provides implementation guidelines and procedures to develop the embedded platforms-a task which is difficult due to lack of systematic documents and technical support. The real-time evaluation of an open source EtherCAT master with a dual-kernel approach of real-time embedded Linux, Xenomai, is performed to validate that even low-cost open embedded hardware platforms are also capable in performing real-time EtherCAT control applications. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Open Source Hardware allows users to share, customize, and improve designs, thus enabling technological advancement through communities of practice. We propose open source hardware for educational haptics that permits researchers, educators, and students to share designs arising from their different perspectives, with the potential to expand educational applications. In this paper we present a family of open source kinesthetic haptic devices that build upon the design of a previous educational haptic device, Hapkit 3.0. First, we discuss methods for Hapkit personalization and customization that can be achieved by K-12 students and educators. Next, we describe two kinesthetic haptic device designs that evolved from the original Hapkit 3.0. One uses two standard Hapkits with additional components to form a Pantograph mechanism, and the other uses customized Hapkit elements along with a novel kinematic design to form a serial mechanism. These designs are modular; after building two Hapkits, a user acquires a small number of additional parts to transform them into a two-degree-of-freedom device. The Pantograph mechanism was used in an undergraduate class to teach robotics and haptics to both engineering and nonengineering students. Open source designs for all devices as well as tutorials for customization are available at http://hapkit.stanford.edu. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - The noise pollution is still a troubling problem for us, especial in hospital, library, baby-care center, etc. Although many decibel-meters are applied to those environment, which indeed must be kept quit, but the decibel-meters can only detect the noise pollution limited to nearest area around the device. We will face the incorrect measuring data from the decibel-meters in bigger space like library. According such problems mentioned above, maybe we use more decibel-meters around different areas to a better solution. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Taking design inspiration from biological creatures can enable inheriting functional aspects such as locomotion of the target creatures in their robotic counterparts. Bio-inspired robots are particularly useful in dealing with applications involving surveillance, reconnaissance, and environment monitoring. Non-availability of inexpensive robotic platforms causes a barrier in the advancement of this field. This paper reports an open source alligator-inspired quadruped robotic platform which is easy and fast to prototype, open to design iterations and affordable. The reported approach utilizes laser cutting based fabrication and thereby reduces the development time drastically. The main features of the reported open source hardware system comprise of fabrication and assembly plan in the form of dxf files, embedded electrical circuits in the form of circuit diagrams and PCB layouts, and a locomotion control system in the form of software. We believe that such an open source design can accelerate research and development activities in the area of bio-inspired design as the researchers can improvise upon the open source model rather than starting from scratch. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - The chip industry faces two key challenges today -The impending end of Moore's Law and the rising costs of chip design and verification (millions of dollars today). Heterogeneous IPs - cores and domain-specific accelerators -Are a promising answer to the first challenge, enabling performance and energy benefits no longer provided by technology scaling. IP-reuse with plug-And-play designs can help with the second challenge, amortizing NRE costs tremendously. A key requirement in a heterogeneous IP-based plug-And-play SoC environment is an interconnection fabric to connect these IPs together. This fabric needs to be scalable - low latency, low energy and low area -And yet be flexible/parametrizable for use across designs. The key scalability challenge in any Network-on-Chip (NoC) today is that the latency increases proportional to the number of hops. In this work, we present a NoC generator called OpenSMART, which generates low-latency NoCs based on SMART1. SMART is a recently proposed NoC microarchitecture that enables multihop on-chip traversals within a single cycle, removing the dependence of latency on hops. SMART leverages wire delay of the underlying repeated wires, and augments each router with the ability to request and setup bypass paths. OpenSMART takes SMART from a NoC optimization to a design methodology for SoCs, enabling users to generate verified RTL for a class of userspecified network configurations, such as network size, topology, routing algorithm, number of VCs/buffers, router pipeline stages, and so on. OpenSMART also provides the ability to generate any heterogeneous topology with low and high-radix routers and optimized single-stage pipelines, leveraging fast logic delays in technology nodes today. OpenSMART v1.0 comes with both Bluespec System Verilog and Chisel implementations, and this paper also presents a case study of our experiences with both languages. OpenSMART is available for download2 and is going to be a key addition to the emerging open-source hardware movement, providing a glue for interconnecting existing and emerging IPs. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - A Temporary Immersion System (TIS) enables plant micropropagation in unsterilized sealed environments. However, it is a complicated and expensive technology. In this paper, an automation alternative based on open hardware and software platforms is presented, with the objectives of reducing costs and increasing performance as compared with commercial systems, through software reconfiguration of routines for nutrient application, constant monitoring and remote control of the system. For hardware development, the Bottom Up methodology was used, and Kanban methodology was used for the software. The cost of the proposed system is on average 10% that of commercial electronic devices used in the industry to solve process automation problems. Growth assessment of the explants is necessary to corroborate the competitive advantages of the prototype relative to the traditional systems of temporary immersion. © 2017 Mexican Society of Soil Science.

AB  - As the population in cities continues to increase rapidly, air pollution becomes a serious issue from public health to social economy. Among all pollutants, fine particulate matters (PM2.5) directly related to various serious health concerns, e.g., lung cancer, premature death, asthma, and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. To enhance the quality of urban living, sensors are deployed to create smart cities. In this paper, we present a participatory urban sensing framework for PM2.5 monitoring with more than 2500 devices deployed in Taiwan and 29 other countries. It is one of the largest deployment project for PM2.5 monitor in the world as we know until May 2017. The key feature of the framework is its open system architecture, which is based on the principles of open hardware, open source software, and open data. To facilitate the deployment of the framework, we investigate the accuracy issue of low-cost particle sensors with a comprehensive set of comparison evaluations to identify the most reliable sensor. By working closely with government authorities, industry partners, and maker communities, we can construct an effective eco-system for participatory urban sensing of PM2.5 particles. Based on our deployment achievements to date, we provide a number of data services to improve environmental awareness, trigger on-demand responses, and assist future government policymaking. The proposed framework is highly scalable and sustainable with the potential to facilitate the Internet of Things, smart cities, and citizen science in the future. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems can consume a large percentage of the energy used in a typical building. Intelligent building automation systems (BAS) are widely deployed to enable more efficient HVAC utilization, thus reducing the energy consumed. Enhanced data requires distributed sensing. We propose an instrumentation system for a low-cost, over-the-top efficiency monitor using the open-source hardware design to enable rapid deployment and live monitoring of temperature within zones such as rooms. This enables evaluation of HVAC system efficiency, and building parameter monitoring in that room. This paper presents our HVAC, thermal, and building parameter monitoring system design and considerations using an open-source hardware approach for fast customizations. We show results of monitoring two buildings including distributed sensing within rooms, and discuss intelligence gathered through use of this system as a precursor towards a fully automated efficiency evaluation and measurement. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - With the open source sharing of the RepRap, a self-replicating rapid prototyper, low-cost 3-D printing is now a technically viable form of distributed manufacturing for a variety of products. In addition, the subsequent development of the recyclebot, an open source 3-D filament extruder, enables raw materials to be sourced from the household waste of a prosumer-one who produces that which he or she consumes. Millions of free and open source designs are now available on the Internet, and as this article shows using life-cycle analysis, prosumers can radically reduce both the economic costs of goods and the environmental impact as compared to conventionally manufactured goods by utilizing the most aggressive form of distributed manufacturing: making the products they need at home using digital designs created from what would otherwise be their waste. Finally, some of the most likely future technical developments will be reviewed to provide guidance into the potential for distributed manufacturing in the future and the subsequent effect on the environment. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Most initiatives about embedded sensing capabilities in computational systems lead to devise an ad hoc sensor platform, usually poorly reusable, as a first stage to prepare a data corpus or production prototype. In this paper, an open source hardware platform for sensing is described. This platform was intended to be used in data acquisition for gait identification, and is designed in a way general enough so many other projects could reuse the design to accelerate prototyping. The platform is based on popular open source hardware and software like Arduino and Raspberry Pi using well known languages and libraries. Some experimental results about the throughput of the overall system are reported showing the feasibility of acquiring data from up to 6 sensors with a sampling frequency no less than 118 Hz. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We describe the implementation of an OPT plate to perform optical projection tomography (OPT) on a commercial wide-field inverted microscope, using our open-source hardware and software. The OPT plate includes a tilt adjustment for alignment and a stepper motor for sample rotation as required by standard projection tomography. Depending on magnification requirements, three methods of performing OPT are detailed using this adaptor plate: a conventional direct OPT method requiring only the addition of a limiting aperture behind the objective lens; an external optical-relay method allowing conventional OPT to be performed at magnifications ≥4x; a remote focal scanning and region-of-interest method for improved spatial resolution OPT (up to ∼1.6 μm). All three methods use the microscope's existing incoherent light source (i.e. arc-lamp) and all of its inherent functionality is maintained for day-to-day use. OPT acquisitions are performed on in vivo zebrafish embryos to demonstrate the implementations' viability. © 2017 Watson et al.

AB  - In this paper, we present a low-cost approach to upgrade an outdated PUMA (Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly) 560 robot in order to widen the number and type of possible hands-on experiments in control and instrumentation education. Another aim of the upgrade is to enable its future connection to a remote laboratory. We propose a scalable structure to control and monitoring PUMA560 motors. This approach combines several different technologies: A Raspberry Pi for control and monitoring, Python to control the system and chart data, as well as converters and drivers with serial I2C bus interface connectivity to read/write data from/to Puma560 robot. The ideas here explained could be applicable to other physical systems with similar characteristics and number of variables. © 2017

AB  - In engineering, traditional approaches aimed at teaching concepts of dynamics to engineering students include the study of a dense yet sequential theoretical development of proofs and exercises. Structural dynamics are seldom taught experimentally in laboratories since these facilities should be provided with expensive equipment such as wave generators, data-acquisition systems, and heavily wired deployments with sensors. In this paper, the design of an experimental experience in the classroom based upon digital fabrication and modeling tools related to structural dynamics is presented. In particular, all experimental deployments are conceived with low-cost, open-source equipment. The hardware includes Arduino-based open-source electronics whereas the software is based upon object-oriented open-source codes for the development of physical simulations. The set of experiments and the physical simulations are reproducible and scalable in classroom-based environments. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Currently, more and more organizations are aware of the increasing potential of nanoscience and nanotechnology, due to the wide field of innovative applications they address from biomedical and molecular technology to semiconductor and material sciences. Nanotechnology is an area where fundamental or applicative research is still in progress and where many industrial applications are waited to come. Despite the progress of this field, many institutions, notably educational ones, cannot afford investing in these technologies allowing an access to nanoscale, and a lack of knowledge therefore remains. The Nanœye project focuses on the widespread of Atomic Force Microscopy or AFM technology, which is the basic access tool to the nanoscale. The main goal is to design an optimal AFM model in terms of manufacturing costs by using rapid prototyping techniques and open-source hardware, and designing it as an educational-oriented equipment. This approach is two-fold: as an AFM-unexperienced user discovering its principle of operation at nanoscale or as a future engineer understanding its multi-disciplinary structure involving mechanics, optics, electronics, software and control sciences. This paper introduces the first functional structure of Nanœye AFM project, focusing on its mechanical structure. It is submitted to the IFAC2017 special feature Automatic Control Demonstrators. © 2017

AB  - This paper presents the results of the development of a modular open source platform for experimental control setups. This platform emerged from research on the automatic rotation start-up and landing of a tethered airplane for wind energy harvesting, implementing and testing promising theoretical concepts such as real-time moving horizon estimation (MHE) and non-linear model predictive control (NMPC) on hardware developed in parallel. As experimental setups for testing new control algorithms tend to be fine-tuned by trial and error methods, a rapid control prototyping system for fast evaluation had to be implemented. Technical results of this research are presented in the form of a modular platform for real-time control. The created platform provides a complete toolchain for performing, observing and evaluating control experiments. It offers modular low-cost hardware and free software especially suited for flight control experiments. Clearly defined interfaces between the components allow for expanding on its current capabilities for other control scenarios in need of fast and reliable real-time control. The provided modularity allows for spatial separation of high performance computing hardware from low-level components, permits rapid reconfiguration of the experiment and eases the collaboration and workflow between hardware developers and control engineers. © 2017

AB  - Since 2001, the departments of Electrical and Electronics and Information and Communication Electronics Engineering of Faculty of Engineering, the University of Tokyo (UTokyo) have jointly given a lecture on autonomous electronic information devices for undergraduate students. According to the on-line questionnaire, 80% of students in 2010-2012 replied that the lecture was useful for their future career. The task given to students was to design and realise an autonomous electronic information devices (so-called 'the IoT-gadgets') by themselves, and conduct a live demonstration in front of their colleagues. The device must have an 'input', 'output', and some 'information processing'. Being aware of the speed of technology evolution as well as the short hours of the lecture, the professor tried not to give direct answers to students' questions on how-to instantly build and program an information device. Instead, the students were told to beware of their 'methods'. This refers to the deductive thinking introduced by René Descartes, and in the lecture's context how students should behave in order to realise the device. In this study, the backgrounds of various associated topics are discussed, such as the UTokyo's educational system, the world's rapid prototyping movement, open hardware, course design, students' reactions, and future directions.

AB  - The demand of the industry for high performance electric motors has significantly increased nowadays. This has boosted the usage of permanent magnet brushless synchronous motors (BLSM) in many applications where the accuracy and performance requirements are high. Further improvement of the BLSM drive systems performance can be achieved by providing them with adaptive control capabilities. The relative complexity of adaptive control schemes and algorithms and the computational load that they impose have prevented until recently their practical implementation into the industrial servo systems. In this investigation, a neuro-Adaptive control scheme where the rule for parameter adaptation is designed by taking into account the variable structure control (VSC) concepts and Lyapunov stability, is proposed and embedded into an inexpensive, available on the market, position control system for brushless synchronous servomotors. The experimental tests have been carried on using compact and flexible, based on open hardware and software concept, dual-Axis motion controllers PMC201/PMC202 manufactured by the PicoMotion Inc. The applied software has been written using the Motion Control Framework software platform, provided together with the above controllers. The results obtained with the proposed neuro-Adaptive control scheme have been compared to those obtained using the originally built into the system PI controller. The experiments have shown that the implemented advanced adaptive control approach is practically viable and can be embedded into the industrial motion control systems which will lead to their improved performance. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a light-weight rapid control prototyping (RCP) system based on off-the-shelf open source hardware to achieve high performance computing, cost effectiveness, portability, and easy accessiblity. The proposed RCP system consists of a PC-based computer-aided control system design (CACSD) tool for computing control action and tiny palm-sized open source hardware for input and output (I/O) operation and data transfer through a built-in high-speed USB interface. The popular-priced and portable open source hardware is used as a bridge between CACSD tools and real plants to deliver the control and sensor data at the sampling time points. Ten I/O function blocks written in C code are developed based on the CACSD tool employed for the proposed light-weight RCP system in order to handle I/O operation in a simple way. In addition, we suggest two practical strategies, a batch transfer strategy and a variable sampling period method, to increase the sampling rate of the control system. It is shown through experiment that the proposed light-weight RCP system works well up to a sampling rate of 2 kHz without adopting expensive hardware and C code generators. It is expected that the proposed RCP system will be considered as affordable and readily available to schools for mass education. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - An open hardware framework for approximating range and bearing of radio frequency (RF) sensors is presented. The current work has an immediate application in solving the simultaneous localization and mapping problem which is one of the challenging problems in the field of robotics. In this work, a set of RF sensors utilizing the ZigBee protocol are placed in an indoor environment and a base RF sensor is mounted within a rotating parabolic reflector on a mobile robot. The proposed range and bearing approximation framework works in two cascaded phases. In the first phase, the base RF sensor sends an RF signal to all other RF sensors within its operating range. These RF sensors then respond to the base RF module where ZigBee packets are parsed to store raw data for approximating range. In the second phase, a stepper motor is employed to rotate the parabolic reflector and the base RF sensor mounted on the robot. These two phases continue until a full revolution of 360° has been achieved. The data is processed for approximating the bearing of each RF sensor with respect to the mobile robot's heading angle, as well as the distance (range) to the RF sensor at its associated bearing. The proposed hardware setup is validated through a set of experimental results gathered in an indoor environment. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - We present an observational study of physical prototype critique that highlights some of the challenges of communicating physical behaviors and materiality at a distance. Geographically distributed open hardware communities often conduct user feedback and peer critique sessions via video conference. However, people have difficulty using current video conferencing tools to demonstrate and critique physical designs. To examine the challenges of remote critique, we conducted an observational lab study in which participants critiqued pairs of physical prototypes (prosthetic hands) for a face-to-face or remote collaborator. In both conditions, participants' material experiences were an important part of their critique, however their attention was divided between interacting with the prototype and finding strategies to communicate 'invisible' features. Based on our findings, we propose design implications for remote collaboration tools that support the sharing of material experiences and prototype critique. Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Concentrated solar power (CSP) plants are increasingly gaining interest as a source of renewable energy. These plants face several technical problems and the inspection of components such as absorber tubes in parabolic trough concentrators (PTC), which are widely deployed, is necessary to guarantee plant efficiency. This article presents a system for real-time industrial inspection of CSP plants using low-cost, open-source components in conjunction with a thermographic sensor and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The system, available in open-source hardware and software, is designed to be employed independently of the type of device used for inspection (laptop, smartphone, tablet or smartglasses) and its operating system. Several UAV flight missions were programmed as follows: flight altitudes at 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 m above ground level; and three cruising speeds: 5, 7 and 10 m/s. These settings were chosen and analyzed in order to optimize inspection time. The results indicate that it is possible to perform inspections by an UAV in real time at CSP plants as a means of detecting anomalous absorber tubes and improving the effectiveness of methodologies currently being utilized. Moreover, aside from thermographic sensors, this contribution can be applied to other sensors and can be used in a broad range of applications where real-time georeferenced data visualization is necessary. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Microprocessor (uP) Architecture and Programming constitute core courses in computer science and electronic engineering departments. A variety of tools has been used for gaining more knowledge and understanding the basic and advanced concepts of the course. These tools (hardware platforms and simulators) are focused mainly on assembly programming. Despite the existing tools, students still face great learning difficulties. On the other hand, key issues are the corresponding architecture and the programming features of the uP under studying. The above issues are not fully addressed by the existing tools. In this paper, a customizable hardware based uP simulator is presented and final proposed. Using this simulator, an experimental hypothetical educational uP can be built by students and the professors can create the corresponding learning scenarios. Based on the proposed approach, the experimental uP consists of identical hardware based blocks that can be reprogrammed for representing registers, arithmetic and logic unit, etc. Thus, the students can act now as uP architecture and assembly language designers gaining crucial knowledge in the field. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Here, we present a prototype of a smart building using newly surfacing technologies like IoT (Internet of Things), fog and cloud for the smart city. The demand for everything smart is increasing daily, but the main stumbling block is its high price. So, our aim is to improve the standard of living in home and in office with newly improved working facilities where the whole system will be automatic, efficient and will be under the control of the user via his/her smartphone or computer but the cost will stay within the budget of a common man. All these are done by the incorporation of IoT, fog and cloud. The assimilation is done using open source hardwares and softwares to reduce the cost dramatically than the other existing solutions and implement it in an impressive and ingenious way without compromising QoS (Quality of Service) of any of the functionalities provided by other existing solutions. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - The OpenOrbiter CubeSat Development Initiative is working to build a small spacecraft system using open source software and open hardware principles. Some important design considerations for the CubeSat are nonfunctional requirements. The key contribution of this work is presenting the design of a requirement engineering tool that can be used to speed up the requirement elicitation and specification of system-wide qualities such as availability, performance, and security based on the use of quality attribute scenarios. A prototype application, utilizing the concept of quality attribute scenarios which was originally proposed by the Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute (SEI), was designed and implemented. These quality attribute scenarios are the equivalent of UML scenarios and use-cases. They are built specifically to document the nonfunctional requirements and use a quality scenario template. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Objective. Closed-loop experiments, in which causal interventions are conditioned on the state of the system under investigation, have become increasingly common in neuroscience. Such experiments can have a high degree of explanatory power, but they require a precise implementation that can be difficult to replicate across laboratories. We sought to overcome this limitation by building open-source software that makes it easier to develop and share algorithms for closed-loop control. Approach. We created the Open Ephys GUI, an open-source platform for multichannel electrophysiology experiments. In addition to the standard 'open-loop' visualization and recording functionality, the GUI also includes modules for delivering feedback in response to events detected in the incoming data stream. Importantly, these modules can be built and shared as plugins, which makes it possible for users to extend the functionality of the GUI through a simple API, without having to understand the inner workings of the entire application. Main results. In combination with low-cost, open-source hardware for amplifying and digitizing neural signals, the GUI has been used for closed-loop experiments that perturb the hippocampal theta rhythm in a phase-specific manner. Significance. The Open Ephys GUI is the first widely used application for multichannel electrophysiology that leverages a plugin-based workflow. We hope that it will lower the barrier to entry for electrophysiologists who wish to incorporate real-time feedback into their research. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - We are developing room temperature electronics based upon the ROACH platform to readout microwave multiplexed X-ray TES. ROACH is an open-source hardware and software platform featuring a large Xilinx Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), Power PC processor, several 10 GB Ethernet SFP+ interfaces, and a collection of daughter boards for analog signal generation and acquisition. The combination of a ROACH board, ADC/DAC conversion daughter boards, and hardware for RF mixing allows for the generation and capture of multiple RF tones for reading out microwave multiplexed X-ray TES microcalorimeters. The FPGA is used to generate multiple tones in base band, from 10 MHz to 250 MHz, which are subsequently mixed to RF in the multiple GHz range and sent through the microwave multiplexer. The tones are generated in the FPGA by storing a large lookup table in Quad Data Rate SRAM modules and playing out the waveform to a DAC board. Once the signal has been modulated to RF, passed through the microwave multiplexer, and has been modulated back to base band, the signal is digitized by an ADC board. The tones are modulated to 0 Hz by using a FPGA circuit consisting of a polyphase filter bank, several Xilinx FFT blocks, Xilinx CORDIC blocks (for converting to magnitude and phase), and special phase accumulator circuit for mixing to exactly 0 Hz. Upwards of 256 channels can be simultaneously captured and written into a bank of 256 First-In-First-Out (FIFO) memories, with each FIFO corresponding to a channel. Individual channel data can be further processed in the FPGA before being streamed through a 10 GB Ethernet fiber-optic interface to a Linux system. The Linux system runs software written in Python and QT C++ for controlling the ROACH system, capturing data, and processing data. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Biochips, or digital labs-on-chip, are developed with the purpose of being used by laboratory technicians or biologists in laboratories or clinics. In this article, we expand this vision with the goal of enabling everyone, regardless of their expertise, to use biochips for their own personal purposes. We developed OPENDROP, an integrated electromicrofluidic platform that allows users to develop and program their own bio-applications. We address the main challenges that users may encounter: accessibility, bio-protocol design and interaction with microfluidics. OPENDROP consists of a do-it-yourself biochip, an automated software tool with visual interface and a detailed technique for at-home operations of microfluidics. We report on two years of use of OPENDROP, released as an open-source platform. Our platform attracted a highly diverse user base with participants originating from maker communities, academia and industry. Our findings show that 47% of attempts to replicate OPENDROP were successful, the main challenge remaining the assembly of the device. In terms of usability, the users managed to operate their platforms at home and are working on designing their own bio-applications. Our work provides a step towards a future in which everyone will be able to create microfluidic devices for their personal applications, thereby democratizing parts of health care. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - In the past decades, bioassays and whole-organism bioassay have become important tools not only in compliance testing of industrial chemicals and plant protection products, but also in the monitoring of environmental quality. With few exceptions, such test systems are discontinuous. They require exposure of the biological test material in small units, such as multiwell plates, during prolonged incubation periods, and do not allow online read-outs. It is mostly due to these shortcomings that applications in continuous monitoring of, e.g., drinking or surface water quality are largely missing. We propose the use of pipetting robots that can be used to automatically exchange samples in multiwell plates with fresh samples in a semi-static manner, as a potential solution to overcome these limitations. In this study, we developed a simple and low-cost, versatile pipetting robot constructed partly using open-source hardware that has a small footprint and can be used for online monitoring of water quality by means of an automated whole-organism bioassay. We tested its precision in automated 2-fold dilution series and used it for exposure of zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio)–a common model species in ecotoxicology—to cadmium chloride and permethrin. We found that, compared to conventional static or semi-static exposure scenarios, effects of the two chemicals in zebrafish embryos generally occurred at lower concentrations, and analytically verified that the increased frequency of media exchange resulted in a greater availability of the chemical. In combination with advanced detection systems this custom-made pipetting robot has the potential to become a valuable tool in future monitoring strategies for drinking and surface water. © 2017 Steffens et al.

AB  - This paper elucidates the design and implementation of a low-cost wireless intelligent two hand gesture recognition system. The proposed system consists of a primary and secondary sub-system which work in tandem to recognize static gestures signed by the user. Each of the sub-systems consists of a sensory glove, embedded with custom made, low-cost flex and contact sensors interfaced with a ATMega328 microcontroller. The two sub-systems are wirelessly inter-connected through a pair of TI's CC2541 Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) modules. The system recognizes gestures with the help of a Dual-mode Intelligent Agent (DIA) which operates in Identification Mode (IM) and intelligently switches to Enhanced Identification Mode (EIM) when the gesture fails to get recognized in IM. The EIM incorporates a Bit Stream Error Elimination (BSEE) algorithm which enhances the gesture recognition accuracy without the addition of any external hardware. The performance of the system was evaluated using a data set comprising of 196 static gestures from eight globally used sign languages. The system efficiency was found to be 80.06% in IM and was enhanced to 93.16% in EIM. The cost of the proposed system in prototype stage is USD 22, which the authors believe could be realized at under USD 10 on commercialization. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - One of the biggest challenges faced by Computer Science undergraduate courses is to create challenging and stimulating learning environment for their students. As a part of Software Engineering focused on innovation, Agile development allows teachers to experiment new ways to transform their students' knowledge. Practitioners of this discipline often prefer to use participative approaches than the traditional passive methods. In this work, we want to go a little further. Instead of presenting one more Agile Development learning method through software, this paper describes the experience of teaching Agile Methods through an Open Hardware project. We hope to contribute to Agile teachers, so they can take advantage of the exciting hardware world to innovate their teaching methods. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - This paper is on free and open source software architecture (FOSS) for remote labs in order to address the affordability and scalability of robotic education technology for sustainable deployments. The proposed Raspberry Pi-Arduino-based model architecture ensures lower cost while allowing some scalability, interoperability, portability and interchangeability to the low-cost online laboratory. Remotely controlled lab provides training skills in bio-inspired robotics. Our previous studies had shown that the implementation of remotely controlled online labs in the curriculum improved active learning among students, collaboration, and augmented problem solving skills. The preliminary implementation involved proprietary software, as the remote experiment accessibility platform, which was later replaced with FOSS technology. The advantages with FOSS included a significantly lower cost and scalability for concurrent usage. The paper also reports on usage analysis and common issues in both cases of implementations. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Cyber-Physical Production System (CPSS) and Service Provisioning are two inevitable trends and challenges for factories of the future. Existing literature in the Internet of Things (IoT) landscape detail opportunities and difficulties, but performance data to evaluate the overheads and suitability of services provisioning for industrial applications is not readily available. So, we designed and developed a General Telematic Framework for Rapid Application Development using Service-Oriented Architectural (SOA) principles and then provisioned services used in typical CPSS environments on embedded Raspberry Pi hardware modules. Performance profiling demonstrates the suitability for Industry-grade CPSS applications. Other applications such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicle search and rescue, Vehicular Tracking, and distributed management systems are also possible with OSGi-based, embedded telematics system. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Infrastructure monitoring applications currently lack a cost-effective and reliable solution for supporting the last communication hop for low-power devices. The use of cellular infrastructure requires contracts and complex radios that are often too power hungry and cost prohibitive for sensing applications that require just a few bits of data each day. New low-power, sub-GHz, long-range radios are an ideal technology to help fill this communication void by providing access points that are able to cover multiple kilometers of urban space with thousands of end-point devices. These new Low-Power Wide-Area Networking (LPWAN) platforms provide a cost-effective and highly deployable option that could piggyback off of existing public and private wireless networks (WiFi, Cellular, etc). In this paper, we present OpenChirp, a prototype end-to-end LPWAN architecture built using LoRa Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN) with the goal of simplifying the design and deployment of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices across wide areas like campuses and cities. We present a software architecture that exposes an application layer allowing users to register devices, describe transducer properties, transfer data and retrieve historical values. We define a service model on top of LoRaWAN that acts as a session layer to provide basic encoding and syntax to raw data streams. At the device-level, we introduce and benchmark an open-source hardware platform that uses Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) to help provision LoRa clients that can be extended with custom transducers. We evaluate the system in terms of end-node energy consumption, radio penetration into buildings as well as coverage provided by a network currently deployed at Carnegie Mellon University. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - This paper reflects on the dynamics and practices of building a maker community around a new hardware platform. We examine the factors promoting the successful uptake of a maker platform from two perspectives: first, we investigate the technical and user experience considerations that users identify as the most important. Second, we explore the specific activities that help attract a community and encourage sustained participation. We present an inductive approach based on the case study of Bela, an embedded platform for creating interactive audio systems. The technical design and community building processes are detailed, culminating in a successful crowdfunding campaign. To further understand the community dynamics, the paper also presents an intensive three-day workshop with eight digital musical instrument designers. From observations and interviews, we reflect on the relationship between the platform and the community and offer suggestions for HCI researchers and practitioners interested in establishing their own maker communities.

AB  - Sorting is an extremely important computation kernel that has been accelerated in a lot of fields such as databases, image processing, and genome analysis. Given that advent of Internet of Things (IoT) era due to mobile technology progressions, the future needs a sorting method that is available on any environment, such as not only high performance systems like servers but also low computational performance machines like embedded systems. In this paper, we present an FPGA-based sorting accelerator combining Sorting Network and Merge Sorter Tree, which is customizable by means of tuning design parameters. The proposed FPGA accelerator sorts data sent from a host PC via the PCIe bus, and sends back the fully sorted data sequence to it. We also present a detailed analytical model that accurately estimates the sorting performance. Due to these characteristics, designers can know how fast a developed sorting hardware is in advance and can implement the best one to fulfill the cost and performance constraints. Our experiments show that the proposed hardware achieves up to 19.5x sorting performance, compared with Intel Core i7-3770K operating at 3.50GHz, when sorting 256M 32-bits integer elements. However, this result is limited because of insufficient memory bandwidth. To overcome this problem, we propose a data compression mechanism and the experimental result shows that the sorting hardware with it achieves almost 90% of the estimated performance, while the hardware without it does about 60%. In order to allow every designer to easily and freely use this accelerator, the RTL source code is released as open-source hardware. © 2017 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.

AB  - Isaac Newton famously observed that "if I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants." We propose that this sentiment is a powerful motivation for the "open-source" movement in scientific research, in which creators provide everything needed to replicate a given project online, as well as providing explicit permission for users to use, improve, and share it with others. Here, we write to introduce analytical chemists who are new to the open-source movement to best practices and concepts in this area and to survey the state of open-source research in analytical chemistry. We conclude by considering two examples of open-source projects from our own research group, with the hope that a description of the process, motivations, and results will provide a convincing argument about the benefits that this movement brings to both creators and users. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Implantable neuronal interfaces to the brain are an important keystone for future medical applications. However, entering this field of research is difficult since such an implant requires components from many different areas of technology. Since the complete avoidance of wires is important due to the risk of infections and other long-term problems, means for wirelessly transmitting data and energy are a necessity which adds to the requirements. In recent literature, many high-tech components for such implants are presented with remarkable properties. However, these components are typically not freely available for such a system. Every group needs to re-develop their own solution. This raises the question if it is possible to create a reusable design for an implant and its external base-station, such that it allows other groups to use it as a starting point. In this article, we try to answer this question by presenting a design based exclusively on commercial off-the-shelf components and studying the properties of the resulting system. Following this idea, we present a fully wireless neuronal implant for simultaneously measuring electrocorticography signals at 128 locations from the surface of the brain. All design files are available as open source. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - An open-source 3-D printable laboratory sample rotator mixer is developed here in two variants that allow users to opt for the level of functionality, cost saving and associated complexity needed in their laboratories. First, a laboratory sample rotator is designed and demonstrated that can be used for tumbling as well as gentle mixing of samples in a variety of tube sizes by mixing them horizontally, vertically, or any position in between. Changing the mixing angle is fast and convenient and requires no tools. This device is battery powered and can be easily transported to operate in various locations in a lab including desktops, benches, clean hoods, chemical hoods, cold rooms, glove boxes, incubators or biological hoods. Second, an on-board Arduino-based microcontroller is incorporated that adds the functionality of a laboratory sample shaker. These devices can be customized both mechanically and functionally as the user can simply select the operation mode on the switch or alter the code to perform custom experiments. The open source laboratory sample rotator mixer can be built by non-specialists for under US$30 and adding shaking functionality can be done for under $20 more. Thus, these open source devices are technically superior to the proprietary commercial equipment available on the market while saving over 90% of the costs. © 2016 The Authors

AB  - Automatic feeders are widely used in animal experiments to dispense an accurate amount of food reward for each trial. Several commercial automatic feeders for animal experiments are available which are specific to certain species and food types. However, it would be beneficial for researchers if they could easily build their own experimental feeders customized for their study species, food types, and other experimental considerations. In this paper, we describe an open source experimental feeder using an Arduino microcontroller. The design of the feeder is focused on simplicity to provide a straight-forward building process and allow custom modifications for various requirements. The cost for building this feeder is less than €200 and we have successfully tested our design with three different food types for pigeons, cats, and marmoset monkeys. © 2016 The Authors

AB  - One oft-cited strategy towards sustainability is improving energy efficiency inside public buildings. In this context, the educational buildings sector presents a very interesting and important case for the monitoring and management of buildings, since it addresses both energy and educational issues. In this work, we present and discuss the hardware IoT infrastructure substrate that provides real-time monitoring in multiple school buildings. We believe that such a system needs to follow an open design approach: rely on hardware-agnostic components that communicate over well-defined open interfaces. We present in detail the design of our hardware components, while also providing insights to the overall system design and a first set of results on their operation. The presented hardware components are utilized as the core hardware devices for GAIA, an EU research project aimed at the educational community. As our system has been deployed and tested in several public school buildings in Greece, we also report on its validation. © 2017

AB  - Three-dimensional (3D) printing technology is considered to be a major driving innovation in tissue engineering, since a custom-made manufacturing for patients is essential for tissue and organ generation. Depending on the bio-materials and the applications, various 3D bio-printing technologies are used. A system capable of printing a variety of bio-materials through various methods is required for fabrication of hybrid scaffolds for tissue engineering research. This paper describes the design and integration of a multi-channel 3D bio-printing system at an affordable price based on open source hardware and software. The hardware and software components of the 3D bio-printing system and the process of finding optimal printing conditions are described in the paper. Fabrication of the hybrid scaffold of synthetic polymer and cell loaded hydrogel are presented to validate the performance of the system. © 2017, Korean Society for Precision Engineering and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - We present the design, modelling and characterization in the 2.4 GHz band of a B-shaped antenna consisting of a dual circular loop over a conductor plane. The proposed design is intrinsically unbalanced and features a very good match to a 50 Ω line at resonance, which makes our device essentially plug'n'play for a coaxial cable feed. Another interesting property of the proposed antenna is its simplicity of construction. The antenna has been modelled using the moment method. A prototype resonant at 2.4 GHz has been built and we have measured its impedance in this spectral region. The radiation pattern and the gain at resonance have also been characterized and the device has been shown to provide 6.31 dBi gain. The overall properties of the device make it an excellent option to provide WiFi connectivity when required in open hardware implementations. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - This paper presents a new wireless platform designed for an integrated traffic/flash flood monitoring system. The sensor platform is built around a 32-bit ARM Cortex M4 microcontroller and a 2.4 GHz 802.15.4 ISM compliant radio module. It can be interfaced with fixed traffic sensors, or receive data from vehicle transponders. This platform is specifically designed for solar-powered, low bandwidth, high computational performance wireless sensor network applications. A self-recovering unit is designed to increase reliability and allow periodic hard resets, an essential requirement for sensor networks. A radio monitoring circuitry is proposed to monitor incoming and outgoing transmissions, simplifying software debugging. We illustrate the performance of this wireless sensor platform on complex problems arising in smart cities, such as traffic flow monitoring, machine-learning-based flash flood monitoring or Kalman-filter based vehicle trajectory estimation. All design files have been uploaded and shared in an open science framework, and can be accessed from https://osf.io/fuyqd/. The hardware design is under CERN Open Hardware License v1.2. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - We are surrounded by increasingly complex networks of smart objects, yet our understanding and attachment to themis rather limited. One way to support stronger end users' engagement with such complex technologies is by involving them in the design process and, with the advent of Arduino prototyping platform, even in their making. While DIY practice offers the potential for stronger user engagement with physical artifacts, we know little about end users' DIY practice of making complex electronic technologies and their potential to ensure engagement with such devices. In this article, we report on interviews with 18 participants from two green communities who built and used an open source DIY energy monitor, with the aim to explore the end users DIY practices of making such complex electronic devices. Findings indicate four key qualities of DIY monitors: transparent modularity, open-endedness, heirloom, and disruptiveness, and how they contribute to more meaningful engagement with the DIY monitors, elevating them from the status of unremarkable objects to that of things. We conclude with three implications for design for supporting end user development of complex electronic DIY: designing transparent open hardware technologies, standardizing communication protocols for the current and future DIY of IoT, and deliberately calling for personal investment and labor in the assembling of DIY kits. © 2017 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Much like how mobile phones ceased to be only person-to-person communications devices and became technical platforms, in-vehicle electronic devices will too cease to be solely information devices and become technical platforms incorporating all-encompassing features, including but not limited to ADAS, navigation, communication, and entertainment. This fundamental shift however will require a transformation and redesign of the vehicle's technical architecture. Today, a vehicle's ADAS, communications, and entertainment features exist isolated in separate devices and systems and are purpose built, leading to duplicative functions, increased costs, and difficult control, management, maintenance, and upgrade of the system. This presentation will illustrate a central control system architecture built around an IoV Gateway, an open hardware platform that integrates ICT devices for future vehicles. Not only will this gateway orchestrate the common devices and CMS as a collective unit, this open architecture will allow for scalable, flexible and easy development of 3rd party equipment, such as V2X, and new applications. New modules and/or software applications for additional features, repairs, and upgrades can be added later without changing the existing system. This will reduce development efforts tremendously as the developer can focus on his or her subject matter expertise by adding on the features or applications onto the platform without changing the underlying system. © 2017 SAE International.

AB  - Electrophysiology has recently evolved into an interactive, high-throughput endeavor. Recording from dozens to hundreds of electrodes is today routine; novel means of manipulating the system in real time, through electrical stimulation, optogenetics or sensory manipulation are allowing us to decipher neural circuit function at an unparalleled rate. To contribute to the wide dissemination of such techniques, we present an open hardware project, High-Channel Count Electrophysiology (HiCCE), aiming to produce low-cost, high-channel count (≥128 channels) electrophysiology instrumentation capable of fast data acquisition rates, real-time processing and feedback capabilities. Our design is centered on an open standard, FPGA Mezzanine Card (FMC), which permits a varied choice of FPGA carrier architectures suited to different laboratory experimental needs. The HiCCE-128, a low-cost highperformance 128-channel data acquisition board for small voltage signals, is being introduced. It is a FMC module that can be operated from any FPGA carrier conforming to the FMC/VITA57 standard. This specialized board with a low input referred noise of about 3 μV is capable of acquiring 128 channels simultaneously at 31.25 kS/s per channel with 16 effective bits of resolution. We present the global architecture and some preliminary measurement to illustrate its potential for electrophysiological and medical applications. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - We have designed and developed a robotic car with simple architecture by assembling open source hardware, Bluetooth module and advanced sensors. We have also developed an android application running on a smart phone which monitors and controls the operation of the robot via Bluetooth and can also access the sensors data. The car is programmed with auto obstacle detection and prevention algorithm based on ultrasonic ranging sensor. For monitoring purpose we have considered only temperature and humidity in the present work. But there is provision to connect other sensors too, viz. explosive detector or nuclear radiation detector based on requirement. The digital one wire temperature and humidity sensors are mounted to monitor real time temperature and humidity of the surrounding medium. The data of these parameters are displayed on the android application running remotely. In addition to this, the car is capable of transmitting live streaming video through an IP based Webcam, which helps in remotely monitoring and controlling the movement. The system has a provision of storing the data and retrieving it from the online database for analysis. In this paper we have discussed the hardware design, software aspects and test results of the system. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper, we study code clones in hardware description languages (HDLs) in comparison with general programming languages. For this purpose, we have developed a method for detecting code clones in Verilog HDL. A key idea of the proposed method is to convert the Verilog HDL code into the pseudo C++ code, which is then processed by an existing code clone detector for C++. We conducted an experiment on 10 open source hardware products described in Verilog HDL, where we succeeded in detecting nearly 1,800 clone sets with approximately 80% precision. We compared code clones in Verilog HDL with those in Java/C based on the metrics to identify the differences among languages. We identified patterns on how code clones are created in Verilog HDL, which include cases for increasing stability and capability of parallel processing of the circuit. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - The Internet of Things, or the IoT, is an emerging, disruptive technology that enables physical devices to communicate across disparate networks. IP has been the de facto standard for seamless interconnectivity in the traditional Internet; and piggybacking on the success of IP, 6LoWPAN has been the first standardized technology to realize it for networks of resource-constrained devices. In the recent past Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) a.k.a Bluetooth Smart - a subset of the Bluetooth v4.0 and the latest v4.2 stack, has surfaced as an appealing alternative, with many competing advantages over available low-power communication technologies in the IoT space such as IEEE 802.15.4. However, BLE is a closed standard and lacks open hardware and firmware support, something that hinders innovation and development in this field. In this article, we aim to overcome some of the constraints in BLE's core building blocks by making three contributions: first, we present the design of a new open hardware platform for BLE; second, we provide a Contiki O.S. port for the new platform; and third, we identify research challenges and opportunities in 6LoWPAN-connected Bluetooth Smart. We believe that the knowledge and insights will facilitate IoT innovations based on this promising technology. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this era of wireless engineering, Open source application has turned out to be an evolving concept in the development of GSM technology. Nowadays, GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) networks are receiving increasing attention in the open-source community. Hence, aim of this paper is to illustrate the process of implementation of autonomous GSM BTS (Base Transceiver Station) by using OSH (Open Source Hardware) such as BladeRF device, a multipurpose signal processing board used for Software Defined Radio (SDR) and YateBTS, an OSS (Open Source Software) acts as a GSM access point which is software based. Generally, YateBTS permits available standard GSM phone to be employed as SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) endpoints in VoIP (voice over IP) network system. An experimental study has been conducted to test the feasibility and effectiveness of the implemented system. The outcome of experimental result is thoroughly examined in this paper. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Mobile robots are valuable tools for education because of both the enthusiasm they raise and the multidisciplinary nature of robotics technology. Mobile robots give access to a wide range of fields, such as complex mechanics, sensors, wireless transmission, mathematics, and computer science. However, despite their potential as educational tools, robots are still not as widespread in schools as they could be. In this article, we identify five key reasons: lack of diversity, high cost, noninclusive design, lack of educational material, and lack of stability over time. Then, we describe our answers to these problems, as we implemented them in the Thymio project: a mature mass-produced open-hardware robot, at a low price, with a multiage and gender-neutral feature set, and with a design promoting creativity, facilitating learning, and providing a wide range of interaction possibilities from built-in behaviors to text programming, passing through different visual programming environments. We highlight some neglected key issues that differentiate open-source hardware from open-source software, for instance the legal uncertainty of designing open hardware using professional computer-aided design (CAD) tools and the difficulty to distribute the development. Our solution to these being to increase the awareness of CAD editors to open-source hardware and to provide a two-layer development model for hardware. © 1994-2011 IEEE.

AB  - One of the chief obstacles in achieving wider acceptance of robotics is that only experienced roboticists can develop robotics applications. If we want robots in our homes and offices, we need more tools and platforms that reduce the costs in time and money of prototyping robots. The open-source paradigm offers a potential solution to these key factors. However, creating open-source robotics hardware does not mean just making the design files available online. It is essential to design the hardware in such a way that it can be built and modified by nonexpert users. © 1994-2011 IEEE.

AB  - The articles in this special section focus on the open-source movement taking over the robotics industry. Open source systems have already revolutionized a number of industries by empowering end users to contribute to the products that they need and want and by fueling grass-roots development and continual improvement of projects in completely new areas. While there have been innumerable successes in software and electronics hardware, open mechanical hardware is taking longer to catch on. There are a number of likely reasons for this, including the complexity, expense, and time associated with fabricating mechanical components as well as the challenge and reliability of assembling the wide range of mechanical and electronic components required to produce a fully functional system. In comparison with open-source software efforts, open hardware has numerous additional practical challenges associated with dissemination and evolution of the product driven by end users. However, rapid fabrication technologies have improved to the point of being able to produce parts that are strong, robust, and precise enough for practical robotic systems, and the pricing of the systems and supplies have lowered to the point that many of these machines are available in fabrication facilities at most universities. © 1994-2011 IEEE.

AB  - In this study, we introduce a modulation strategy for comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC×GC) by using a simple and consumable-free modulator. This “Do-It-Yourself” interface comprised a 1.0 m×0.25 mm segment of MTX-5 metallic column and a low-cost DC power supply. Thermal desorption modulation (TDM) was attained using a dual-stage heater-based modulator in a novel segmented-loop configuration. TDM was achieved by alternating analyte trapping and thermal desorption. Former process relied on analyte partition to sorbent phase, while latter explored direct resistive heating. Introduction of an intermediate delay segment between the two stages mitigated analyte breakthrough, improving peak symmetry and chromatographic efficiency. This feature was critical to acquire reliable GC×GC modulation using such simple heater-based device. The effects of important modulation variables on 2D separations were investigated, including TDM stage length, dimension of delay loop, and outlet pressure. Significant advances and limitations of proposed TDM strategy were carefully determined. Proposed GC×GC prototype by using an in-oven TDM modulator was successfully applied to a series of challenging matrices, including petroleum distillates, biodiesel, and essential oil. This open-hardware, cost-effective modulator was easy to install and operate, as it circumvented the need for sophisticated components (e.g. moving parts and cooling systems). Therefore, our modulator is a compelling alternative to existing GC×GC solutions to operate in resource-limited laboratories. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A method for directly measuring carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions using a mobile sensor network in cities at fine spatial resolution was developed and tested. First, a compact, mobile system was built using an infrared gas analyzer combined with open-source hardware to control, georeference, and log measurements of CO2 mixing ratios on vehicles (car, bicycles). Second, two measurement campaigns, one in summer and one in winter (heating season) were carried out. Five mobile sensors were deployed within a 1×12.7 km transect across the city of Vancouver, BC, Canada. The sensors were operated for 3.5 h on pre-defined routes to map CO2 mixing ratios at street level, which were then averaged to 100×100m grid cells. The averaged CO2 mixing ratios of all grids in the study area were 417.9 ppm in summer and 442.5 ppm in winter. In both campaigns, mixing ratios were highest in the grid cells of the downtown core and along arterial roads and lowest in parks and well vegetated residential areas. Third, an aerodynamic resistance approach to calculating emissions was used to derive CO2 emissions from the gridded CO2 mixing ratio measurements in conjunction with mixing ratios and fluxes collected from a 28m tall eddycovariance tower located within the study area. These measured emissions showed a range of -12 to 226CO2 ha-1 h-1 in summer and of -14 to 163 kgCO2 ha-1 h-1 in winter, with an average of 35.1 kgCO2 ha-1 h-1 (summer) and 25.9 kgCO2 ha-1 h-1 (winter). Fourth, an independent emissions inventory was developed for the study area using buildings energy simulations from a previous study and routinely available traffic counts. The emissions inventory for the same area averaged to 22.06 kgCO2 ha-1 h-1 (summer) and 28.76 kgCO2 ha-1 h-1 (winter) and was used to compare against the measured emissions from the mobile sensor network. The comparison on a grid-by-grid basis showed linearity between CO2 mixing ratios and the emissions inventory (R2 = 0:53 in summer and R2 = 0:47 in winter). Also, 87% (summer) and 94% (winter) of measured grid cells show a difference within ±1 order of magnitude, and 49% (summer) and 69% (winter) show an error of less than a factor 2. Although associated with considerable errors at the individual grid cell level, the study demonstrates a promising method of using a network of mobile sensors and an aerodynamic resistance approach to rapidly map greenhouse gases at high spatial resolution across cities. The method could be improved by longer measurements and a refined calculation of the aerodynamic resistance. © Author(s) 2017.

AB  - This paper proposes a methodology for learning of languages programming using open hardware tools. It has chosen as study case, the teaching of Python language due to versatility, structure and robustness that this language provides in the design and construction of hardware and software elements in devices such as Arduino or Raspberry PI. However, this methodology can be employed in the teaching of other type of programming languages such as C, Java, or Dart. It has selected as educational framework of the methodology some sections of the model known as Stage Self Direct Learning (SSDL) which provides a conceptual base that serves as reference model allowing to build a methodology in which the students will be participant of their own educational process. In order to enhance the learning process in the students, in the structure of course, it has designed an e-learning course taking as platform to ILIAS (Integriertes Lern-, Informations- und Arbeitskooperations- System). It is an open source platform with some features such as Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) resources, forums, surveys, taxonomy services, exercises and assessment. During the development of course, different kinds of resources were created and shared through this platform, these were subject to discussion providing a space for the exchange of ideas and experiences associated with the main topics of this course. The methodology established allowed to encourage the interest of the students in the learning and use of programming languages as likewise using them in the design of projects that require the use of open hardware resources. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Innovative and quality education for all is a major precondition for smart nations. Children and youth are fascinated by mechanisms, machines and robots. Therefore, robotics using inexpensive open source hardware and software is increasingly being used in innovative STEM education. But, developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America are well behind the curve in the use of robots in schools and colleges. An innovative and extremely affordable robotic system is developed in this paper, whereby school children anywhere can go online and race multiple indoor mobile robots over the Internet. Virtual reality and force feedback are used to make the racing realistic and interactive. Children will be introduced to building their own inexpensive mobile robots using commercial, off-the-shelf components and materials. Advanced learners, e.g., college and university students, can modify and improve the hardware and software for Internet-based teleoperation. The project can be used to introduce or improve robotics education at a low cost among school children, while providing opportunities in service learning for college/university students. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - A portable probe based on open hardware architecture for the assessment of soil thermal properties and water content using the DPHP method is presented. The mean percentage errors for assessment of volumetric heat capacity and thermal conductivity were 4.6% and 8.9% respectively, computed after sensor spacing calibration in agar stabilized water. The DPHP probe has been tested for soil thermal properties assessment and compared to TDR probe for the water content estimation in four different soils. The DPHP probe showed an accuracy comparable to TDR in estimating water content, with DPHP showing lower values of error index in 3 samples out of 4. The DPHP can be used to investigate smaller volume of soil than TDR probe can do however, TDR is much faster than DPHP in measure acquisition. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A highly versatile Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) system, nicknamed the ScouseTom, has been developed. The system allows control over current amplitude, frequency, number of electrodes, injection protocol and data processing. Current is injected using a Keithley 6221 current source, and voltages are recorded with a 24-bit EEG system with minimum bandwidth of 3.2 kHz. Custom PCBs interface with a PC to control the measurement process, electrode addressing and triggering of external stimuli. The performance of the system was characterised using resistor phantoms to represent human scalp recordings, with an SNR of 77.5 dB, stable across a four hour recording and 20 Hz to 20 kHz. In studies of both haeomorrhage using scalp electrodes, and evoked activity using epicortical electrode mats in rats, it was possible to reconstruct images matching established literature at known areas of onset. Data collected using scalp electrode in humans matched known tissue impedance spectra and was stable over frequency. The experimental procedure is software controlled and is readily adaptable to new paradigms. Where possible, commercial or open-source components were used, to minimise the complexity in reproduction. The hardware designs and software for the system have been released under an open source licence, encouraging contributions and allowing for rapid replication. © 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Computer science (CS) is becoming an increasingly diverse domain. This paper reports on an initiative designed to introduce underrepresented populations to computing using an eclectic, multifaceted approach. As part of a yearlong computing course, students engage in Maker activities, participatory simulations, and computing projects that foreground the social and collaborative aspects of CS. Collectively, these activities are designed to introduce learners to the growing diversity of what CS looks like in the 21st century. This paper lays out the practical and theoretical motivations for the Computational Thinking for Girls (CT4G) project, specifically highlighting the use of Making through physical and social computing as ways to engage students in CS. A snapshot of one activity from the program is provided - Wearing the Web - in which students use open-hardware programmable badges to explore the underlying structure and technology that enables the Internet. Data from the first year of the CT4G program are presented to show the positive effects that this diverse introduction to CS is having on the students with respect to their attitudes toward CS. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - KdUINO buoy, a moored citizen science system with low-cost sensors is based on the open hardware platform Arduino and quasi digital optical light sensors that measure a parameter related to water transparency, the diffuse attenuation coefficient. The buoy also has a real-time clock and an SD memory card to save data and the time of the measurements. Volunteers tested KdUINOs in Canada and Antarctica. They did some preliminary tests with KdUINOs where they compared light diffuse attenuation coefficient between Ramsey Lake and Lake Laurentian. Ramsey Lake has depths up to 100 m, a diverse population of fish and normal pH for the boreal region of Canada. KdUINO was deployed through fall freeze and left in place until spring melt through winter 2015, with atmospheric temperatures down to -20° C during the winter, and it worked properly under these freezing weather conditions. The preliminary tests concluded that Ramsey Lake was found to have a Kd about six times lower than Lake Laurentian, indicating, as expected, that Ramsey Lake is much more transparent than Lake Laurentian. In Antarctica, taking advantage of the annual research campaigns of the Hesperides vessel, a volunteer, who was a technician of the ship, made measurements using the KdUINO at 60° S and 61° S. The temperature of the water/air of the sampling points was 1.5° C and -2° C. light diffuse attenuation coefficient values obtained are within the expected values in this region.

AB  - In 2012 the Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica opened the Computer Engineering program at the recently created Centro Academico de Alajuela. By that time there were neither research space nor resources available for undergraduate students to practice problem solving by applying theoretical concepts to real life problems. The Laboratorio Experimental was proposed on mid 2013 as a research initiative where students and faculty could engage together in projects powered by low cost open hardware and free software. This article shares the experiences learned by the proponents of the lab after two years of operation. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - The advent and wide deployment of open-source hardware, open-source software and 3D printing enabled people to make things instead of purchasing or acquiring complete products. The authors defined such activities as 'ICT DIY' with the hopes of spreading and disseminating DIY culture, that will, in turn, further popularize the ICT-based maker ecosystem. In this sense, the authors have developed a number of ICT DIY standards since 2014 to provide guidance to makers especially non-professionals. We have also and had open discussions with international experts to share best practices and raise awareness on ICT DIY in ITU-T. In this paper, the empirical impact of ICT DIY standards towards the actual industry in South Korea is studied and analyzed. The analysis is followed by the discussion of the relationship between ICT DIY and IoT, and the general requirements for how ICT DIY can act as a facilitator to realize the hyper-connected society. The authors concluded by providing implications of the development of ICT DIY and its future impacts. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - There are several specific solutions for accessing sensors and actuators present in any process or system through a TCP/IP network, either local or a wide area type like the Internet. The usage of sensors and actuators of different nature and diverse interfaces (SPI, I2C, analogue, etc.) makes access to them from a network in a homogeneous and secure way more complex. A framework, including both software and hardware resources, is necessary to simplify and unify networked access to these devices. In this paper, a set of open-source software tools, specifically designed to cover the different issues concerning the access to sensors and actuators, and two proposed low-cost hardware architectures to operate with the abovementioned software tools are presented. They allow integrated and easy access to local or remote sensors and actuators. The software tools, integrated in the free authoring tool Easy Java and Javascript Simulations (EJS) solve the interaction issues between the subsystem that integrates sensors and actuators into the network, called convergence subsystem in this paper, and the Human Machine Interface (HMI)—this one designed using the intuitive graphical system of EJS—located on the user’s computer. The proposed hardware architectures and software tools are described and experimental implementations with the proposed tools are presented. © 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Technical progress in production technology, the advancement and spread of information and communication technologies (ICT) as well as the spill-over of the highly efficient and innovative open source principles to the world of physical products represent a new set of tools and concepts to address the challenges of sustainable economic development. Correspondingly, we can observe (new) modes of value creation that put into question traditional economic strategies and assumptions by stressing collaboration instead of competition and knowledge sharing instead of black box engineering. Open Source Ecology (OSE) is a famous example of a nonprofit organization which fosters worldwide participation and collaboration to jointly develop open source hardware for operation in both developing and industrialized countries. Based on the concepts open source appropriate technology (OSAT), the community aims at the free access to the knowledge and knowhow of low-cost and easy-to-build products to empower people to build and run a civilization. This case study describes and analyzes the value creation processes of OSE and derives new opportunities for business models based on openness. © 2016 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology, Inc.

AB  - In this paper, we propose an implementation method of the real-time tracking control system for a two-wheeled mobile robot. The proposed tracking control system is structured so that the target velocities are generated using the reference generated by the realtime path generator and current posture information of the robot. Two PI controllers are used to track he target velocities. The proposed realtime path generator generates SPP (single polar polynomial) curves for the curved path and can handle the speed and acceleration constraints of the actuators of the mobile robot. The proposed path generator does not need to store the entire path information over time. It computes and saves the minimum information required to generate the path offline and generates all path references in real-time. The proposed method is implemented in Arduino Due, which is an open source hardware, and applied to a lab-built mobile to demonstrate that the proposed tracking control system can be implemented on a small scale system such as a microcontroller. © ICROS 2017.

AB  - In this paper, we propose an implementation method for a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulator for an inverted pendulum system using low cost open-source hardware. We adopted the Arch Max (ARM Cortex-M4-based open-source hardware) as an HIL simulator platform. Using the nested vectored interrupt controller (NVIC) mechanism of the Cortex-M4 core, we assigned three interrupts with different priorities to handle three parts of the HIL simulator. The model equation of the inverted pendulum system was solved in real-time using the Runge-Kutta method in a timer interrupt service routine. An input capture interrupt-based method was used to simulate the motor drive by converting the duty ratio of pulse width modulation (PWM) signals into the voltage level applied to a DC motor. To simulate incremental rotary encoders, which are two sensors for the inverted pendulum system, a timer interrupt-based quadrature pulse generation algorithm was presented and to generate the quadrature pulse more accurately, an error compensation method was also provided. Finally, animation functionality to give a visual indication of how the controller is progressing was implemented through Vpython. Through experiments, we illustrated that the proposed HIL simulator successfully simulates the real inverted pendulum and is useful for teaching students about designing a working controller through programming embedded devices. © ICROS 2017.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a remote control and monitoring system using the Raspberry Pi as an IoT device. The proposed system has the following features. First, various sensor information can be acquired through Arduino Due's rich peripherals. Second, the acquired information is delivered to a PC through Ethernet communication of Raspberry Pi, which is an IoT device. Third, easy use is supported through a lab-built user interface. In the proposed system, the acquisition of sensor information and processing of control commands are performed on Arduino Due, and the measured information is designed to be transmitted to Raspberry Pi through SPI communication. A lab-built GUI program is introduced to efficiently display the received the sensor information on a PC efficiently. To illustrate the usefulness of the proposed system, an HILS (hardware-inthe- loop simulator), which simulates the greenhouse phenomenon, is implemented using Arduino Nano. The entire proposed system is implemented using open-source hardware and can be easily deployed at low cost.

AB  - In recent years, many internet of things (IoT) platforms based on cloud computing have been proposed for general purpose applications. Though many similar platforms or schemes particular for smart home applications have been proposed, many issues such as multiple connectivity due to diversity of smart home applications and supporting for real-time operations have not been solved properly. We propose a smart home foundation scheme adopting open source hardware devices and cloud computing technology to explore these issues. In this scheme, Arduino Yun-based smart hardware devices can connect to the cloud server through multiply network connectivity. By utilising Spacebrew technology, a bidirectional real-time communication can be implemented which provides a solid foundation for real-time operations of smart home. The core functions of the scheme are exposed through RESTful web services in a SaaS (short for software as a service) manner and can be called by various clients and other applications. Demonstrative applications show that the proposed smart home foundation scheme provides adequate support for creating smart home applications based on wireless open source hardware devices.

AB  - Following the successful adoption of the open source model in the software realm, open source is becoming a new design paradigm in hardware development. Open source models for tangible products are still in its infancy, and many studies are required to demonstrate its application to for-profit product development. It is an alluring question why entrepreneurs decide to use an open model to develop their products under risks and unknowns, such as infringement and community management. The goal of this paper is to investigate the motivations of entrepreneurs of open source hardware companies. The leaders and founders of twentythree companies were interviewed to understand their motivation and experiences in creating a company based on open source hardware. Based on these interviews, we generated a hierarchical framework to explain these motivations, where each level of the framework has been defined, explained and illustrated with representative quotes. The motivations of open source action are framed by two categories in the paper: 1) Intrinsic Motivation, which describes the motivations of an entrepreneur as an individual, who needs personal satisfaction, enjoyment as well as altruism and reciprocity; 2) Extrinsic Motivation, which describes motivations of an entrepreneur whose identity is as a for-profit company leader. © 2017 ASME.

AB  - The Fundación Universitaria Católica Lumen Gentium, UNICATÓLICA, is a higher education institution in Santiago de Cali, Valle del Cauca with twenty years of service, providing quality instruction to vulnerable communities in the region. The training process corresponding to the engineering area presents weaknesses regarding the fundamentals of electronics, particularly when trying to address issues of industrial automation and robotics. Due to this, we have taken advantage of the free hardware and software tools available as well as collaborative work applications, which provide a wide range of devices that allow us to create functional and quality developments in this area, to contribute to the professional training of UNICATOLICA engineers and supporting the processes of open science and knowledge dissemination. In this paper we gather practical experiences at a research level in UNICATOLICA, describing the tools used and the structure of the projects, their scope and perspectives. This way, we set an institutional precedent in the learning process of our engineering students. Copyright © 2017 Authors' names.

AB  - The driving force for the advancement in the popularity of 3D printing in the education market is that 3D printers have become more affordable to purchase commercially and even more so when constructed utilizing open-source hardware and when operated using open-source software. As predicted by Campbell et al. (2012), the future of additive manufacturing (AM) from the perspective of three key elements: applications, materials, and design is that as the primary patents expire medium cost, AM hardware developed will foster an increased market demand which in turn will accelerate the rate of entry-level suppliers into the market with new and improved materials. Commercially, a high risk aspect of the business is hardware improvements plus the software maintenance and development, which in an open-source environment is passed on to the open-source community that collectively strive to improve upon previous versions. © 2017 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is a promising technology for the implementing of high-performance and power-efficient cloud computing by serving dedicated hardware as co-processor to accelerate loads on CPUs. However, developing an FPGA-based system is challenging because the complexity of the hardware and software co-design. In this paper, we propose a platform named hCODE to simplify the design, share, and deployment of FPGA accelerators. First, we adopt a shell-and-IP design pattern to improve the reusability and the portability of accelerator designs. Second, we implement an open accelerator repository to bridge hardware development and software development on one platform. On the hCODE platform, hardware developers can provide designs that follow hCODE specifications, which allowing software engineers to easily search, download, and integrate accelerators in their applications without caring about the hardware details. © 2017 Information Processing Society of Japan

AB  - A portable infrared scanner is a valuable tool in household application & small business, ranging from product integrity check to housing infrastructure maintenance. We want to extend the usability of portable infrared scanners and introduce remote sensing techniques to the products listed on the market made only possible by recent progress in consumer grade UAV and open source hardware like Raspberry Pi. To introduce the insights from Remote Sensing to the daily life of the general population and help manage small-scale agricultural and forestry activities, we need first lower the bar in both platform and hardware cost while maintaining a high degree of user control and flexibility. In this paper, we make a general discussion about the design and construct of such system using compact open source computers like Raspberry Pi and conduct a preliminary test of the camera system with test shoots, image fusion in aide of direct interpretation to further deduct the feasibility of such system.

AB  - In this position paper, we present the design and implementation of an in-home sensor agent as an Internet of Things (IoT) smart device system based on an open hardware architecture. This sensor agent is designed to be connected to a wireless network in the target individual's home where it collects trigger information from various switches, motion detection sensors in the room, along with the pillow and bed. We began our study by conducting a complete requirement analysis to determine the functions required for the home sensors. Next, we examined the proposed system terms of its hardware and software requirements and fabricated working prototypes. Here, it should be noted that the hardware and software were designed to aggregate connections with various composite sensor devices in order to allow trigger collection and processing. Finally, we reviewed visualization techniques for displaying the analytical results of the monitoring under normal conditions and emergency situations. © Copyright 2017 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

AB  - Open hardware platforms are gaining wide popularity in various fields of technology for their accessibility and inexpensiveness. Although availability of these platforms is undeniable, the performance of these machines in handling tasks which require execution within critical time constraints is still in question. Moreover, technical documentation and support for open hardware are scarce in comparison to expensive commercially distributed platforms. In this paper, we present a detailed process to implement embedded Linux and the real-time extension of Xenomai to two popular open embedded hardware, BeagleBone Black and i. MX6Q SABRELite. Also, we analyze the response time of real-time mechanisms and its performance for inter-task communication (ITC) between real-time tasks. Response time of real-time mechanisms is an important measure to predict the realtime performance of each platform. The performance evaluation is performed both in kernel space and user space using the metrics of jitter, to estimate the periodicity of the cyclic task, and execution time of three real-time mechanisms including semaphore, message queue, and message pipe. The results of this study would serve as a guideline in developing real-time systems on low cost open embedded hardware platforms using the real-time Linux extension of Xenomai.

AB  - To analyse user behaviour and energy consumption data in contemporary and future households, we need to monitor electrical appliance features as well as ambient appliance features. For this purpose, a distributed measurement system is required, which measures the entire power consumption of the household, the power consumption of selected household appliances, and the effect of these appliances on their environment. In this paper we present a distributed measurement system that records and monitors electrical household appliances. Our low-cost measurement system integrates the YaY smart meter, a set of smart plugs, and several networked ambient sensors. In conjunction with energy advisor tools the presented measurement system provides an efficient low-cost alternative to commercial energy monitoring systems by surpassing them with machine learning techniques, appliance identification methods, and applications based on load disaggregation. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Scientists have begun using self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) 3-D printers to manufacture open source digital designs of scientific equipment. This approach is refined here to develop a novel instrument capable of performing automated large-area four-point probe measurements. The designs for conversion of a RepRap 3-D printer to a 2-D open source four-point probe (OS4PP) measurement device are detailed for the mechanical and electrical systems. Free and open source software and firmware are developed to operate the tool. The OS4PP was validated against a wide range of discrete resistors and indium tin oxide (ITO) samples of different thicknesses both pre- and post-annealing. The OS4PP was then compared to two commercial proprietary systems. Results of resistors from 10 to 1 MΩ show errors of less than 1% for the OS4PP. The 3-D mapping of sheet resistance of ITO samples successfully demonstrated the automated capability to measure non-uniformities in large-area samples. The results indicate that all measured values are within the same order of magnitude when compared to two proprietary measurement systems. In conclusion, the OS4PP system, which costs less than 70% of manual proprietary systems, is comparable electrically while offering automated 100 micron positional accuracy for measuring sheet resistance over larger areas. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - The bending stiffness of the wind turbine blades has decreased due to the trend of wind turbine upsizing. Consequently, the risk of blades breakage by hitting the tower has increased. In order to prevent such incidents, this study proposes a deflection monitoring system that can be installed to already operating wind turbine's blades. The monitoring system is composed of an estimation algorithm to detect blade deflection and a wireless sensor network as a hardware equipment. As for the estimation method for blade deflection, a strain-based estimation algorithm and an objective function for optimal sensor arrangement are proposed. Strain-based estimation algorithm is using a linear correlation between strain and deflections, which can be expressed in a form of a transformation matrix. The objective function includes the terms of strain sensitivity and condition number of the transformation matrix between strain and deflection. In order to calculate the objective function, a simplified experimental model of the blade is constructed by interpolating the mode shape of a blade from modal testing. The interpolation method is effective considering a practical use to operating wind turbines' blades since it is not necessary to establish a finite element model of a blade. On the other hand, a sensor network with wireless connection with an open source hardware is developed. It is installed to a 300 W scale wind turbine and vibration of the blade on operation is investigated. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The ability to monitor the health of complex structures such as aeronautic or civil engineering structures in real time is becoming increasingly important. This process is referred to as structural health monitoring (SHM) and relies on onboard platforms comprising sensors, computational units, communication resources, and sometimes actuators. Many of such platforms have been developed within the last years but there is still a lack of structuration and knowledge exchange regarding the software and hardware architectures of such platforms. The aim of the present paper is to introduce an open hardware and open software platform dedicated to SHM within the fields of aeronautics and civil engineering. The platform presented here will be made available in an open hardware and open source framework to allow SHM researchers to run concurrent detection, localization, classification or quantification algorithms using simple interpreted languages such as Python.

AB  - Currently, the water crisis is not only visible in Brazil but almost everywhere and it arises where water scarcity becomes a global challenge or environmental concerns about the shortage of drinking water. The need to have water available for consumption is critical, since, in turn, it is the main source for life on Earth. Despite all of Earth’s water found, only 2.5% of it is freshwater. From this smallest part, 70% of it is used in agriculture, 23% by industries and 7% for human consumption. This paper presents an embedded system prototype for air dehumidifying which has the main purpose of obtaining water (by means of condensation). Others benefits include low cost, low size, portability and an Internet of Things application approach. The dehumidifier uses an aluminum plate around 36 cm2 and about 0.5 mm thickness, a thermoelectric Peltier tablet, a breadboard UNO R3 arduino, wires jumper, transistors TIP122 and 1 KΩ (Ohm) resistors. Within the initial results, we verified the condensed water in the aluminum and the formation of water repeatedly and controlled. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - Due to proliferation in the metropolitan areas there existing problem of poor traffic congestion has grown at alarming event and it is not easy to find the stolen vehicles. So here we use Theft vehicle detection system for finding the theft vehicles using open source hardware of RASPBERRY PI.This system make use of RFID and embedded technology. Here each vehicle is placed with RFID tag. Whenever the RFID reader reads the RFID tag in the stolen vehicle it alert the traffic police and the signal will be automatically changed into red light until the vehicle is recovered from the stolen person. This is achieved by connecting cloud technology with server which is handle by the traffic police. When the traffic controller ensures that the particular vehicle is missed then, whenever that particular vehicle crossed by the any signal red light blinks automatically then cloud displays the message with vehicle number.By using this system, we can alert the signal and can easily find the stolen vehicle by tracking the RFID tag. © 2017, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

AB  - Maker Education is a practice-oriented movement that has risen in the last decade, and emphasizes more on innovation, creativity and problem solving. Maker Education is based on knowledge, directed by creation, and is aimed at solving problems. This study, aimed at the curriculum of the Department of Information Management, expects to develop a systematic information Maker curriculum. This curriculum, combined with the 3D printing machine and Arduino open hardware configured with the STEM education framework, is designed to explore the impact of the introduction of Maker education to information curriculum of technical or vocational colleges on attitude differences and learning of STEM. Two courses, 3D model design and Arduino programming, are implemented, after the end of which, students’ achievements are evaluated. The result is that male still have higher interests in science, engineering and technology than women, but Maker curriculum is multifaceted and foundational so that many people can spend a little time in learning and use various skills to produce their own works. Therefore, there is little difference between women and men in scores of achievement test. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - The number of disposable molecular diagnostics tests in the IVD market has been growing rapidly and is bound to continue to grow in the near future. The internal complexity of these rapid tests increases with the complexity of the diagnostic assay implemented by them. Some assays require precise temperature control (±1°C–5°C) for an extended time (i.e. 15–60 minutes) for the reactions involved to run properly. Microheating components in them must meet strict criteria with respect to power consumption, physical size and cost. The proposed finite element model is intended to provide tools for in silico validation of device designs (geometries, structural materials), as well as to help in the interpretation of heat transfer processes inside the thermal system present in a molecular diagnostics device. The proposed model was developed for and validated with polyimide etched foil heating elements actively controlled via a mini-thermostat. The thermostat was designed for battery-based operation and implemented with open-source hardware (Arduino-compatible). Plastic test structures were created that emulated disposable Lab-on-a-Chip devices with microfluidic channels to hold liquid volumes on the scale of 0.1 mL. The experimental setup was demonstrated to maintain target temperatures over at least 30 minutes with at least ±1°C around the set point operated from batteries. Physical parameters of the resistive heating element used were fed into the finite element model and simulation results compared to the performance of the aforementioned experimental setup. © 2017 WIT Press.

AB  - This paper designs and implements a smart garden system that can be used inside the house. To do this, we used particle filter and environmental sensors, which are open hardware controllers, and designed to control and observe automatic water supply, lighting, and growth monitoring with three wireless systems (Bluetooth, Ethernet, Wi-Fi). This system has been developed to make it possible to use it in an indoor space such as an apartment, rather than a large-scale cultivation system such as a conventional plant factory which has already been widely used. The developed system collects environmental data by using soil sensor, illuminance sensor, humidity sensor and temperature sensor as well as control through smartphone app, analyzes the collected data, and controls water pump, LED lamp, air ventilation fan and so on. As a wireless remote control method, we implemented Bluetooth, Ethernet and Wi-Fi. Finally, it is designed for users to enable remote control and monitoring when the user is not in the house. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - Open source frameworks have enabled widespread access to desktop-scale additive manufacturing technology and software, but very few highly hackable large-scale or industrial open source equipment platorms exist. As research trajectories contnue to move towards large-scale experimentation and full-scale building construction in robotc and digital fabrication, access to industrial fabrication equipment is critcal. Large-scale digital fabrication equipment usually requires extensive start-up investments which becomes a prohibitive factor for open research. Expanding on the idea of the Fab Lab as well as the RepRap movement, the Open Source Factory takes advantage of disciplinary expertise and trans-disciplinary knowledge in construction machine design accumulated over the past decade. With the goal to democratze access to large-scale industrial fabrication equipment, this paper outlines the creation of two full-scale fabrication systems: a RepRap based large-scale 3-axis open source CNC gantry and a 6-axis industrial robot system based on a decommissioned KUKA KR200/2. Both machines offer radically different economic frameworks for implementng research in advanced full scale robotc fabrication into contexts of pedagogy, the research lab, practce, or small scale local building industry. This research demonstrates that such equipment can be implemented by building on the current knowledge base in the field. If industrial robots and other large-scale fabrication tools become accessible for all, the collective sharing of research and the development of new ideas in full-scale robotc building construction can be substantially accelerated. © 2017 CURRAN-CONFERENCE.

AB  - The Arizona Autonomous Club is a student organization at the University of Arizona which designs, builds, and competes with Unmanned Air Systems (UAS). This year, a 25% scale Xtreme Decathlon model aircraft was selected and successfully converted into a fully autonomous UAS for the AUVSI Student Unmanned Aerial Systems (SUAS) 2017 competition. The UAS utilizes a Pixhawk autopilot unit, which is an independent, open-hardware project aiming at providing high-end autopilot hardware at low costs and high availability. The Pixhawk runs an efficient real time operating system (RTOS) and includes sensors such as a GPS unit, IMUs, airspeed, etc. The UAS also includes an onboard imaging system, which is controlled by an onboard computer (OBC). The Pixhawk and OBC are interconnected with two ground control stations (GCS) using the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework, which is capable of extending overall system capabilities to include an expanded telemetry downlink, obstacle avoidance, and manual overrides.

AB  - An odorant system manufactured by LEWA GmbH was installed in 2004 at Suape Terminal facilities in Pernambuco, Brazil and in 2006, it was integrated into the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), using a proprietary module that translated LEWA's protocol to to MODBUS RTU protocol. This modulo periodically stopped operation, requiring physical reset. In 2008 after an reset it stopped permanently. There weren't an spare module or a new one to buy - it was not commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) item. This work presents the developing of solution using a COTS industrial box PC, with open sources software components to provide serial communication, MODBUS TCP/IP server, system logger, besides the use of a Linux operational system and a free integrated development environment (IDE) for coding over the Java Open JDK - the Java open source development kit. We discuss the software architecture that permits synchronization between commands and data read beside error signaling; the implementation of an Arduino - open source hardware - simulator for the odorant system, that responds to commands and reads like a LEWA's unit; long time tests; and MODBUS TCP/IP server table. This solution for Suape Terminal were also adopted in 2013 for Santos Terminal in São Paulo, Brazil, where there are two others odorant units. The subject matter is extended to describe the solution for an issue observed in 2015, after some years in production - the pump running signaling, that was obtained by the read of odorant flow totalizer, for low flow rate, flaws with successive on and off indications. This problem conducted us to create an virtual flow rate indicator - the odorant's controller doesn't provides this signal -, using a Kalman Filter as estimator. We describe the problem symptoms, model construction and the computer solution through public-domain Java's math library - JAMA -, a kind of open source software package, created at National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for numeric linear algebra, to construct and manipulate matrices.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a solution for the levelling plate of fused deposition modelling (FDM) additive manufacturing (AM) systems. This automatic levelling system is presented as an evolution of actual systems, which uses a new ultrasound sensing system. Design/methodology/approach - After obtaining a prototype, different tests were conducted for getting a system which solves the level plate problem and can be mounted in any FDM AM machine. Several benchmark models were obtained and compared with current equipment concepts for the validity of the product. Findings - All tests were performed with high accuracy, enabling the production of geometries that could not have been achieved without this novel system. Practical implications - This development will enable experienced users to set aside the problems of calibration and focus on the purpose of this type of machines, making prototypes. Originality/value - A system architecture has been developed and integrated into an open hardware AM system, allowing real-time adjustment of the plate during each layer, thus eliminating the need of levelling the plate, allowing to achieve easier printing, and without increasing the cost significantly. © Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The monitoring of precipitation amounts plays an important role in the estimation of water balance as well as in the understanding of complex hydrological processes taking part in a catchment. High spatial and temporal variability of the rainfall could have a significant impact on the reliability of the performed hydrological analyses, which puts an increasing demand on sampling frequency and density of monitoring network. This is especially important in the case of small catchments, often with a small number or no monitoring stations at all, and local analyses where higher sampling frequency is a must. The relatively high cost of the commercial rain gauges, communication systems and post-processing software is the main reason why the collection of the precipitation amounts and the density of the monitoring network is still a challenge especially in developing countries. Latest advances in the low-cost open-source hardware and software sensor and electronics platforms together with the reduced costs and improved precision of 3D printers enable to design, develop and deploy custom low-cost measurement equipment. In this study a low-cost two-chamber tipping-bucket type rain gauge was designed and constructed. The electronics and the software of the gauge utilized an open-source Arduino platform, with the body of the gauge printed on a 3D printer using a fused filament fabrication technology, and an ABS thermoplastic polymer. The study describes the construction of the gauge and the function of the control software. However, the main goal of the study was to evaluate the precision and accuracy of the gauge in laboratory conditions and to calibrate a volume of water needed to tip the bucket from one position into another. In order to reduce the uncertainty the proposed laboratory experiment was conducted several times with various artificial rainfall intensities. The results showed a small variance in the values of the estimated volumes needed to tip the bucket as well as a clear positive relationship between these values and the rainfall intensities. © SGEM2017 All Rights Reserved.

AB  - The Center for Space Research has been operating four neutron monitor (NM) stations since the 1960s and has also developed mini neutron monitors, initially to calibrate the stations. To upgrade the aging electronics in the NMs, a new electronic system has been developed. The aim of the new electronic design is to be modular so that it can be easily adapted to stationary or mobile NMs. The system uses commercial-off-the-shelf components and publicly-available software where possible. The software and hardware designs will be made freely available to the international NM community. The system is also designed for easy maintenance and calibration. It is affordable, shielded against electromagnetic interference and it makes the data available on the internet in real-time. The electronic system also features a fast acquisition system for pulse shape recording and microsecond accurate event timestamps. The pulse profiles are used for calibration and integrity testing to ensure long term stability. The accurate timestamps make multiplicity and time-of-arrival studies possible. Some first measurements with the new electronic system are presented and compared to previous systems. © Copyright owned by the author(s) under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).

AB  - Purpose: Smart eyewear, such as augmented or virtual reality headset, allows the projection of virtual content through a display worn on the user’s head. This paper aims to present a mobile platform, named “CARTON”, which transforms a smartphone into smart eyewear, following a do-it-yourself (DIY) approach. This platform is composed of three main components: a blueprint to build the hardware prototype with very simple materials and regular tools; a software development kit (SDK) to help with the development of new applications (e.g. augmented reality app); and, finally, a second SDK (ControlWear) to interact with mobile applications through a Smartwatch. Design/methodology/approach: User experiments were conducted, in which participants were asked to create, by themselves, the CARTON’s hardware part and perform usability tests with their own creation. A second round of experimentation was conducted to evaluate three different interaction modalities. Findings: Qualitative user feedback and quantitative results prove that CARTON is functional and feasible to anyone, without specific skills. The results also showed that ControlWear had the most positive results, compared with the other interaction modalities, and that user interaction preference would vary depending on the task. Originality/value: The authors describe a novel way to create a smart eyewear available for a wide audience around the world. By providing everything open-source and open-hardware, they intend to solve the reachability of technologies related to smart eyewear and aim to accelerate research around it. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Biologically inspired vision systems, such as convolutional networks, have begun to rival humans in some vision tasks. A key difference between such systems and the human visual system is that the latter dedicates most of its resources to a small fraction of the visual field (the fovea), which it moves frequently and rapidly to acquire a series of rich representations of small parts of a scene. We are developing an artificial system to approximate this aspect of human vision on a robot. The main components are a novel foveating lens, and a novel gimbal that can perform rapid and precise stereo camera orientation. This paper focuses on the gimbal design, which we are releasing under an open hardware license. We expect that it will serve as both an advanced robot vision system, and a source of further insight into human vision. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Open Hardware and Free Software have both active communities. Open source software projects have helped many companies launch their products, but that has not happened in the same proportion for hardware. Assistive technology industry is known to be extremely restricted to proprietary solutions, which may lead to slower development cycles as there is a smaller community of device developers. This paper details how an Arduino-based open hardware project can be improved to become an industrial product with the same quality level of existing available devices. The resulting product is scheduled to be released to the public this year and will expand the use of power wheelchairs in Brazil so that people with disabilities have access to such electronic equipment. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Power Park comprised of multiple modular microgrids exhibits advantages including: better control flexibility, higher scalability, higher reliability, etc. The energy management system (EMS) of the Power Park can be divided into three layers, namely, converter layer, microgrid module layer and Power Park layer. In order to realize system control objectives in different layers, Beaglebone Black (BBB) is implemented for both microgrid module controller and Power Park Controller. BBB is a low-power open-source hardware single-board computer. Different control algorithms are implemented in each layer to realize respective control objectives. In converter layer control, converter controllers are scheduled to operate based on local information to realize systematic coordination in distributed control. In microgrid module layer, BBB coordinates various converters based on the Field-Area Network (FAN) communication. Functions like secondary voltage/frequency regulation, contingency analysis, etc. are executed to enhance control accuracy within the module. In Power Park layer, Park-Area Network (PAN) is implemented for communication between the central controller and multiple module controllers. Unit Commitment (UC), Economic Dispatch (ED) and Optimal Power Flow (OPF) are executed to schedule the coordination among modules as well as power exchange with utility grid to realize economic optimization. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - This paper is focused in the inclusion of open software tools and standard hardware devices into advanced mobility AIDS. Its urgency is due to the incorporation need of the numerous advances in mobile robotics to the area of the Assistive Technologies, and more specifically in the field of the so called Intelligent Wheelchairs (IW). In this paper we propose a common core for IWs based both on an open robotic platform and an open and a well extended software for robotics (ROS 'Robotic Operating System'). Such an IW core has got a distributed architecture whose processing nodes are linked through a CAN standard bus, which connects the low level control functions based on low cost and highly portable Cortex platforms. This paper describes also the autonomous navigation algorithm developed for the Intelligent Wheelchair by using an Extended Kalman Filter. In the chosen approach the absolute position of the IW (a mobile robot) is estimated using sensor fusion which combines data from two of the sensory systems included in the described open platform: the dead-reckoning system and a visual system based on QR landmarks located on the ceiling. Within this context, the paper demonstrates the potential of the platform proposal in relation to the quick and easy incorporation of recent advances in mobile robotics. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - This paper explains the design and implementation of a low cost Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) system. The system is designed using open source hardware and off-the-shelf components for a cost of below 8 USD. The device identification system makes use of the current-peak signature to uniquely identify devices turned ON at any instance in time. A current sensor is used at the utility service entrance for measuring the current drawn by the devices. The positive current peak data for different devices was used to obtain the devices' current-peak signature. The identification of devices is carried out by the device identification algorithm. An experimental test bench was developed to model, test and validate the system. The system underwent extensive testing for four hundred and twenty man hours over duration of twelve weeks. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - This work presents Dimitri, an open-software & open-hardware robot torso equipped with modular low cost compliant joints, built to allow advanced research on human-robot interaction, force-aware object manipulation and environment exploration. The robot has 13 DOFs: 4 DOFs with series elastic actuators in each arm, 3 DOFs for roll, pitch and yaw of the waist, and 2 DOFs for head pan and tilt. Our main innovation is in the employment of a polyurethane based compliant spring system attached to conventional robotics servo motors, turning them into low-cost series elastic actuators (SEAs). To demonstrate the robot's capabilities in the context of cognitive robotics research and goal-directed behavior, we successfully employed a multiple timescale recurrent neural network (MTRNN), enabling the robot to reproduce combined prototypical movement patterns previously trained via interactive demonstration. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - This paper reviews a new real-time measurement instrument dedicated for online neutron monitoring with fission chambers in nuclear reactors. The instrument implements the higher order Campbelling methods and self-monitoring capabilities on an open source development board. The board includes an CPU/FPGA System on a Chip. The feasibility of the measurement instrument was tested both in laboratory with a signal generator and in the Minerve reactor. It is shown that the instrument provides reliable and robust count rate estimation over a wide reactor power range based on the third order statistics of the fission chamber signal. In addition, the system is able to identify whether the measured count rate change is due to the malfunction of the detector or due to the change in the neutron flux. The applied self-monitoring method is based on the spectral properties of the fission chamber signal. During the experimental verification, the considered malfunction was the change of the polarization voltage. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - As power grids transition from a centralized distribution model to a distributed model, maintaining grid stability requires real-time power quality (PQ) monitoring and visualization. As part of the Open Power Quality (OPQ) project, we designed and deployed a set of open source power quality monitors and an open source cloud-based aggregation and visualization system built with the utility customer in mind. Our aim is to leverage a flexible privacy model combined with inexpensive and easy to use PQ meters in order to deploy a high density power quality monitoring network across the Hawaiian islands. In this paper we describe OPHub, a privacy focused open source PQ visualization along with results of a small scale deployment of our prototype PQ meter across the island of Oahu. Our results demonstrate that OPQ can provide useful power quality data at an order of magnitude less cost than prior approaches. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Software bugs are a critical threat to the deployability and maintainability of low-power wireless sensors, resulting in excess power consumption, hardware misconfigurations, incorrect data, and shortened device lifetimes. Worse, these errors can prevent wireless reprogramming, resulting in longer delays and costly human interventions. This letter describes shoulder angel - an ultra-low-power, low-cost, open hardware and software platform that ensures users can always recover and reprogram wireless sensors, in spite of software errors. Shoulder angel uses a physically separate coprocessor to monitor a device's power consumption and other behaviors, while keeping the device in a reprogrammable state. Our results show that shoulder angel is able to recover from otherwise fatal software errors while incurring an energy overhead of only 7μW. © 2009-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Although theoretically the patent system is meant to bolster innovation, the current United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is cumbersome and involves a significant time investment to locate inactive patents less than 20 years old. This article reports on the development of an open source database to find these public domain ideas. First, a search strategy is explained. Then the operation and use of free and open source software are detailed to meet the needs of open hardware innovators. Finally, a case study is presented to demonstrate the utility of the approach with 3-D printing. The results showed how the Free Inactive Patent Search enables users to search using plain language text to find public domain concepts and then provides a hyperlinked list of ideas that takes users to the USPTO database for the patent for more information. All of the source code to operate the search and the website are open source themselves and provided in the public domain for free. In the case study on 3-D printing the time to identify public domain patents was cut by a factor of more than 1500. This tool has the potential for accelerating the development of open hardware technologies to create high value for the public. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - An in-house solution for the verification of dose delivered to a moving phantom as required for the clinical implementation of lung stereotactic ablative body radiation therapy was developed. The superior–inferior movement required to simulate tumour motion during a normal breathing cycle was achieved via the novel use of an Arduino Uno™, a low-cost open-source microcontroller board connected to a high torque servo motor. Slow CT imaging was used to acquire the image set and a 4D cone beam CT (4D-CBCT) verified the efficacy of contoured margins before treatment on the moving phantom. Treatment fields were delivered to a section of a CIRS™ anthropomorphic phantom. Dose verification to the dynamic phantom with Gafchromic EBT3 film using 3 %-1 mm gamma analysis acceptance criteria registered an absolute dose pass rate for IMRT and VMAT of 98 and 96.6 %, respectively. It was verified that 100 % of the PTV received the prescribed dose of 12 Gy per fraction using the dynamic phantom, and no major discrepancy between planned and measured results due to interplay between multileaf collimator sequences and target motion was observed. This study confirmed that the use of an in-house solution using open source hardware and software with existing quality assurance equipment was appropriate in validating a new treatment technique. © 2016, Australasian College of Physical Scientists and Engineers in Medicine.

AB  - Sustainability of irrigation practices is an important objective to be pursued in many countries, especially in regions where water scarcity causes strong conflicts among different water uses. The efficient use of irrigation water is a key factor in coping with the food demands of an increasing world population and with the negative effects of climate change on water resource availability in many areas. In this complex context, it is important that farmers can rely on instruments and practices that enable a better management of water at the field scale, whatever the irrigation method they adopt. In this paper, we present an open-hardware device based on the Arduino technology that was developed to allow the continuous monitoring of soil water potential in the root zone for supporting irrigation scheduling at the field scale. The structure of the device is flexible and can be adapted to host different types of sensors. The results, obtained managing irrigation in a peach orchard, show that adoption of the device, together with a simple irrigation scheduling criterion, allowed a significant increase of water use efficiency without causing a reduction of the quantity and quality of crop production.

AB  - A reliable and cheap equipment is hereby proposed for the deposition of thin films on several substrates. This system is capable of deposition using three different techniques sequentially on the same substrate. The techniques available are ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR), electrodeposition, and dip coating on both rigid and flexible conductive substrates (FTO, ITO-PEN). Using low-cost electronic components, we built a working prototype, driven by a simple software that is open source and user-friendly. In order to test our system, we used it to fabricate dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and counter electrodes of platinum and cobalt sulfide using both rigid glass-FTO and flexible ITO-PEN substrates. The electrodes as well as the complete devices have been characterized through cyclic voltammetry (CV). The solar cell devices have been characterized through current versus voltage curves (I-V) under simulated solar illumination. © Springer-Verlag London 2016.

AB  - This paper presents a tool to transform a smartphone into a smart eyewear, named "CARTON", following a Do-It-Yourself (DIY) approach. The hardware prototype is made with very simple materials and regular tools we could find anywhere. It also includes a Software Development Kit (SDK) with samples in order to easily adapt or develop new mobile app compatible with this kind of device. By providing everything open-source and open-hardware, we intend to solve the reachability of technologies related to smart eyewear and aim to accelerate research around it. Users experiments were conducted in which participants were asked to create, by themselves, the CARTON's hardware part and perform usability tests with their own creation. Qualitative user feedback and quantitative results prove that CARTON is functional and feasible by anyone, without specific skills.

AB  - The growing availability of robotic platforms and open-source software presents a striking opportunity for the advancement of scientific instrumentation. Multirotors are particularly versatile platforms which offer some clear advantages for marine-based research missions including mapping and surveying of coastal, glacial, or marine features, photogrammetry, remote atmospheric or water sample collection, specimen tracking, and rare-event monitoring. The Olin College Intelligent Vehicle Laboratory has been actively developing on multirotor platforms to autonomously perform these missions, with special focus on photogrammetric and breath condensate sample collection from cetaceans. A critical part of our work is the design of an intelligent controller which will allow the multirotor to land on the deck of a research vessel or vessel of opportunity following the completion of a mission. A central control computer that may be located on the vessel will call the multirotor to return to the research vessel's deck, which has continued to travel during the mission. A global positioning system (GPS) attached to a specialized platform on the deck of the boat provides the current position of the landing platform to the multirotor. Once the multirotor arrives above the perceived location of the landing platform, a downward facing camera mounted onto the vehicle is used to identify a fiducial element that is located on the platform. Using the fiducial element and known state of the vehicle, a visual surveying methodology is used to allow the vehicle to land accurately on the specialized landing platform. Unlike in most simulated or controlled environments, the deck of a vessel of opportunity can move unpredictably in 5 axes (roll, pitch, yaw, longitudinal, latitudinal) due to oceanic characteristics and weather conditions. At present, trained multirotor pilots are the standard for controlling air vehicles, especially under these conditions. The scalability, risk, and cost of using a highly skilled human pilot limits the usefulness of these platforms in large-scale research missions. We are aiming to minimize the cost and risk associated with these platforms by making them accessible to untrained pilots as well as allowing for use of multiple platforms at one time and allowing for easy design of missions that the vehicle can conduct semi-supervised. Beyond obvious physical changes to the multirotor, including reinforcing structures or waterproofing, the multirotor itself must behave adaptively and sensitively to its environment. Our multirotors are equipped with the open hardware/software PixHawk autopilot system, which automatically rejects small environmental disturbances and provides telemetry data, such as GPS position and state of the vehicle which we use for our controller. A camera mounted to a stabilizing gimbal at the nose of the multirotor captures HD images, and a wireless video link transmits these images and the data from the autopilot to the vessel-mounted computer for processing. Our landing platform is also equipped with a GPS and streams information to the central computer. Two types of error are calculated by the computer: macro-error and micro-error. Macro-error refers to the gross positions of the landing platform and the vehicle using GPS signals. Microerror refers to the position of the vehicle in reference to the position of the landing platform fiducial element. These are used to determine the appropriate thrust and directional vectors to give to the vehicle to make a successful landing. In Spring of 2016, we implemented successful fiducial identification using computer vision techniques which extract vehicle state and image information to determine relative location of the vehicle to a known fiducial. Using this, we have developed a preliminary controller which allows for station-keeping of the vehicle above an identified fiducial on the ground. In the Summer of 2016, we will continue to develop the control scheme for fiducial identification, vehicle navigation, and landing procedure through field tests at locations including Buzzards Bay, Lake Waban, and the Gloucester Harbor. Our technology depends upon, and is itself, open-source. This allows for rapid iteration of controller design and means that what we develop can be made widely available to the marineresearch community for immediate use or customization. By putting these powerful tools in the hands of marine researchers, the need for completing missions manually can be eliminated. Landing on a vessel of opportunity is a significant step towards fully autonomous aerial instrumentation for marine-based research. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Smart Meters (SM) are one of the first bricks in the case of Smart Grids. Indeed, the control of flows in real time contributes to the efficient management of energy and enables consumers to identify their energy-intensive appliances and, subsequently, to change their consumption practices. However, the large-scaled deployment of intelligent measurement systems will require huge investments, which will directly affect the final consumer. This paper presents the design, implementation and realization of an intelligent electricity meter. This counter is based on low cost, open hardware and software structures. It is intended to monitor, manage and control a photovoltaic water pumping station. The intelligence faculty is, indeed, due to the fact that this meter is communicating thanks to the use of new information and communication technologies (ICT). © 2005 - 2016 JATIT & LLS.

AB  - The electrocardiographic signal (ECG) reflects the electrical behavior of the human heart. The ECG signal is composed by different waveforms: P, Q, R, S and T. The R wave is normally the easiest waveform to identify on the ECG. The R wave is also the component with the highest amplitude and its detection allows the estimation of the heart rate. This paper is devoted to present the design of a digital filter implemented on an open hardware platform called Arduino to detect the R wave of the ECG signal. The filter design is based on the integration of a smooth filter and the first order derivative. The implemented digital filter has been tested using different ECG signals generated by a patient simulator. Finally, this paper shows a positive performance of the implemented filter in tests related to R wave detection even in the presence of unwanted noise components. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Modern industry requires an improved motor performance and the permanent magnet brushless DC (BLDC) motors are especially appropriate for applications that require a high level of accuracy and performance. The advanced control strategies when applied into BLDC motor drive systems may further enhance their performance. However, these methods are relatively complex and computationally intensive, which may hamper the implementation. Fuzzy logic control algorithm has been developed in this investigation and embedded into a commercially available motion control system for the position control of BLDC motors. BLDC motor drives offered by PicoMotion Inc. and Motion Control Framework software platform have been selected for the experiments due to their compactness, flexibility and the open hardware and software concept they have been created upon. The obtained comparative results with respect to the built in PI control law have confirmed that the implementation of more advanced control strategies on inexpensive hardware and software platforms, nowadays available on the market for the control of BLDC motors, can be practically feasible and can enhance their performance. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) vision relies on reliable low-power wireless technologies and a complete standardized protocol stack that brings Internet connectivity to constrained end devices. Currently IEEE802.15.4-2015 TSCH provides reliability over low-power wireless technologies and the IETF has defined a protocol stack that is suitable to constrained devices. Open-source initiatives contributing to the development of network stacks for embedded devices, and the availability of open hardware platforms that facilitate prototyping IIoT applications contributes to the adoption of IIoT technologies. To realize the IIoT vision, this demo presents the Open- WSN and OpenMote projects, which provide both an opensource software implementation of the IEEE low-power wireless technologies and the IETF protocol stack, and an open-source hardware platform that meets the requirements to prototype IIoT applications. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - In optogenetics, researchers use light and genetically encoded photoreceptors to control biological processes with unmatched precision. However, outside of neuroscience, the impact of optogenetics has been limited by a lack of user-friendly, flexible, accessible hardware. Here, we engineer the Light Plate Apparatus (LPA), a device that can deliver two independent 310 to 1550 nm light signals to each well of a 24-well plate with intensity control over three orders of magnitude and millisecond resolution. Signals are programmed using an intuitive web tool named Iris. All components can be purchased for under $400 and the device can be assembled and calibrated by a non-expert in one day. We use the LPA to precisely control gene expression from blue, green, and red light responsive optogenetic tools in bacteria, yeast, and mammalian cells and simplify the entrainment of cyanobacterial circadian rhythm. The LPA dramatically reduces the entry barrier to optogenetics and photobiology experiments. © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - This paper presents a case study analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of using project-based learning (PBL) combined with collaborative learning (CL) and industry best practices, integrated with information communication technologies, open-source software, and open-source hardware tools, in a specialized microcontroller and embedded systems engineering Master's course. In addition to addressing industry requirements in both contents and methodology, the course develops capabilities and competencies in problem solving, independent learning, teamwork, and technical knowledge. Since PBL methodology alone does not ensure teamwork, it was complemented with CL. Design review meetings (as described in IEC 61160), deliverables, and organizational resources were also introduced to mirror industry demands. This structure integrated course content and student academic achievement in a simulated industrial environment. The course had students build a modular management system for home appliances, implementing control software on the "Arduino" open-source platform, as well as using wireless communications. The results show that teaching, learning, and student assessment processes can be improved by using PBL with CL. In addition, the introduction of industry practices, such us peer review meetings, brings academia closer to a real-world context. © 1963-2012 IEEE.

AB  - In this work we use the Arduino UNO R3 open source hardware platform to assemble an experimental apparatus for the measurement of the time constant of an RC circuit. With adequate programming, the Arduino is used as a signal generator, a data acquisition system and a basic signal visualisation tool. Theoretical calculations are compared with direct observations from an analogue oscilloscope. Data processing and curve fitting is performed on a spreadsheet. The results obtained for the six RC test circuits are within the expected interval of values defined by the tolerance of the components. The hardware and software prove to be adequate to the proposed measurements and therefore adaptable to a laboratorial teaching and learning context. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Membrane-based water treatment processes often require sophisticated control and monitoring that is not possible through manual operation. Automated regulation of pressure or flux through a membrane is required to minimize membrane fouling, thus maximizing efficiency and lifespan. Myriad automation tools exist, ranging from single purpose-built solutions to numerous linked sensors and hardware controls, all analyzed and controlled though commercially-available proprietary hardware and software. This paper outlines a way to design control systems for membrane-based filtration that utilize open source hardware and software, increasing the flexibility of a system to changing performance requirements while simultaneously minimizing the expense in time and resources to implement the control scheme. The method presented here can reduce the capital requirement for system control by one to two orders of magnitude while enhancing flexibility for system expansion and process sharing. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Microbial water quality monitoring for the presence of faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) is a mandatory activity in many countries and is key in public health protection. Despite technological advances and a need for methodological improvements, chromogenic and fluorogenic enzymatic techniques remain the mainstays of water quality monitoring for both public health agencies and regulated utilities. We demonstrated that bioelectroanalytical approaches to FIB enumeration are possible and can be achieved using commercially available enzyme-specific resorufin glycosides, although these are expensive, not widely available or designed for purpose. Following this, we designed two naphthoquinone glycosides which performed better, achieving Escherichia coli detection in the range 5.0 × 102 to 5.0 × 105 CFU ml−1 22–54% quicker than commercially available resorufin glycosides. The molecular design of the naphthoquinone glycosides requires fewer synthetic steps allowing them to be produced for as little as US$50 per kg. Tests with environmental samples demonstrated the low tendency for abiotic interference and that, despite specificity being maintained between β-glucuronidase and β-galactosidase, accurate enumeration of E. coli in environmental samples necessitates development of a selective medium. In comparison to a commercially available detection method, which has U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approval, our approach performed better at high organism concentrations, detecting 500 organisms in 9 h compared with 13.5 h for the commercial method. Bioelectroanalytical detection is comparable to current approved methods and with further development could result in improved detection times. A recent trend for low-cost open-source hardware means that automated, potentiostatically controlled E. coli detection systems could be constructed for less than US$100 per channel. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Open-source technology not only has facilitated the expansion of the greater research community, but by lowering costs it has encouraged innovation and customizable design. The field of automated microscopy has continued to be a challenge in accessibility due the expense and inflexible, noninterchangeable stages. This paper presents a low-cost, open-source microscope 3-D stage. A RepRap 3-D printer was converted to an optical microscope equipped with a customized, 3-D printed holder for a USB microscope. Precision measurements were determined to have an average error of 10 μm at the maximum speed and 27 μm at the minimum recorded speed. Accuracy tests yielded an error of 0.15%. The machine is a true 3-D stage and thus able to operate with USB microscopes or conventional desktop microscopes. It is larger than all commercial alternatives, and is thus capable of high-depth images over unprecedented areas and complex geometries. The repeatability is below 2-D microscope stages, but testing shows that it is adequate for the majority of scientific applications. The open-source microscope stage costs less than 3–9% of the closest proprietary commercial stages. This extreme affordability vastly improves accessibility for 3-D microscopy throughout the world. © 2016 The Authors Journal of Microscopy © 2016 Royal Microscopical Society

AB  - To reduce the wastage of electric power and electrical fires that are caused by the negligence of the elderly, this paper proposes an Internet of Things (IoT)-assisted relay control system in social networking environments. The proposed system comprises a power strip; three relays for the power strip control; an open hardware platform with light, temperature, and humidity sensors; and a camera module. In particular, it can support IP-based wireless connectivity and social networking through the Telegram Bot communicate with the elderly and their authorized persons such as family, a nurse, or a social worker. The user will receive the information from the proposed system, such as on/off states of the power strip, a type of devices connected to the power strip, and current measurement values from them, through a Telegram application on a smartphone. After checking the on/off states, the type of devices, and current measurement values, the user can decide which relays need to be controlled and send text messages with the indices of the specific relays and corresponding commands to the proposed system. Furthermore, to receive any alert messages for power saving and accident prevention, we can change the reference values for the sensors. Some experimental results verify that the proposed system can control on/off operation of the three relays, provide alert message services, and check the status of the power strip. © 2016 International Information Institute.

AB  - There are currently no standardized objective measures to assess beer quality based on the most significant parameters related to the first impression from consumers, which are visual characteristics of foamability, beer color and bubble size. This study describes the development of an affordable and robust robotic beer pourer using low-cost sensors, Arduino® boards, Lego® building blocks and servo motors for prototyping. The RoboBEER is also coupled with video capture capabilities (iPhone 5S) and automated post hoc computer vision analysis algorithms to assess different parameters based on foamability, bubble size, alcohol content, temperature, carbon dioxide release and beer color. Results have shown that parameters obtained from different beers by only using the RoboBEER can be used for their classification according to quality and fermentation type. Results were compared to sensory analysis techniques using principal component analysis (PCA) and artificial neural networks (ANN) techniques. The PCA from RoboBEER data explained 73% of variability within the data. From sensory analysis, the PCA explained 67% of the variability and combining RoboBEER and Sensory data, the PCA explained only 59% of data variability. The ANN technique for pattern recognition allowed creating a classification model from the parameters obtained with RoboBEER, achieving 92.4% accuracy in the classification according to quality and fermentation type, which is consistent with the PCA results using data only from RoboBEER. The repeatability and objectivity of beer assessment offered by the RoboBEER could translate into the development of an important practical tool for food scientists, consumers and retail companies to determine differences within beers based on the specific parameters studied. © 2016

AB  - Large-scale high-throughput plant phenotyping (sometimes called phenomics) is becoming increasingly important in plant biology and agriculture and is essential to cutting-edge plant breeding and management approaches needed to meet the food and fuel needs for the next century. Currently, the application of these approaches is severely limited by the availability of appropriate instrumentation and by the ability to communicate experimental protocols, results and analyses. To address these issues, we have developed a low-cost, yet sophisticated open-source scientific instrument designed to enable communities of researchers, plant breeders, educators, farmers and citizen scientists to collect high-quality field data on a large scale. The MultispeQ provides measurements in the field or laboratory of both, environmental conditions (light intensity and quality, temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, time and location) and useful plant phenotypes, including photosynthetic parameters—photosystem II quantum yield (ΦII), non-photochemical exciton quenching (NPQ), photosystem II photoinhibition, light-driven proton translocation and thylakoid proton motive force, regulation of the chloroplast ATP synthase and potentially many others— and leaf chlorophyll and other pigments. Plant phenotype data are transmitted from the MultispeQ to mobile devices, laptops or desktop computers together with key metadata that gets saved to the PhotosynQ platform (https://photosynq.org) and provides a suite of web-based tools for sharing, visualization, filtering, dissemination and analyses. We present validation experiments, comparing MultispeQ results with established platforms, and show that it can be usefully deployed in both laboratory and field settings. We present evidence that MultispeQ can be used by communities of researchers to rapidly measure, store and analyse multiple environmental and plant properties, allowing for deeper understanding of the complex interactions between plants and their environment. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - This paper introduces swarm user interfaces, a new class of human-computer interfaces comprised of many autonomous robots that handle both display and interaction. We describe the design of Zooids, an open-source open-hardware platform for developing tabletop swarm interfaces. The platform consists of a collection of custom-designed wheeled micro robots each 2.6 cm in diameter, a radio base-station, a highspeed DLP structured light projector for optical tracking, and a software framework for application development and control. We illustrate the potential of tabletop swarm user interfaces through a set of application scenarios developed with Zooids, and discuss general design considerations unique to swarm user interfaces. © 2016 ACM.

AB  - The proliferation of ubiquitous computing has led to the development of various types of sensor devices for human-computer interaction (HCI). However, the availability of developer tools is lacking in comparison with the development of sensor devices. This shortcoming has been partially addressed by the introduction of open source hardware but it is difficult to develop applications using this alone. In this paper, a framework for sensor device application development has been illustrated by using a visual language and interconnections between the PC and target board.

AB  - Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer is used in a wide range of biomaterial applications including microfluidics, cell culture substrates, flexible electronics, and medical devices. However, it has proved challenging to 3D print PDMS in complex structures due to its low elastic modulus and need for support during the printing process. Here we demonstrate the 3D printing of hydrophobic PDMS prepolymer resins within a hydrophilic Carbopol gel support via freeform reversible embedding (FRE). In the FRE printing process, the Carbopol support acts as a Bingham plastic that yields and fluidizes when the syringe tip of the 3D printer moves through it, but acts as a solid for the PDMS extruded within it. This, in combination with the immiscibility of hydrophobic PDMS in the hydrophilic Carbopol, confines the PDMS prepolymer within the support for curing times up to 72 h while maintaining dimensional stability. After printing and curing, the Carbopol support gel releases the embedded PDMS prints by using phosphate buffered saline solution to reduce the Carbopol yield stress. As proof-of-concept, we used Sylgard 184 PDMS to 3D print linear and helical filaments via continuous extrusion and cylindrical and helical tubes via layer-by-layer fabrication. Importantly, we show that the 3D printed tubes were manifold and perfusable. The results demonstrate that hydrophobic polymers with low viscosity and long cure times can be 3D printed using a hydrophilic support, expanding the range of biomaterials that can be used in additive manufacturing. Further, by implementing the technology using low cost open-source hardware and software tools, the FRE printing technique can be rapidly implemented for research applications. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A number of physical factors can adversely affect cultural heritage. Therefore, monitoring parameters involved in the deterioration process, principally temperature and relative humidity, is useful for preventive conservation. In this study, a total of 15 microclimate stations using open source hardware were developed and stationed at the Mosque-Cathedral of Córdoba, which is registered with UNESCO for its outstanding universal value, to assess the behavior of interior temperature and relative humidity in relation to exterior weather conditions, public hours and interior design. Long-term monitoring of these parameters is of interest in terms of preservation and reducing the costs of future conservation strategies. Results from monitoring are presented to demonstrate the usefulness of this system. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Nearly every practical improvement in modeling human motion is well founded in a properly designed collection of data or datasets. These datasets must be made publicly available for the community could validate and accept them. It is reasonable to concede that a collective, guided enterprise could serve to devise solid and substantial datasets, as a result of a collaborative effort, in the same sense as the open software community does. In this way datasets could be complemented, extended and expanded in size with, for example, more individuals, samples and human actions. For this to be possible some commitments must be made by the collaborators, being one of them sharing the same data acquisition platform. In this paper, we offer an affordable open source hardware and software platform based on inertial wearable sensors in a way that several groups could cooperate in the construction of datasets through common software suitable for collaboration. Some experimental results about the throughput of the overall system are reported showing the feasibility of acquiring data from up to 6 sensors with a sampling frequency no less than 118 Hz. Also, a proof-of-concept dataset is provided comprising sampled data from 12 subjects suitable for gait analysis. © 2016

AB  - Mesoscale electromechanical systems find applications in fields such as medical instrumentation, soft robotics, microscopy, flexible electronics and imagining. This paper implements the printed circuit MEMS (PC-MEMS) process [1] for the fabrication of a ‘pop-up’ flexure-based mesoscale system that exploits the simplicity of 2-D manufacturing techniques such as sheet-metal operations and laser cutting to realize a 3-D mechanism. The fabrication of a laminated Delta robot with prismatic actuation is presented to exemplify this process. A working device with actuation and functional components such as linear guides, stepper motors and limit switches is designed and fully realized. Because the mechanism is popped out of the plane to achieve its 3D shape, we present a stiffness analysis to arrive at the out-of-plane (or ‘pop-out’) angles that the planar system must accommodate so that constraints/limits on actuator torque/force can be can satisfied while producing an operational system. The simplicity of the processes makes it a candidate for the use in the emerging open-source hardware technologies for fabricating low-cost, complex, electromechanical systems. © 2016 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers

AB  - Open source hardware (OSHW) has been created by the design movement and is a promising technology as it applies a compatible concept to a variety of components. Also, OSHW is intended to enable anyone to study specific hardware, makes modifications, and share hardware changes with peers. In this paper, we present the sensor interface application of OSHW. To develop embedded systems using the concept of OSHW, we developed and tested a monitoring module based on the Beaglebone Black for a chip inspection system. The developed module can be used in low power monitoring, and can obtain a more flexible sensor interface in the on-line chip fault inspection and isolation process. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - The use of lasers to weld polymer sheets provides a means of highly-adaptive and custom additive manufacturing for a wide array of industrial, medical, and end user/consumer applications. This paper provides an open source design for a laser polymer welding system, which can be fabricated with low-cost fused filament fabrication and off-the-shelf mechanical and electrical parts. The system is controlled with free and open source software and firmware. The operation of the machine is validated and the performance of the system is quantified for the mechanical properties (peak load) and weld width of linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) lap welds manufactured with the system as a function of linear energy density. The results provide incident laser power and machine parameters that enable both dual (two layers) and multilayer (three layers while welding only two sheets) polymer welded systems. The application of these parameter sets provides users of the open source laser polymer welder with the fundamental requirements to produce mechanically stable LLDPE multi-layer welded products, such as heat exchangers. © 2016 by the authors.

AB  - The commercial data acquisition systems used for seismic exploration are usually expensive equipment. In this work, a low cost data acquisition system (Geophonino) has been developed for recording seismic signals from a vertical geophone. The signal goes first through an instrumentation amplifier, INA155, which is suitable for low amplitude signals like the seismic noise, and an anti-aliasing filter based on the MAX7404 switched-capacitor filter. After that, the amplified and filtered signal is digitized and processed by Arduino Due and registered in an SD memory card. Geophonino is configured for continuous registering, where the sampling frequency, the amplitude gain and the registering time are user-defined. The complete prototype is an open source and open hardware system. It has been tested by comparing the registered signals with the ones obtained through different commercial data recording systems and different kind of geophones. The obtained results show good correlation between the tested measurements, presenting Geophonino as a low-cost alternative system for seismic data recording. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The miniaturization, sophistication, proliferation, and accessibility of technologies are enabling the capture of more and previously inaccessible phenomena in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, more information has not translated into a greater understanding of disease complexity to satisfy diagnostic and therapeutic needs. Challenges include noncompatible technology platforms, the need for wide-scale and long-term deployment of sensor technology (among vulnerable elderly patients in particular), and the gap between the “big data” acquired with sensitive measurement technologies and their limited clinical application. Major opportunities could be realized if new technologies are developed as part of open-source and/or open-hardware platforms that enable multichannel data capture sensitive to the broad range of motor and nonmotor problems that characterize PD and are adaptable into self-adjusting, individualized treatment delivery systems. The International Parkinson and Movement Disorders Society Task Force on Technology is entrusted to convene engineers, clinicians, researchers, and patients to promote the development of integrated measurement and closed-loop therapeutic systems with high patient adherence that also serve to (1) encourage the adoption of clinico-pathophysiologic phenotyping and early detection of critical disease milestones, (2) enhance the tailoring of symptomatic therapy, (3) improve subgroup targeting of patients for future testing of disease-modifying treatments, and (4) identify objective biomarkers to improve the longitudinal tracking of impairments in clinical care and research. This article summarizes the work carried out by the task force toward identifying challenges and opportunities in the development of technologies with potential for improving the clinical management and the quality of life of individuals with PD. © 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society. © 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society

AB  - Scattering experiments are fundamental for structure analysis of matter on molecular, atomic and sub-atomic length scales. In contrast, it is not standard to demonstrate optical scattering experiments on the undergraduate level beyond simple diffraction gratings. We present an inexpensive Mie scattering setup manufactured with 3D printing and open hardware. The experiment can be used to determine the particle size in dilute monodisperse colloidal suspensions with surprisingly high accuracy and is, thus, suitable to demonstrate relations between scattering measurements and microscopic properties of particles within undergraduate lab course projects. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The Open Prototype for Educational NanoSats (OPEN) was created with the goal of providing institutions worldwide with access to a set of low-cost designs that could be easily modified and augmented for mission-specific needs. The basic design set has been created for and used to construct the University of North Dakota's OpenOrbiter CubeSat, which is currently awaiting a NASA launch awarded through the Educational Launch of Nanosatellites program. This paper considers the value of the OPEN design in the context of re-use through the presentation and analysis of several other missions that have successfully made use of elements of the design. These include deployable solar panel development, a power beaming demonstration mission and developing a space 3D printer. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Wireless Sensor and Actuators Networks (WSANs) constitute one of the most challenging technologies with tremendous socio-economic impact for the next decade. Functionally and energy optimized hardware systems and development tools maybe is the most critical facet of this technology for the achievement of such prospects. Especially, in the area of agriculture, where the hostile operating environment comes to add to the general technological and technical issues, reliable and robust WSAN systems are mandatory. This paper focuses on the hardware design architectures of the WSANs for real-world agricultural applications. It presents the available alternatives in hardware design and identifies their difficulties and problems for real-life implementations. The paper introduces SensoTube, a new WSAN hardware architecture, which is proposed as a solution to the various existing design constraints of WSANs. The establishment of the proposed architecture is based, firstly on an abstraction approach in the functional requirements context, and secondly, on the standardization of the subsystems connectivity, in order to allow for an open, expandable, flexible, reconfigurable, energy optimized, reliable and robust hardware system. The SensoTube implementation reference model together with its encapsulation design and installation are analyzed and presented in details. Furthermore, as a proof of concept, certain use cases have been studied in order to demonstrate the benefits of migrating existing designs based on the available open-source hardware platforms to SensoTube architecture. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The open-source release of self-replicating rapid prototypers (RepRaps) has created a rich opportunity for low-cost distributed digital fabrication of complex 3-D objects such as scientific equipment. For example, 3-D printable reactionware devices offer the opportunity to combine open hardware microfluidic handling with lab-on-a-chip reactionware to radically reduce costs and increase the number and complexity of microfluidic applications. To further drive down the cost while improving the performance of lab-on-a-chip paper-based microfluidic prototyping, this study reports on the development of a RepRap upgrade capable of converting a Prusa Mendel RepRap into a wax 3-D printer for paper-based microfluidic applications. An open-source hardware approach is used to demonstrate a 3-D printable upgrade for the 3-D printer, which combines a heated syringe pump with the RepRap/Arduino 3-D control. The bill of materials, designs, basic assembly, and use instructions are provided, along with a completely free and open-source software tool chain. The open-source hardware device described here accelerates the potential of the nascent field of electrochemical detection combined with paper-based microfluidics by dropping the marginal cost of prototyping to nearly zero while accelerating the turnover between paper-based microfluidic designs. © 2016, © 2016 Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening.

AB  - 3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, is the computer-guided process of fabricating physical objects by depositing successive layers of material. It has transformed manufacturing across virtually every industry, bringing about incredible advances in research and medicine. The rapidly growing consumer market now includes convenient and affordable “desktop” 3D printers. These are being used in the laboratory to create custom 3D-printed equipment, and a growing community of designers are contributing open-source, cost-effective innovations that can be used by both professionals and enthusiasts. User stories from investigators at the National Institutes of Health and the biomedical research community demonstrate the power of 3D printing to save valuable time and funding. While adoption of 3D printing has been slow in the biosciences to date, the potential is vast. The market predicts that within several years, 3D printers could be commonplace within the home; with so many practical uses for 3D printing, we anticipate that the technology will also play an increasingly important role in the laboratory. © 2016, © 2016 Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening.

AB  - The maker movement has shown how off-the-shelf devices can be combined to perform operations that, until recently, required expensive specialized equipment. Applying this philosophy to microfluidic devices can play a fundamental role in disseminating these technologies outside specialist labs and into industrial use. Here we show how nanoliter droplets can be manipulated using a commercial DVD writer, interfaced with an Arduino electronic controller. We couple the optical setup with a droplet generation and manipulation device based on the "confinement gradients" approach. This device uses regions of different depths to generate and transport the droplets, which further simplifies the operation and reduces the need for precise flow control. The use of robust consumer electronics, combined with open source hardware, leads to a great reduction in the price of the device, as well as its footprint, without reducing its performance compared with the laboratory setup. © 2016 Frot et al.

AB  - As the company and its volume of stored products grow, errors in the products inventory checkpoint are quite common due to both human failures and the lack of additional resources. Costs also come from the need to control the inventory and the information of stored products, where companies often hire specialized professionals in products inventory and in gathering information to carry out this task. Once they are stored in a disorganized way. The system is a software for inventory control, focusing on Radio Frequency Identification Technology (RFID) integrated into the Open Source Hardware board Radiuino, which offers great advantage because of the implementation cost. All of this resumes in a technology that is increasingly gaining share for being used in many technological areas. Based upon the information gathered, we developed a software using this technology to control the products in stock. In doing so, we monitor the ins and outs of the products flow, as well as addressing them in stock. This process facilitates the control, the maintenance and the dispatch of the internal products of the company. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - This paper proposes the use of OSHW to successfully penetrate the Internet of Things (IoT) market by using a social platform with a new interdisciplinary perspective rather than through the use of existing technical approaches. Snowball sampling was used in this study to survey 300 people who work and have had experiences with online brand communities for open source hardware (OSHW) at Fab Lab Seoul. The findings of this study indicate that content, consumer support, user interface, and reward are among the five factors that trigger an online brand community to develop a social OSHW platform. However, this study also found that brand reputation was insignificant relative to activating a social media platform for open-source software. In addition, activating a social platform for OSHW can positively affect to the brand community's loyalty for OSHW, which means that social platform innovation for OSHW can help form the positive attitude necessary to develop and diffuse an OSHW culture in a rapidly changing ICT ecosystem. This can be an important strategy for OSHW business and can contribute to the growth of the IoT market in South Korea. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To distinguish the classes of unknown data, classification is an important technique. If implemented on hardware these techniques provide more accuracy, faster response in real time predictions than any software implementation. Existing hardware implementations are not at all cost effective, and require specific knowledge of hardware platform. In this paper a cost effective implementation of a statistical classifier has been proposed on Raspberry Pi, an open source hardware platform. This proposed implementation provides on board training of the classifier and real time class prediction. Moreover, it does not require knowledge about the hardware platform to classify the data. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - In order to support the remote training of Mission Critical Operators, a standard interface and interconnection architecture had to be developed. While many others have created schemes for remote operation of equipment, many tend to either be customized to a target hardware, lack the requisite security protocols, or not be scalable. We have created such an architecture, leveraging existing commercial or open source hardware and software, and creating customizations where necessary to integrate the parts into an entire system. The result is an experience that connects students with industrially relevant hardware and software in a manner that approximates an industrial operator involved in remotely troubleshooting or configuring a networked remote resource. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - After many struggles from disability rights and independent-living advocates, urban accessibility has gradually become a concern for many urban planners across post-industrial countries. In this paper, based on ethnographic fieldwork studies in Barcelona working with urban accessibility professionals and activists, we argue for the importance of the ‘documentation interfaces’ created in their struggles: that is, the relational processes to collaboratively build multi-media accounts in a diversity of formats seeking to enforce different translations of bodily needs into specific urban accessibility arrangements. In discussion with the asymmetries that the ongoing expertization of accessibility might be opening up, we would like to foreground these apparently irrelevant practices as an interesting site to reflect on how urban accessibility struggles might allow us to rethink the project of technical democracy and its applications to urban issues. Two cases are analyzed: (1) the creation of Streets for All, a platform to contest and to sensitize technicians and citizens alike of the problems of ‘shared streets’ for the blind and partially sighted led by the Catalan Association for the Blind; and (2) the organization of the Tinkerthon, a DIY and open-source hardware workshop boosted by En torno a la silla to facilitate the creation of a network of tinkerers seeking to self-manage accessibility infrastructures. These cases not only bring to the fore different takes on the democratization of the relations between technical professionals and disability rights advocates, but also offer different approaches to the politics of universals in the design of urban accessibility arrangements. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Thanks to decades of research in clock technologies and synchronization protocols, it is now possible to measure and synchronize time across distributed systems with unprecedented accuracy. However, applications have not benefited to the same extent due to limitations of the system services that help manage time, and hardware-OS and OS-application interfaces through which timing information flows to the application. Due to the importance of time awareness in a broad range of emerging applications, running on commodity platforms and operating systems, it is imperative to rethink how time is handled across the system stack. We advocate the adoption of a holistic notion of Quality of Time (QoT) that captures metrics such as resolution, accuracy, and stability. Building on this notion we propose an architecture in which the local perception of time is a controllable operating system primitive with observable uncertainty, and where time synchronization balances applications' timing demands with system resources such as energy and bandwidth. Our architecture features an expressive application programming interface that is centered around the abstraction of a timeline - a virtual temporal coordinate frame that is defined by an application to provide its components with a shared sense of time, with a desired accuracy and resolution. The timeline abstraction enables developers to easily write applications whose activities are choreographed across time and space. Leveraging open source hardware and software components, we have implemented an initial Linux realization of the proposed timeline-driven QoT stack on a standard embedded computing platform. Results from its evaluation are also presented. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - In the world of water resource management, commercially available hydroclimatic monitoring systems are large, expensive, and disconnected. The current technology is inaccessible to smaller community groups, citizen scientists, teachers, and even university researchers needing to collect real time or high density data. The HydroSense project aims to build an open-source hardware and software framework to enable hydroclimatic monitoring in a more cost effective manner. At present, several prototype system components have been designed, fabricated, and tested. Our design demonstrates that a complete hydroclimatic monitoring system can be deployed at 1/8th the cost of modern commercially available systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability to interface with existing water quality sensors, allowing stakeholders the ability to use instruments they may already own. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - The OpenOrbiter CubeSat Development Initiative is working to build a small spacecraft system using open source software and open hardware principles. The important design considerations for the CubeSat include availability and performance. The essential contribution of this paper is the requirement elicitation and specification of system-wide qualities such as availability, performance, and security using quality attribute scenarios. The effect of using the quality-based scenarios is that it allows more rigorous treatment of non-functional requirements and hence proper selection of an architecture modeling to satisfy these requirements. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - The Internet of Things promises an always-connected future where the objects surrounding us will communicate in order to make our lives easier, more secure, etc. This evolution is a research opportunity as new solutions must be found to problems ranging from network interconnection to data mining. In the networking community, innovative solutions are being developed for the Device Layer of the Internet of Things, which includes the IoT wireless protocols. In order to study their performance, researchers turn more often to real world platforms, commonly designated by the term testbeds, on which they may implement and test the protocols and algorithms. This is even more important in the Industrial IoT field, where environments are perturbed by industrial systems like automated production systems. In this paper, after a brief presentation of the context of testbeds, we introduce WiNo and OpenWiNo, an open hardware and software framework for fast-prototyping in the field of the Internet of Things. Compared to existing platforms, the solution WiNo+OpenWiNo offers a wide array of Physical layers and easy integration of various sensors as it is developed as part of the Arduino ecosystem. It also allows research teams to easily and quickly deploy their own testbed into real environments. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - With the advent of open source hardware and software, students are able to perform advanced microelectronic experiments outside of the laboratory setting using low-cost components and equipment. Offering experiments outside of a traditional lab accommodates distance-learning as well as large class sizes. Many authors have addressed comparisons of in-lab laboratories with ones completed virtually or remotely,1,2 however much less has been studied regarding the use of actual, physical laboratories by students at home or in their dormitory rooms outside of the traditional laboratory.3,4 To respond to and leverage technological advancements in portable test and measurement equipment, several student-accessible electronics hardware platforms were considered including the NI myDAQ, Arduino development board, TI LaunchPad, BitScope, Analog Discovery, and a Creative Soundblaster USB Audio System. Ultimately, an initial pilot study with 14 students was conducted in a summer microelectronics course using the NI myDAQ. This, along with high-quality instructional videos, allowed students to complete experiments on their own outside of the laboratory setting. In this study, two of the later course hardware exercises - multi-stage amplifier and op-amp amplifier - were offered to half of the class as labs to be completed outside of the traditional laboratory. Independent validation of the experiment using randomized, multi-stage testing was performed and its effectiveness queried using in-person laboratory observations, instructor discussions, a post-laboratory survey, and student laboratory report assessment. Recommendations for implementing out-of-lab student experiments include anticipating hardware failure, encouraging student collaboration, and providing live TA assistance. As a result of the pilot work, additional laboratory offerings using these recommendations as well as explored alternative hardware solutions are being pursued. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2016.

AB  - This paper describes the development of a data acquisition and experiment control system for didactic laboratories, similar to the ones commonly used as part of introductory practical classes within science and engineering degree programs. The system is low-cost and easy to produce. The design of both the hardware and related software are available under a free license. In this way, we seek to offer an alternative to the proprietary products currently being used, thus reducing acquisition and maintenance costs and integrating users - students, teachers, and researchers - into the process of improving the system. We outline the features of the first prototypes and the results of several performance tests carried out using the device. The results obtained indicate that this is a viable alternative with potential for growth, and which meets the educational objectives in question. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents prototype implementation of low-cost, open hardware, static-gesture recognition system. The implemented system has three major components: A Glove and Sensor Unit (GSU)-consisting of a pair of gloves embedded with custom made, low-cost flex and contact sensors, a Primary Supporting Hardware (PSH) that maps change in input values from GSU, a Secondary Supporting Hardware (SSH) that processes the input values and recognizes the gesture accurately. When a gesture is signed, the GSU tracks the change in orientation of the fingers, which results in a change in voltage levels of the sensors. This change is mapped by the PSH and passed on to SSH which comprises of two ATmega328P microcontrollers, one connected to each of the glove. The two microcontrollers are connected in a master-slave configuration and communication between them is facilitated through an XBee module. The performance of this gesture recognition system is evaluated using a data set comprising of 36 unique gestures. These gestures represent a total of 120 gestures that include all gestures across five globally used sign languages. A gesture recognition engine that resides in the master microcontroller processes the input and identifies the gesture. The gesture recognition engine comprises of a two stage selection-elimination embedded intelligence algorithm that is used to enhance the system efficiency from 83.1% to 94.5% without any additional hardware. The cost of the system is USD 30, which the authors believe on commercialization, could be brought under USD 9. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - The precision and repeatability offered by computer-aided design and computer-numerically controlled techniques in biofabrication processes is quickly becoming an industry standard. However, many hurdles still exist before these techniques can be used in research laboratories for cellular and molecular biology applications. Extrusion-based bioprinting systems have been characterized by high development costs, injector clogging, difficulty achieving small cell number deposits, decreased cell viability, and altered cell function post-printing. To circumvent the high-price barrier to entry of conventional bioprinters, we designed and 3D printed components for the adaptation of an inexpensive 'off-the-shelf' commercially available 3D printer. We also demonstrate via goal based computer simulations that the needle geometries of conventional commercially standardized, 'luer-lock' syringe-needle systems cause many of the issues plaguing conventional bioprinters. To address these performance limitations we optimized flow within several microneedle geometries, which revealed a short tapered injector design with minimal cylindrical needle length was ideal to minimize cell strain and accretion. We then experimentally quantified these geometries using pulled glass microcapillary pipettes and our modified, low-cost 3D printer. This systems performance validated our models exhibiting: reduced clogging, single cell print resolution, and maintenance of cell viability without the use of a sacrificial vehicle. Using this system we show the successful printing of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into Geltrex and note their retention of a pluripotent state 7 d post printing. We also show embryoid body differentiation of hiPSC by injection into differentiation conducive environments, wherein we observed continuous growth, emergence of various evaginations, and post-printing gene expression indicative of the presence of all three germ layers. These data demonstrate an accessible open-source 3D bioprinter capable of serving the needs of any laboratory interested in 3D cellular interactions and tissue engineering. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Nowadays, many services and applications need to be secured. In this paper we present the design and the initial development of a new security-oriented open hardware and software platform easy to be integrated and capable of hiding significant complexity behind a set of simple high-level APIs. This SoC platform is called SEcube™ (Secure Environment cube). It is a single-chip design that embeds three main cores: a highly powerful processor, a Common Criteria certified smartcard, and a flexible FPGA. The SEcube™ platform provides several functional entry levels, ranging from the hardware to software APIs amenable to become service-ready in a near future. This way, developers who do not feel comfortable on security aspects can use the easy-to-use API abstraction layer and experience the Cube as a high-security black box. Conversely, security experts can avail of the open source character, and verify, change, or write from scratch the entire system, starting from the elementary low-level blocks. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Supporting learners affectively while carrying out stressful educational activities is an open research issue. It requires the appropriate infrastructure for recognizing emotional states and reacting accordingly in runtime. In this paper, we describe the open platform that we have implemented (named AICARP v2) to detect changes in physiological signals that can be associated with stressful situations, and when this happens, it recommends the learner to relax by delivering modulated sensorial support in terms of light, sound, or vibration at a relaxation breath rate. In this way, by taking advantage of ambient intelligence, the learner can perceive the recommended action without interrupting the learning activity (in this case, practicing the oral exam of a second language). The signal acquisition of the system (which combines sensors from Libellium e-Health platform with others integrated ad hoc) has been compared with a commercial system (JJ Engineering I-330-C2), obtaining similar outcomes as to identifying significant changes in the physiological signals when the learner experiments an emotional reaction. However, the cost of AICARP v2 is much lower, and at the same time, it is open hardware and flexible and, thus, has the advantage of providing runtime data processing. User studies have served to evaluate participants' perception of the sensorial support, as well as to calibrate the delivery rule and to evaluate the effectiveness of the support provided to them. © 2001-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Smart meters are an enabling technology for many smart grid applications. This paper introduces a design for a low-cost smart meter system as well as explaining fundamentals of smart metering. The smart meter platform, provided as open hardware, is designed with a connector interface compatible to the Arduino platform, thus opening the possibilities for smart meters with flexible hardware and computation features, starting from low-cost 8 bit micro controllers up to powerful single board computers that can run Linux. The metering platform features a current transformer which allows a non-intrusive installation of the current measurement unit. The suggested design can switch loads, offers a variable sampling frequency, and provides measurement data such as active power, reactive and apparent power. Results indicate that measurement accuracy and resolution of the proposed metering platform are sufficient for a range of different applications and loads from a few watts up to 5 kW. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - In this work, a new open hardware interface based on Arduino to read electromotive force (emf) from potentiometric detectors is presented. The interface has been fully designed with the open code philosophy and all documentation will be accessible on web. The paper describes a comprehensive project including the electronic design, the firmware loaded on Arduino, and the Java-coded graphical user interface to load data in a computer (PC or Mac) for processing. The prototype was tested by measuring the calibration curve of a detector. As detection element, an active poly(vinyl chloride)-based membrane was used, doped with cetyltrimethylammonium dodecylsulphate (CTA+-DS-). The experimental measures of emf indicate Nernstian behaviour with the CTA+ content of test solutions, as it was described in the literature, proving the validity of the developed prototype. A comparative analysis of performance was made by using the same chemical detector but changing the measurement instrumentation. © 2016 Author(s).

AB  - This article presents an alternative architechture implementation with the purpose of provide real experiments of remote access and expand teaching practices focused on experimentation toward physics education. The research uses a low cost open hardware and an available multiplatform with open source applications. With this initiative, lab resources can be accessed from schools, as many of them have not appropriate science lab for practical activities. This reserch have been applied in two public schools from Araranguá/SC that also face difficulties when using the computer lab. As a solution, the students use their own mobile devices to do science and physics experiments accessing, controlling and observing real experiments installed in the Remote Experimentation Lab (RExLab). Making new experiments is a collaborative work with the teachers of these schools and with the lab staff to adapt their idea to a low cost system with the Raspberry Pi. The study presented here intends to facilitate the experiments adaptation and motivate other research labs to make their experiments available. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - The availability of free and open source hardware designs that can be replicated with low-cost 3D printers provides large values to scientists who need highly-customized low-volume production scientific equipment. Digital manufacturing technologies have only recently become widespread and the return on investment (ROI) was not clear, so funding for open hardware development was historically sparse. This paper clarifies a method for determining an ROI for the development of scientific free and open source hardware (FOSH). By using an open source hardware design that can be manufactured digitally, the relatively minor development costs result in enormous ROIs for the scientific community. A case study is presented of a syringe pump released under open license, which results in ROIs for funders ranging from hundreds to thousands of percent after only a few months. It is clear that policies encouraging FOSH scientific hardware development should be adopted by organizations interested in maximizing return on public investments for science. © The Author 2015.

AB  - The need for automated analyzers for industrial and environmental samples has triggered the research for new and cost-effective strategies of automation and control of analytical systems. The widespread availability of open-source hardware together with novel analytical methods based on pulsed flows have opened the possibility of implementing standalone automated analytical systems at low cost. Among the areas that can benefit from this approach are the analysis of industrial products and effluents and environmental analysis. In this work, a multi-pumping flow system is proposed for the determination of phosphorus in effluents and polluted water samples. The system employs photometric detection based on the formation of molybdovanadophosphoric acid, and the fluidic circuit is built using three solenoid micropumps. The detection is implemented with a low cost LED-photodiode photometric detection system and the whole system is controlled by an open-source Arduino Uno microcontroller board. The optimization of the timing to ensure the color development and the pumping cycle is discussed for the proposed implementation. Experimental results to evaluate the system behavior are presented verifying a linear relationship between the relative absorbance and the phosphorus concentrations for levels as high as 50 mg L-1. © 2016, Sociedade Brasileira de Quimica.

AB  - OpenPET is an open source, modular, extendible, and high-performance platform suitable for multi-channel data acquisition and analysis. Due to the flexibility of the hardware, firmware, and software architectures, the platform is capable of interfacing with a wide variety of detector modules not only in medical imaging but also in homeland security applications. Analog signals from radiation detectors share similar characteristics-a pulse whose area is proportional to the deposited energy and whose leading edge is used to extract a timing signal. As a result, a generic design method of the platform is adopted for the hardware, firmware, and software architectures and implementations. The analog front-end is hosted on a module called a Detector Board, where each board can filter, combine, timestamp, and process multiple channels independently. The processed data is formatted and sent through a backplane bus to a module called Support Board, where 1 Support Board can host up to eight Detector Board modules. The data in the Support Board, coming from 8 Detector Board modules, can be aggregated or correlated (if needed) depending on the algorithm implemented or runtime mode selected. It is then sent out to a computer workstation for further processing. The number of channels (detector modules), to be processed, mandates the overall OpenPET System Configuration, which is designed to handle up to 1,024 channels using 16-channel Detector Boards in the Standard System Configuration and 16,384 channels using 32-channel Detector Boards in the Large System Configuration. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Open reduction internal fixation of proximal humerus fractures is often accomplished with proximal humerus locking plates. While these plates have a good track record, they can become symptomatic and require removal once the fracture has healed. Open hardware removal is associated with a number of additional risks to the patient, including infection, scarring, nerve damage, and blood loss. In addition, the recovery time after open hardware removal may be prolonged, thereby predisposing the patient to postoperative stiffness. The purpose of this article is to describe a technique for removing proximal humerus locking plates arthroscopically. Although technically demanding, the benefits of this technique include smaller incisions, quicker recovery time, decreased risk of infection, and reduced blood loss. Arthroscopy also provides the surgeon with the ability to address concomitant intra-articular pathology at the time of surgery. Additionally, we use a bone-void filler to reduce the risk of fracture through stress caused by previous screw holes. © 2016 Arthroscopy Association of North America.

AB  - Due to the low cost of easy-to-use components of open-source hardware and software, the Internet of Things may be pervading through everything everywhere. The dependability of the Internet of Things is critical because the services will be concerned with real life. However, the inexpensive hardware provides limited resources for communication. In this paper, we present exact all-terminal reliability of the wireless networks of which the number of links of each node is bounded. First, we analyze the all-terminal reliability of the regular wireless network, where any two nodes are connected by a wireless link consisting of a pair of radio modules. The reliability polynomial is derived from the Tutte polynomial that is the seminal work of the algebraic graph theory. Second, we analyze the all-terminal reliability of the wireless network including the random mesh network under the assumption that if the module fails, all radio links connected through a radio module are cut off. We consider both the fault of the communication module and the fading of the wireless channel in the indoor channel condition. For improving the reliability, we also propose a fault-tolerant method giving redundant radio modules into each node. We also analyze cost-effectiveness. We also calculate the mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) for wireless networks. We show that the random mesh network of which each node includes three or more the radio-broadcast modules is more dependable than any other regular network of which each node comprises four point-to-point modules if it is the connected graph in the static environment. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - The 21st century global competition has emphasized design of innovative products and solutions as the core competency requested today in the job market for engineers. To produce good design thinkers, design activities must be implemented in engineering curriculums, and have to start at early years. In this prospect, many leading universities have launched many interesting initiatives. These initiatives are, however, arduous for implementation in the context of universities in the developing countries due to deep-rooted local constraints, like shortage of financial and skilled human resources. Therefore, some tailored design learning initiatives, taking into account these constraints, have to be developed. In this context, a cost-effective project has been designed and implemented, in our faculty, to early introduce mechanical engineering students, in their first years, to engineering design. The proposed project was designed with respect to a proposed framework of desired engineering design competencies in conjunction with concerns for overcoming constraints and barriers of implementation context. The project encompasses two successive activities for the first and second years. The first activity plunges the students in a design thinking approach to create robotic applications using only cost-effective robotic kits. The second activity is dedicated to the design, analysis, and building of mechanical systems using only commonly used materials and cheap open hardware devices. Through this project, the students significantly improved some targeted skills as creative problem solving, communication, and teamwork. Finally, the project is thought to be valuable for all universities with similar context of limited resources. © SAGE Publications.

AB  - In this paper we use a locally developed adaptive watering system as an example of a remote controlled laboratory (RCL) developed with standard open hardware and using libraries taken from the e-lab. This experiment is a particular case that could benefit from a large number of RCLs proposing different water budget strategies, allowing the studies of the best controller algorithm to save water. The water consumption log can be monitored in real-time and served to any user as a distributed remote laboratory with support of a Raspberry PI and a web connection, using an open source Arduino board and custom made shield. The ultimate goal of RCLs will be achieved when anyone can easily publish their own experiment in the WWW. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Remote Controlled Laboratories (RLCs) are expanding everywhere and there is a need for an accessible, yet robust and affordable framework to convey private experiments to the Internet based on the "Internet of Things". In this article we shall introduce a framework based on ready available open hardware and software that can be used in schools, or even at home by anyone with elementary programming skills. In a simple way we discuss how to connect a microcontroller capable of handling an experimental apparatus to the Internet based on a Raspberry Pi, and how to connect the latter using the Go-Lab framework. Moreover remote maintenance for this distributed apparatus can be provided on-line namely for update the firmware when needed. An example of an experiment provided within this technology is given showing the possibilities of this approach. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - A critical parameter to assess the environmental status of water bodies is the transparency of the water, as it is strongly affected by different water quality related components (such as the presence of phytoplankton, organic matter and sediment concentrations). One parameter to assess the water transparency is the diffuse attenuation coefficient. However, the number of subsurface irradiance measurements obtained with conventional instrumentation is relatively low, due to instrument costs and the logistic requirements to provide regular and autonomous observations. In recent years, the citizen science concept has increased the number of environmental observations, both in time and space. The recent technological advances in embedded systems and sensors also enable volunteers (citizens) to create their own devices (known as Do-It-Yourself or DIY technologies). In this paper, a DIY instrument to measure irradiance at different depths and automatically calculate the diffuse attenuation Kd coefficient is presented. The instrument, named KdUINO, is based on an encapsulated low-cost photonic sensor and Arduino (an open-hardware platform for the data acquisition). The whole instrument has been successfully operated and the data validated comparing the KdUINO measurements with the commercial instruments. Workshops have been organized with high school students to validate its feasibility. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Recent developments in open source hardware and software platforms (Android, Arduino, Linux, OpenCV etc.) have enabled rapid development of previously expensive and sophisticated system within a lower budget and flatter learning curves for developers. Using these platform, we designed and developed a Java-based 3D robotic simulation system, with graph database, which is integrated in online and offline modes with an Android-Arduino based rubbish picking remote control car. The combination of the open source hardware and software system created a flexible and expandable platform for further developments in the future, both in the software and hardware areas, in particular in combination with graph database for artificial intelligence, as well as more sophisticated hardware, such as legged or humanoid robots. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Environmental data are critical to understanding environmental phenomena, yet their consistent collection and curation can be cost-prohibitive. This paper describes a recipe for the design, development, and deployment of a low-cost environmental data logging and transmission system for environmental sensors and its connection to an open source data-sharing network. The hardware is built using several low-cost, open-source, mass-produced components. The system automatically ingests data into HydroServer, a standards-based server in the open source hydrologic information system (HIS) created by the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Sciences Inc. (CUAHSI). By publishing data in this way, they are discoverable through the geographic information system (GIS)-based CUAHSI tools, HydroDesktop and HydroShare. In addition, because they follow WaterML encoding, open hardware data stored in the HIS can be included in international catalog such as the global earth observation system of system catalog. A recipe for building the system is provided. Multiple deployments used to test proof-of-concept of the system are described and their results are given. Ease of deployment and reliability of the logging and transmission system is also addressed. © IWA Publishing 2016.

AB  - The smart e-bike monitoring system (SEMS) is a platform for the real-time acquisition of usage data from electrically-assisted bikes (also called pedelecs or e-bikes). It is autonomous (runs off the bike battery), replicable (open source and open hardware), scalable (different fleet sizes) and modular (sensors can be added), so it can be used for further research and development. The system monitors location (global positioning system), rider control data (level of assistance) and other custom sensor input in real time. The SEMS data feeds an online interface for data analysis, for riders to view their own data and for sharing on social media. The basic system can be replicated by other researchers and can be extended with modules to explore various issues in e-bike research. The source code and hardware design are publicly available, under the General Public License, for non-commercial use. SEMS was implemented on 30 bikes and collected data during 10 months of real-word trials in the UK. This study details the design and implementation of the hardware and software, discusses the system use and explores features for future design iterations. The SEMS turns singular e-bikes into a networked fleet and is an example of the internet of things in the cycling context. © 2016 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

AB  - In this article, I explore the responses of the Open Source community to the Fukushima disaster by describing the development of collaborative technologies to measure radioactive contamination across Japan. Based on participant observation at Tokyo Hacker Space, this article addresses an emergent form of technoscientific expertise which is not confined to or legitimized by established institutions, but, rather, is distributed and organized around transnational networks of field specialists, companies, educational institutions, and volunteers. Both Tokyo Hacker Space, as an independent laboratory, and Safecast, as a spin-off project, advanced practices of hardware engineering and Open data management, which are examined in this article as manifestations of bricolage. As a concluding argument, I suggest that expertise and responsibility are interpretive keys for understanding the possibilities and impossibilities of collaboration and coordination in the context of Open Source-based responses to the Fukushima crisis. Responsibility has become an open question for Safecast and Tokyo Hacker Space, as both have championed "openness" as an ethical point of departure, a projected outcome, and a technical orientation in the context of the Fukushima disaster. © 2016 by the Institute for Ethnographic Research (IFER) a part of The George Washington University.

AB  - The deformation monitoring of structures and buildings is an important task field of modern engineering surveying, ensuring the standing and reliability of supervised objects over a long period. Several commercial hardware and software solutions for the realization of such monitoring measurements are available on the market. In addition to them, a research team at the University of Applied Sciences in Neubrandenburg (NUAS) is actively developing a software package for monitoring purposes in geodesy and geotechnics, which is distributed under an open source licence and free of charge. The task of managing an open source project is well-known in computer science, but it is fairly new in a geodetic context. This paper contributes to that issue by detailing applications, frameworks, and interfaces for the design and implementation of open hardware and software solutions for sensor control, sensor networks, and data management in automatic deformation monitoring. It will be discussed how the development effort of networked applications can be reduced by using free programming tools, cloud computing technologies, and rapid prototyping methods. © 2016 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Munich/Boston.

AB  - IrukaTact is an open source assistive underwater glove that translates ultrasonic range finding data into haptic feedback. This paper describes the development of new models for underwater haptic actuation and the ongoing prototype development process necessary for creating this tool. Our objective is to create a system that detects underwater topographies to assist the location of sunken objects in flooded areas by sending haptic signals to wearer's fingertips produced by micropumps that propel water of varying pressures. This feedback system extends current haptic technologies by providing hybrid actuation including pressure and vibration underwater, while preserving the wearer's natural ability to grasp objects. This technology has many potential applications beyond underwater echohaptic location, such as new interfaces for virtual reality object simulation in aqueous environments. © 2016 ACM.

AB  - Nowadays embedded systems have reached a great level of maturity and diffusion thanks to their small size, low power consumption, large connectivity and variety of application in everyday contexts. These systems, if properly structured and configured, can significantly increase the smartness of the environments where they are deployed, monitoring and continuously collecting data to be processed and elaborated. Such operations can be correctly executed, especially in large locations, if several embedded systems nodes are deployed under the design of an intelligent network. This paper presents SMuNe, a Smart Multisensor Network based on the BeableBone Black platform, a complete open hardware and software embedded computer, the challenge is to create a multi-purpose hierarchical network composed by smart nodes able to gain and manage heterogeneous data and spaces according to the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. As a proof of the effectiveness of SMuNe we conducted an experimentation within the Cultural Heritage domain, in detail we deployed SMuNe within a sculptures exhibition named "The Beauty or the Truth" in the monumental site of San Domenico Maggiore in Naples, Italy. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - This paper reports on the design of an open source-based control platform for the underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV) Visor3. The vehicle’s original closed source-based control platform is first described. Due to the limitations of the previous infrastructure, modularity and flexibility are identified as the main guidelines for the proposed design. This new design includes hardware, firmware, software, and control architectures. Open-source hardware and software platforms are used for the development of the new system’s architecture, with support from the literature and the extensive experience acquired with the development of robotic exploration systems. This modular approach results in several frameworks that facilitate the functional expansion of the whole solution, the simplification of fault diagnosis and repair processes, and the reduction of development time, to mention a few. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

AB  - Open source hardware has the potential to revolutionise the way we build scientific instruments; with the advent of readily available 3D printers, mechanical designs can now be shared, improved, and replicated faster and more easily than ever before. However, printed parts are typically plastic and often perform poorly compared to traditionally machined mechanisms. We have overcome many of the limitations of 3D printed mechanisms by exploiting the compliance of the plastic to produce a monolithic 3D printed flexure translation stage, capable of sub-micron-scale motion over a range of 8 × 8 × 4 mm. This requires minimal post-print clean-up and can be automated with readily available stepper motors. The resulting plastic composite structure is very stiff and exhibits remarkably low drift, moving less than 20 μm over the course of a week, without temperature stabilisation. This enables us to construct a miniature microscope with excellent mechanical stability, perfect for time-lapse measurements in situ in an incubator or fume hood. The ease of manufacture lends itself to use in containment facilities where disposability is advantageous and to experiments requiring many microscopes in parallel. High performance mechanisms based on printed flexures need not be limited to microscopy, and we anticipate their use in other devices both within the laboratory and beyond. © 2016 Author(s).

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to design intelligent robots operating in such dynamic environments like the RoboCup Middle-Size League (MSL). In the RoboCup MSL, two teams of five autonomous robots play on an 18-X 12-m field. Equipped with sensors and on-board computers, each robot should be able to perceive the environment, make decision and control itself to play the soccer game autonomously. Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents the design of our soccer robots, participating in RoboCup MSL. The mechanical platform, electrical architecture and software framework are discussed separately. The mechanical platform is designed modularly, so easy maintainability is achieved; the electronic architecture is built on industrial standards using PC-based control technique, which results in high robustness and reliability during the intensive and fierce MSL games; the software is developed upon the open-source Robot Operating System (ROS); thus, the advantages of ROS such as modularity, portability and expansibility are inherited. Findings: Based on this paper and the open-source hardware and software, the MSL robots can be re-developed easily to participate in the RoboCup MSL. The robots can also be used in other research and education fields, especially for multi-robot systems and distributed artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the main designing ideas proposed in the paper, i.e. using a modular mechanical structure, an industrial electronic system and ROS-based software, provide a common solution for designing general intelligent robots. Originality/value: The methodology of the intelligent robot design for highly competitive and dynamic RoboCup MSL environments is proposed. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - We describe an autonomous, fully functional implementation of the BB84 quantum key distribution protocol using open source hardware microcontrollers for the synchronization, communication, key sifting and real-time key generation diagnostics. The quantum bits are prepared in the polarization of weak optical pulses generated with light emitting diodes, and detected using a sole single-photon counter and a temporally multiplexed scheme. The system generates a shared cryptographic key at a rate of 365 bps, with a raw quantum bit error rate of 2.7%. A detailed description of the peripheral electronics for control, driving and communication between stages is released as supplementary material. The device can be built using simple and reliable hardware and it is presented as an alternative for a practical realization of sophisticated, yet accessible quantum key distribution systems. © 2016, Instituto de Fisica de Liquidos y Sistemas Biologicos.

AB  - Arduino is a popular open source hardware toolkit for science and engineering education due to its easy use and various good examples. But, students or beginners who have no experience and knowledge of electronic engineering or programming languages still feel a considerable barrier to use Arduino. This study analyzes the barrier of beginners in using the open source hardware. In order to resolve the difficulty in firmware programming, we adopt a functional concise script composed of simplified service commands and minimum options to use the open hardware and proposes a new script-based open source hardware programming environment. From the comparison result with previous development toolkit, we confirm that the programming by the proposed script-based simple programming toolkit is substantially simple by adopting simple script and automatic generations of irrelevant instructions, type declarations and semicolons in programming the open source hardware of Arduino. © 2016 SERSC.

AB  - Open Source Hardware (OSHW) follows the lead of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and has similar goals: ensuring developers can share their work without artificial hurdles, improving quality through peer review, avoiding vendor lock-in and providing for a fair playground in which projects can thrive and accommodate contributions without compromising their long-term future. The paper introduces OSHW and then attempts to answer a number of questions: (i) what are the perceived benefits and issues of OSHW, in general and in the context of public research facilities? (ii) what is new with respect to FOSS? (iii) what makes OSHW projects succeed or fail? The paper uses real examples of OSHW projects and practice throughout – mostly CERN-related because they are as good as any other and well known by the author – and concludes with some thoughts about what the future holds in this domain.

AB  - One of the most cost effective ways to make system control (automation) is by using open source hardware and software, in order to be cost oriented besides the price the systems need to be implemented in reasonable time frame and also needs to be reliable and safe. In this paper we will treat and justify the cases of using the Open Source Hardware and Software, in comparison to industry standard Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC). Also we will discuss about the point of system complexity where the cost reduction will not justify the time spend to build the interfacing of sensors, digital and analog I/O for the open source Hardware. © 2016

AB  - Robot development could benefit from reuse of hardware and software components. One of the most successful example is the Robot Operating System (ROS), which aims at supporting robot development and research in robotics by providing a modular and general purpose software framework; yet, at a lower level, i.e., mechanics, electronics, and firmware, component-based robotics is still in its early stages. Moreover, basic functionalities, such as robust odometry and pose tracking, seem to be solved on an ad-hoc basis, while no generic solution can be plugged in a system as an off-the-shelf component. This paper presents two modular tools for the development of robotics applications and how these can be deployed on different robot platforms as off-the-shelf, open hardware and open software, components at the hardware, firmware, and core software levels. A case study based on two mobile platforms is described showing how it is possible to reuse physical components in the building of a mobile robot and provide an off-the-shelf architecture which sports multi-sensor fusion for robust odometry and pose tracking, requiring a fraction of the effort with respect to ad hoc techniques. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - This paper proposes a new cost-effective data acquisition system using open-source hardware and Matlab/Simulink. The proposed data acquisition (DAQ) system has features that it uses the framed data protocol based on hex encoding, it can acquire multiple data which are not of the same type at different sample rates, and the system receives data through USB communication or serial communication. The software of the proposed system consists of the firmware of a microcontroller and user-defined Simulink function block. The firmware of a microcontroller is in the form of a header file, and the data acquisition can be easily achieved by calling a few functions defined in the header file. The developed user-defined Simulink block can get multiple data at different sample rates by configuring the GUI parameters appropriately. For implementation of the system, we use the Arch Max, which is the open-source hardware with an ARM Cortex-M4 core, and also use a user-defined c-code S-function of Matlab/Simulink. For the demonstration of the superiority of the implemented system, we compare the proposed system's performance with that of the data acquisition system provided in Matlab/Simulink Instrument Control Toolbox. Finally we illustrate how presented system can be actually used by applying the proposed system to DC motor control. © Copyright 2016 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

AB  - Marine processes are observed with sensors from both the ground and space over large spatio-temporal scales. Citizen-based contributions can fill observational gaps and increase environmental stewardship amongst the public. For this purpose, tools and methods for citizen science need to (1) complement existing datasets; and (2) be affordable, while appealing to different user and developer groups. In this article, tools and methods developed in the 7th Framework Programme of European Union (EU FP 7) funded project Citclops (citizens' observatories for coast and ocean optical monitoring) are reviewed. Tools range from a stand-alone smartphone app to devices with Arduino and 3-D printing, and hence are attractive to a diversity of users; from the general public to more specified maker- and open labware movements. Standardization to common water quality parameters and methods allows long-term storage in regular marine data repositories, such as SeaDataNet and EMODnet, thereby providing open data access. Due to the given intercomparability to existing remote sensing datasets, these tools are ready to complement the marine datapool. In the future, such combined satellite and citizen observations may set measurements by the engaged public in a larger context and hence increase their individual meaning. In a wider sense, a synoptic use can support research, management authorities, and societies at large. © 2016 by the authors.

AB  - Developing countries and rural areas face an endemic lack of adequate electrical infrastructure. Electrical energy availability is critical in the alleviation of poverty and enables rural residents to participate in the broader economy. Ad hoc solutions form electrical nano-grids which consist of local electrical generation (typically using diesel generators, wind turbines or solar arrays) with electrical distribution done typically with household extension cords. Usually no metering is performed by the power producers, and therefore a flat rate is charged to all customers. The M.I.T. Media Lab and Schneider-Electric have a proposed low cost solution based on rugged, open source hardware and software which is easily, customized, and enhanced by entrepreneurs.

AB  - The Daytona Beach Homeschoolers consists of the tenth grade students Abigail Butka and Nick Serle. This team was the youngest and smallest team entered in the Robo boat 2015 competition. The team's boat completed many tasks and fin-ished in 4th place overall, beating several collegiate teams. The small team was very budget constrained and used open source hardware and software to address the technical requirements. This paper describes how the S.S. Minnow team was able to compete in the Robo Boat competition with a $600 budget. Topics in this paper include: the overall strategy to accomplish the competition tasks, vision processing techniques, and the hardware chosen for the S.S. Minnow. The paper concludes with summarizing the entry's performance in the competition and an-alyzing the successes and proposing fixes to the problems that were identified.

AB  - The main concern about commercial activity trackers from companies like Fitbit, Sony, Polar, Garmin and others is that users don’t own their data and they don’t have control about how their data is used by the companies. That’s why we started developing an open hardware and open source alternative: okinesio. In our paper we are presenting the results and lessons learned from our first year of developing of open hardware. We are describing the methods and results of our evaluation of a range of top-selling activity trackers regarding accuracy, underlying hardware sensors, user experience and data accessibility. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - Soldercubes are a self-reconfiguring modular robot (MR) system whose modules are light weight, low cost, and designed with manufacturability for large batch production in mind. The frequently cited promises of modular robotics—versatility, robustness, and low cost—assume the availability of large numbers of modules. However, modules in most MR prototypes are large, mechanically complex, expensive, and difficult to manufacture. Soldercubes partially overcome this contradiction through optimizing some components for volume manufacturing processes. With the integration of a soldering connector which weighs only 2 g and has no moving parts, Soldercubes are among the cheapest, lightest and smallest among comparable self-reconfiguring MR systems. This paper describes the Soldercube module design in detail, reports on experiments in a lattice configuration, explores non-lattice applications of the system, and discusses the effects of utilising volume manufacturing processes in module production. All Soldercubes design files are released as open source hardware. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The inclusion of people with disabilities and their circle of stakeholders in the design and deployment of digital assistive technology is increasingly being recognized as important. The Do-It-Yourself Assistive Technology (DIY-AT) approach investigates methodologies and tools to support accessible making practices. In prior work, we successfully used a DIY-AT approach to develop TalkBox, an open-source directselection communication board for those with little or no functional verbal communication. In this paper, we describe a follow-up project in which we use TalkBox as a prototyping platform to facilitate co-design and co-fabrication of DIY-AT. We present results from (1) a workshop in which users with disabilities and their parents/caregivers fabricated their own TalkBoxes, and (2) a collaborative co-design session with a nonverbal child and his mother wherein the potential for TalkBox variants led to novel design decisions. We illustrate the outcome of our process by describing the multi-vocabulary variant called Hot Swappable Talk- Box, in which RFID technology is used to afford easy switching among different vocabulary sets. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - The amateur and university rocketry communities are rapidly reaching higher altitudes with more sophisticated rockets. However, most groups are still using heavy airframes made of metal or fiberglass. Commercial off-the-shelf airframes are either too expensive for low-budget university groups or too small to use as a platform for high altitude experiments. A capstone team of mechanical engineering seniors at Portland State University has developed a low-weight, modular carbon fiber airframe as an open-hardware technology for university rocketry. This project continues the work of a 2014 capstone team, who developed a carbon fiber layup process with promising results. This will enable low-budget groups like the Portland State Aerospace Society to explore high altitude science and compete in the university space race. © 2016, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

AB  - The development of techniques for the rapid analysis of N-glycans is a key step in enabling the roles of glycoproteins in biological processes to be studied. Analysis is usually performed through the liberation of the carbohydrate moieties from proteins, followed by fluorescent labeling and identification using either standardized HPLC or mass spectrometry techniques. A simple and robust automated process for the release and isolation of N-glycans would greatly improve analytical throughput and reproducibility, and is thus highly desirable. Inspired by the increasing number of reported projects involving open source labware, which allows the design and construction of otherwise inaccessible laboratory equipment using low-cost 3D printers, we used this technique to fabricate a platform for the automated isolation of N-glycans. As a proof of concept, we demonstrated the successful recovery of glycan samples from the glycoprotein model fetuin using our self-made 3D-printed equipment. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Machines in general and robots in particular, appeal greatly to children and youth. With the widespread availability of low-cost open source hardware and free open source software, robotics has become central to the promotion of STEM education in schools, and active learning at college/university level. With robots, children in developed countries gain from technological immersion, or exposure to the latest technologies and gadgets. Yet, developing countries like India still lag in the use of robots at school and even college level In this paper, an innovative and low-cost educational outdoor mobile robot is developed for deployment by school children during volunteer trash pickup. The wheeled mobile robot is constructed with inexpensive commercial off-the-shelf components, including single board computer and miscellaneous sensors. It is remote controlled by children using smart phone app or video game controller. The robot is also equipped with air quality sensors to display air pollution levels to the children and public. The project can improve STEM education, environmental literacy and civic engagement among school children, while providing interdisciplinary service learning opportunities for college and university students. Results of a prototype mobile robot design, development, and deployment are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the approach. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Today engineers designing, building, modifying or migrating control systems for accelerators or large physics experiments have free access to very mature, adaptable, reliable, and high-performance control system toolkits, which have been developed by professional, global collaborations. Interconnectivity between the different control systems is well developed, even industrial vendors provide their devices "control system ready". With respect to software and networking, an abundance of solutions and applications is already available. But the collaborative power of sharing, effort and success fades as it comes to non-standardized hardware. FPGA-based boards and recent attempts, like the "open hardware initiative", might move this frontier and open up uncharted waters. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - UVX is a 1.37 GeV synchrotron light source that has been in operation by the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS) since 1997. Its control system, which was completely developed in-house, has received some upgrades lately in order to get around issues from aging, improve performance and reduce maintenance costs. In this way, a new crate controller was designed. It is based on BeagleBone Black single-board computer (SBC) [1], a cheap open hardware and community-supported embedded Linux platform that will be adopted for some control system applications in Sirius [2], the upcoming brazilian light source. In this paper, we describe an overview of the design and results obtained. Copyright © 2017 CC-BY-3.0 and by the respective authors.

AB  - Acoustic recorders are the primary tool used in marine bioacoustics; however, available devices are either expensive or lack self-calibration capabilities that are critical for high-quality measurements. Moreover, the software used in proprietary designs can be inflexible and may involve unknown processing steps. To address this, we have designed a miniature low-cost yet high-performance acoustic recorder that features open-source hardware and software. Circuitry is included for self-calibration, making it possible to evaluate device performance in situ. Our intention is that the design will develop in conjunction with the needs of the bioacoustics community. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016.

AB  - Selective openness allows a firm to sell a systemic innovation that combines both open and proprietary technologies. Such firm strategies are now common for open source software and other information goods. However, they pose conceptual and practical uncertainties for hardware-focused companies, particularly as research on open hardware has emphasized community rather than firm success. Here we study firm openness in 3D printing, with a case study of how MakerBot Industries leveraged external communities and selective openness become the consumer market leader. After reviewing the literature on systemic innovation and selective openness, we document the proprietary strategies of a dozen startup companies during the first two decades of the 3D printing industry. We contrast this to the open hardware, software and content strategy that MakerBot's founders used to enter and grow the consumer market from 2009 onward. We show how MakerBot shifted to a selectively open, systemic innovation strategy that complemented proprietary hardware and software with open user-generated content from its Thingiverse online community. From this, we suggest the inherent complementarity of selective openness strategies between open and proprietary components, and conclude with predictions as to when and how a startup or incumbent firm will combine open and proprietary elements. © 2015.

AB  - The reasons for the inferior performance of many existing buildings and associated energy systems are diverse, but an important part-cause is insufficient attention to the influence of occupant behaviour. In smart buildings it is necessary to allow for the integration of human behaviour in the HVAC system. In addition, many researchers are limited in their investigation by not having low cost tools that can provide information for their studies. This article is a review of the present state of art about the globe thermometer. It describes how to build your own globe temperature sensor and describes experiments that illustrate the feasibility of using a black globe thermometer with 40 mm diameter.

AB  - In December 2013 the management of the International Airports of Rome (ADR) decided to assign me to project a fire safety system similar to EN 81-73: 2005[1], for the lifts installed in Leonardo da Vinci Airport of Rome Fiumicino. The specific requirement of the Direction of the airport was to implement a fully automatic system, with no human supervision, to prevent passengers in a lift to be stranded on a floor, or trapped in a lift, where a fire has broken out. The Direction of ADR added some further specific project requirements: - The hardware and software of the system was to have "open" architecture - The system had to be reliable and with a high level of safety; - Reduce to a minimum the probability of false alarms and safeguard the capability of the system to start with a real fire alarm. The Satellite terminal G gates were chosen to start the project. Escalators and moving walks (EMWs) have also been included in the system. To reduce the probability of false alarms a 3D simulation model of a map of fire sensors, based on about 1400 sensors in the Terminal and statistical data coming from about 18,000 fire sensors, has been prepared and verified. The requirements of open hardware (PLCs (Programmable Logic Computers) and electronic equipment) and open software (PLC and SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) software) have been fully accomplished and the system is now operative in the Terminal G gates. ADR management has recently decided to extend the system to the rest of Leonardo da Vinci Airport. The FEMS project has been recently approved for lifts, escalators and moving walks in public transport by the Italian Ministero delle Infrastrutture e Trasporti (Italian Infrastructures and Transports Authority). © 2016 The University of Northampton, The CIBSE Lifts Group, LEIA and the authors.

AB  - The advent of massively interconnected objects, devices, and sensors raises equally substantial challenges regarding the resources that will allow makers to manage the complexity of such systems and to exploit the opportunities such technologies open up. Simplicity in management and a smooth, creative integration of everyday life objects empowered by digital technology in our own environment are two key factors for a successful penetration of Internet of Things (IoT). We present UDOO IoT, a combined set of open hardware (UDOO Quad, Blu and Bricks) and open software (UAPPI, an extension of MIT App Inventor) technologies that allow novices from their early steps in the maker's world to create their own digital objects connected to the cloud, easily defining custom behavior logic for sensors and actuators. UDOO IoT is illustrated through one of the field studies carried out along its design process.

AB  - This paper presents an open platform, which collects multimodal environmental data related to air quality from several sources including official open sources, social media and citizens. Collecting and fusing different sources of air quality data into a unified air quality indicator is a highly challenging problem, leveraging recent advances in image analysis, open hardware, machine learning and data fusion. The collection of data from multiple sources aims at having complementary information, which is expected to result in increased geographical coverage and temporal granularity of air quality data. This diversity of sources constitutes also the main novelty of the platform presented compared with the existing applications. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.

AB  - Precision Agriculture in conjunction with Variable Rate Technology aims at increasing productivity while reducing resource usage (water, fertilizers, pesticides and others). Within this context, the farm's management decisions include information from data collected about the crops health development, which need to be gathered in a timely basis. There are several means of obtaining information about the plants health, including manual data collection from sensors installed in the soil and/or its vicinity, mobile sensor systems, for example embedded sensors in UAVs, or aircrafts, or other vehicles, and satellite imagery, to name just a few examples. The adoption of UAVs in such applications has gaining a lot of attention in recent years due to ease of access, low cost and available flight control software. UAV systems may carry several sensors, which include RGB, infrared, multispectral and hyper-spectral cameras. These cameras are respectively more powerful, in terms of data quality, as well as more expensive. The current paper contribution include the platform model, design and characterization of a multispectral camera system made from two low cost, commercial of the shelf cameras that can be integrated in a small UAV. These aforementioned cameras are compatible with open source hardware, namely Raspberry Pi boards, that are used to collect, process and store information. © 2016

AB  - In order to cope with the challenges of sustainability, systematic methods have been developed for improving the ratio between usefulness and environmental impact of products. These necessary efforts are however constrained if the surrounding business model patterns are not challenged at the same time. In this article, open source design (OSD) is presented as a potential concept leading towards alternative and eco-efficient production and consumption patterns. Potential advantages of OSD for environmental sustainability are hypothesized and confronted with the analysis of the environmental friendliness of four open source products. Two synergies between sustainable design and OSD are identified (product modularity and design for local manufacturing) as well as corresponding challenges for further research. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - There are some data centers that are located far from the main data center for ensuring continuity of company's Information Technology operations in case the main data center encounters a serious downtime especially for companies engaged to work in distributed manner to increase quality-of -service to their customers. Environmental downtime is a significant cost to organizations and makes them unable to do business because what happens in the data center affects everyone. In addition, the amount of electrical energy consumed by data center increases with the amount of computing power installed. One strategy of reducing energy consumption in data centers is to adjust the temperature and humidity data. Installation of physical Information Technology and facilities related to environment on monitoring temperature, humidity, power, flood, smoke, air flow, room entry is the most proactive way to reduce the unnecessary costs of expensive hardware replacement or unplanned downtime and decrease energy consumed by servers. In this paper, we present remote system for monitoring auxiliary data centers implemented using open-source hardware platforms, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and the Gobetwino. The objective of collecting temperature and humidity data allows monitoring server's health and gets alerts if things start to go wrong. When the temperature hits 50oC., the supervisor at remote headquarters would get a SMS, then take appropriate actions that make sense to reduce electrical costs and preserve functionality of servers in auxiliary data centers. The data center environmental monitoring represents a step forward towards addressing awareness monitoring of energy efficiency and data centers located far with ability to receive a notification by email.

AB  - Wireless sensor networks (WSN) are recognized key enablers for the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm since its inception. WSNs are a resilient and effective distributed data collection technology, but issues related to reliability, autonomy, cost, and accessibility to application domain experts still limit their wide scale use. Commercial solutions can effectively address vertical application domains, but they often lead to technology lock-ins that limit horizontal composability and reuse. We review some important barriers that hinder WSN use in IoT applications and highlight the main effort and cost components. With these elements in mind, we propose an open hardware-software development platform that can optimize the value flow between technologies and actors with stakes in WSN applications. To reach its objectives, the platform fosters reuse, low-effort low-risk fast prototyping accessible to application domain experts, easy integration of new technology and IP blocks, and simplifies the permeation of research results in commercial applications. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.

AB  - Health monitoring is nowadays one of the hottest markets due to the increasing interest in prevention and treatment of physical problems. In this context the development of wearable, wireless, open-source, and nonintrusive sensing solutions is still an open problem. Indeed, most of the existing commercial architectures are closed and provide little flexibility. In this paper, an open hardware architecture for designing a modular wireless sensor node for health monitoring is proposed. By separating the connection and sensing functions in two separate boards, compliant with the IEEE1451 standard, we add plug and play capabilities to analog transducers, while granting at the same time a high level of customization. As an additional contribution of the work, we developed a cosimulation tool which simplifies the physical connection with the hardware devices and provides support for complex systems. Finally, a wireless body area network for fall detection and health monitoring, based on wireless node prototypes realized according to the proposed architecture, is presented as an application scenario. © 2016 L.

AB  - We implemented an educational program, based on the use of free software and low-cost open hardware, to excite high school students' curiosity about seismic-hazard issues and to engage them in the process of learning the best practices of seismic safety. This program was developed in a senior class at the high school Liceo Paschini in Tolmezzo (northeast Italy). The students under the supervision of their physics teacher and seismologists, used an Arduino board, ADXL345 accelerometers, and open-source software to create a low-cost seismometer able to record local strong motion. In this article, we provide a "how-To" (instructional) guide to enable other students to reproduce the experiment. Certain introductory lessons in computer sciences and electronics were required for the students to acquire the necessary skills and to fill gaps in their background knowledge. In addition, lectures by seismologists and specific laboratory activities allowed the class to explore different aspects of the physics of earthquakes, particularly of the seismic waves, and to become familiar with seismic-hazard topics through inquiry-based learning. We believe that this exercise is a good example of how earthquake issues can be taught through a multidisciplinary approach in subjects traditionally covered by scientific and technological disciplines.

AB  - Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) are promising communication devices between humans and machines. BCI based on non-invasive neuroimaging techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG) have many applications, however the dissemination of the technology is limited, in part because of the price of the hardware. In this paper we compare side by side two EEG amplifiers, the consumer grade OpenBCI and the medical grade g.tec g. USBamp. For this purpose, we employed an original montage, based on the simultaneous recording of the same set of electrodes. Two set of recordings were performed. During the first experiment a simple adapter with a direct connection between the amplifiers and the electrodes was used. Then, in a second experiment, we attempted to discard any possible interference that one amplifier could cause to the other by adding "ideal" diodes to the adapter. Both spectral and temporal features were tested - the former with a workload monitoring task, the latter with an visual P300 speller task. Overall, the results suggest that the OpenBCI board - or a similar solution based on the Texas Instrument ADS1299 chip - could be an effective alternative to traditional EEG devices. Even though a medical grade equipment still outperforms the OpenBCI, the latter gives very close EEG readings, resulting in practice in a classification accuracy that may be suitable for popularizing BCI uses.

AB  - The Stanford "Lab-In-A-Box" project comprises an open source hardware and software tool chain for teaching signal processing and analog electronics. It is intended to improve the teaching of these concepts by providing a platform that is more open and understandable and by lowering the economic barriers to students interested in the field. To do this, the Lab-In-A-Box brings a full powered Digital Signal Processor (DSP) core to the popular Arduino microcontroller environment and marries it with a simple to use analog front end (AFE). The software platform provided with the Lab-In-A-Box includes an Arduino-like development environment that facilitates learning and quick development of signal processing applications without abstracting away the intricacies of a practical implementation. This system has been used to create several teaching examples and has been tested in courses at Stanford University. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents a design for a low-cost research robot based on the chassis of a Hexbug Spider, a remote controlled toy robot. Our modification replaces the robot head with a 3d printed adapter part which provides space for sensors, a larger battery, and a microcontroller board. In a second part of the paper we address the manufacturing process of such a robot. The presented robot costs far less than 100 Euro and is suitable for swarm robotic experiments. The hexapod locomotion makes the robot attractive for applications where a two wheel differential drive cannot be used. Our modification is published as open hardware and open source to allow further customizations. © 2015 Universita Politecnica dell Marche.

AB  - This paper presents the design of a Detection System Crisis Episodes of depression in older adults. The system allows monitoring wirelessly through two modules: movement patterns and physiological markers of the patient. The first module is open technology based as is Raspberry Pi and Open CV to process images to identify movement patterns. The second module uses an Arduino pro mini with temperature and pulse sensor to logging information of the physiological data (heart rate and temperature). The information obtained is processed on a Web server through an application for viewing in a Web page or mobile device. With this information the attending physician or can correlate the variability of heart rate, temperature and movement pattern and determine by monitoring the state of the Depression in Elderly. This system is designed to send alert messages via MSN to physician and family in emergency situations such as extreme temperatures, irregular heartbeat, and absence or excess movement. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - During a disaster, conventional communications infrastructures are often compromised, which prevents local populations from contacting family, friends, and colleagues. The lack of communication also impedes responder efforts to gather, organize, and disseminate information. This problem is made worse by the unique cost and operational constraints typically associated with the humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) space. In response, we present a low-cost, scalable system that creates a wide-area, best-effort, ad-hoc wireless network for emergency information. The Communication Assistance Technology over Ad-Hoc Networks (CATAN) system embraces the maker and do it yourself (DIY) communities by leveraging open-source and hobbyist technologies to create cheap, lightweight, battery-powered nodes that can be deployed quickly for a variety of operations. CATAN enables geographically separated users to share information on standard interfaces, i.e. web and SMS, over commonly-used communication interfaces, i.e. GSM and Wi-Fi. These interfaces enable CATAN to accommodate a variety of digital devices while leveraging the global ubiquity of cellular devices. By emphasizing simple, mature, technologies, CATAN avoids many problems that hinder many general purpose ad-hoc technologies. We have tested our infrastructure in a variety of environments and have open-sourced the entire project to encourage collaboration with the greater HADR community. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - To provide process optimization of metal fabricating self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) 3-D printers requires a low-cost sensor and data logger system to measure current (I) and voltage (V) of the gas metal arc welders (GMAW). This paper builds on previous open-source hardware development to provide a real-time measurement of welder I-V where the measuring circuit is connected to two analog inputs of the Arduino that is used to control the 3-D printer itself. Franklin firmware accessed through a web interface that is used to control the printer allows storing the measured values and downloading those stored readings to the user's computer. To test this custom current and voltage monitoring device this study reports on its use on an upgraded all metal RepRap during the printing of aluminum alloy (ER1100, ER4043, ER4943, ER4047, and ER5356). The voltage and current data were analyzed on a per alloy basis and also layer-by-layer in order to evaluate the device's efficacy as a monitoring device for 3-D printing and the results of the integrated design are discussed. © 2015 by the authors.

AB  - IN THE WAKE OF the Fukushima disaster in 2011, a lot of people in Japan felt the government was not giving them enough information about radiation, so many went out and bought their own Geiger counters. Supplies quickly ran dry, so a group gathered in Tokyo's Hackerspace to design and build their own under the name Safecast. Before they did anything, they consulted the Internet. Joichi Ito, director of the MIT Media Lab and founding member of Safecast, explained at the group's anniversary and conference in March this year: "When we had the earthquake, most of us didn't know about radiation or even starting up communities. We called out on the Internet, asking: 'Do you know anything about this?' Someone would say 'I know the person who did the monitoring sensors for Three Mile Island'. "We put together quite a good team having started from zero. We couldn't have designed this as quickly without open hardware or without the help of the Internet. That is a big trend that we are seeing the beginning of." The result of the hacking project was the bGeigie, a combination of a Geiger counter, GPS receiver and data recorder. Users submit their data to the Safecast database by uploading it from the bGeigie's SD card, usually from a network-enabled computer rather than the device itself. Ray Ozzie, former chief software architect of Microsoft and the adviser to Safecast, came up with the idea of putting the small initial number of handmade Geiger counters on the outside of car windows, so they could be driven round to maximise the number of readings around Japan that the team could record.

AB  - Fire detection and protection are major problems in factories. A closely related problem is to localize fire sources to effectively extinguish those. In this paper we presented development of a moderate cost wireless sensor network based fire detection system with indoor localization capability. In Bangladesh, where large numbers of garment factories are located suffers fire incidents every year. The aim of our work was to develop fire detection system that could help the garment owners to install reliable fire detection systems with localizing capability within a relatively lower cost. As such, we have used open source hardware and software tools to develop our system and documented our approach well, so that it can be replicated anywhere. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Performance improvements of a single-core processor relying on high clock rates reached the limit. Instead of a single-core processor, multi-core and many-core processors have been mainstream to accelerate applications by parallel processing. Year by year, the number of cores integrated in a single chip has been increased due to improvements of semiconductor integration technologies depending on Moore's Law. On the other hand, Moore's Law will be ended in the near future. This means that the approaches relying on the increase in the number of cores will be hopeless, thus we have to consider other effective ways. One of them is to design application specific hardware. Several research organizations have explored it and reported its remarkable findings. We focus on such an acceleration approach with dedicated hardware. As a case study with dedicated hardware, we present a sorting acceleration method. Sorting is an extremely important computation kernel that should be accelerated in a lot of fields, such as databases, image processing, data compression, etc. We propose a sorting accelerator combining Sorting Network and Merge Sorter Tree, and detail the design and implementation. Our proposed sorting accelerator is customizable, thus designers can implement a sorting accelerator composed of required hardware resources by means of tuning design parameters. Our experiments show that the proposed hardware achieves up to 10.06x sorting performance, compared with Intel Core i7-4770 operating at 3.4GHz, when sorting 256M 32-bits integer elements. In order to allow every designer to easily and freely use this accelerator, the RTL source code is released as an open-source hardware. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Wearable robotics is strongly oriented to humans. New applications for wearable robots are encouraged by the lightness and portability of new devices and the progress in human-robot cooperation strategies. In this paper, we propose the different design guidelines to realize a robotic extra-finger for human grasping enhancement. Such guidelines were followed for the realization of three prototypes obtained using rapid prototyping techniques, i.e., a 3D printer and an open hardware development platform. Both fully actuated and under-Actuated solutions have been explored. In the proposed wearable design, the robotic extra-finger can be worn as a bracelet in its rest position. The availability of a supplementary finger in the human hand allows to enlarge its workspace, improving grasping and manipulation capabilities. This preliminary work is a first step towards the development of robotic extra-limbs able to increase human workspace and dexterity. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - During last years unmanned ground and aerial vehicles captured the attention of researchers and companies, while the available set of Unmanned Surface Vehicle platforms is smaller. In many scenarios an integrated approach is required considering a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles. In this paper we focus on the development of a low-cost unmanned surface platform for digital surveys. The boat has been designed to navigate also in shallow water owing to a low draft design. An embedded system with Robot Operating System (ROS) onboard has been deployed on the surface vehicle. One of the main advantages of the proposed solution is its reduced cost owing to open-hardware/software solutions. In particular, an open-hardware solution is responsible for the interfacing of an RTK GPS with a bathymetric ultrasound sensor to map the sea / lake / river floor. The boat can be either remotely controllable or fully autonomous. An Augmented Reality (AR) application has been also developed to show the path and the set of survey blocks that are mapped / not mapped. The AR application is particularly useful when the user remotely controls the boat, but also for supervising the autonomous survey. The performances achieved in the first trials are satisfactory and the AR application produces significant maps. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - The article describes the design phase, development and practical application of a low-cost control system for a forced circulation solar plant in an outdoor test cell located near Milan. Such a system provides for the use of an electric pump for the circulation of heat transfer fluid connecting the solar thermal panel to the storage tank. The running plant temperatures are the fundamental parameter to evaluate the system performance such as proper operation, and the control and management system has to consider these parameters. A solar energy-powered wireless-based smart object was developed, able to monitor the running temperatures of a solar thermal system and aimed at moving beyond standard monitoring approaches to achieve a low-cost and customizable device, even in terms of installation in different environmental conditions. To this end, two types of communications were used: the first is a low-cost communication based on the ZigBee protocol used for control purposes, so that it can be customized according to specific needs, while the second is based on a Bluetooth protocol used for data display. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The new technology ensures 3D laparoscopic vision by adding depth to the traditional two dimensions. This realistic vision gives the surgeon the feeling of operating in real space. Hospital of Treviglio-Caravaggio isn't an university or scientific institution; in 2014 a new 3D laparoscopic technology was acquired therefore it led to evaluation of the of the appropriateness in term of patient outcome and safety. The project aims at achieving the development of a quantitative validation model that would ensure low cost and a reliable measure of the performance of 3D technology versus 2D mode. In addition, it aims at demonstrating how new technologies, such as open source hardware and software and 3D printing, could help research with no significant cost increase. For these reasons, in order to define criteria of appropriateness in the use of 3D technologies, it was decided to perform a study to technically validate the use of the best technology in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and safety in the use of a system between laparoscopic vision in 3D and the traditional 2D. METHODS: 30 surgeons were enrolled in order to perform an exercise through the use of laparoscopic forceps inside a trainer. The exercise consisted of having surgeons with different level of seniority, grouped by type of specialization (eg. surgery, urology, gynecology), exercising videolaparoscopy with two technologies (2D and 3D) through the use of a anthropometric phantom. The target assigned to the surgeon was that to pass "needle and thread" without touching the metal part in the shortest time possible. The rings selected for the exercise had each a coefficient of difficulty determined by depth, diameter, angle from the positioning and from the point of view. RESULTS: The analysis of the data collected from the above exercise has mathematically confirmed that the 3D technique ensures a learning curve lower in novice and greater accuracy in the performance of the task with respect to 2D. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - The design of sensing systems powered from energy harvesting can be complex. Design decisions are required concerning the properties and parameters of energy harvesting, conversion, and storage devices. The quantity and properties of environmental energy are typically both temporally and spatially variant, while the current consumption of the load electronics also changes dynamically. In this paper we describe Enspect, an open-source hardware/software tool which simplifies the design of energy harvesting sensing systems by assisting in the specification of harvesting and storage devices. It does this by enabling the long-term collection of data on energy availability, and modeling and simulating the performance of a complete system.

AB  - Electronic systems are not widely used for measuring biological variables in beehives despite the importance that honeybees have for both the environment and humans. A better understanding of bee colonies is needed in order to prevent certain dangers that threaten the bee population. In this study, we have developed an electronic system based on the Arduino Open Hardware platform, to which we have added temperature and humidity sensors to adapt the system to the particular conditions of beehive management. The system has been used to record changes in temperature and humidity inside hives and assess bees' thermoregulation adaptability within colonies in hives with opened-screened bottom boards; an interesting management tool for controlling the harmful Varroa destructor mite as compared to beehives with conventional closed bottom boards. The results revealed that bee colonies were able to thermoregulate in hives with open anti-Varroa bottom boards to the same degree as those in conventional bottom board hives even under winter conditions in a mediterranean climate, thus indicating that there are no additional risks associated with the use of open-screened bottom board models. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Competitive solutions to the growing demand for home automation will most likely include the use of low cost components, open source and open hardware. Using the ZigBee protocol, a low cost lighting control actuator was developed that was battery efficient and easy to use in a home automation system environment. Raspberry Pi was used to house a Web server, which provided the user an adaptive web application to access the lighting actuator control. XBee modules were chosen for their small size, low energy consumption and the large amount of documentation that exists in regard to its use. Considering the worst-case scenario, the lighting control actuator was designed so if its battery runs out of power or the ZigBee network fails, it can work as a normal light switch. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - We demonstrate the additive manufacturing of complex three-dimensional (3D) biological structures using soft protein and polysaccharide hydrogels that are challenging or impossible to create using traditional fabrication approaches. These structures are built by embedding the printed hydrogel within a secondary hydrogel that serves as a temporary, thermoreversible, and biocompatible support. This process, termed freeform reversible embedding of suspended hydrogels, enables 3D printing of hydrated materials with an elastic modulus <500 kPa including alginate, collagen, and fibrin. Computer-aided design models of 3D optical, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging data were 3D printed at a resolution of ~200 mm and at low cost by leveraging open-source hardware and software tools. Proof-of-concept structures based on femurs, branched coronary arteries, trabeculated embryonic hearts, and human brains were mechanically robust and recreated complex 3D internal and external anatomical architectures. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - We describe a completely randomizable flow-through outdoor mesocosm for climate change and ecotoxicology studies that was built with inexpensive materials. The 16 raceway tanks allow up to 69 water renewal per hour, avoiding changes in natural abiotic seawater conditions. We use an open-source hardware board (Arduino) that was adapted to control heaters and an innovative CO2 injection system. This system reduced seawater pH up to −0.9 units and increased temperature up to +6℃ in three treatments and a control. Treatments can be continuously compared with the control and vary according to diel fluctuations, thus following the diel range observed in the sea. The mesocosm facility also includes an integrated secondary system of 48 aquaria for ecotoxicology studies. We validated the reproducibility and relevance of our experimental system by analyzing the variation of the total DNA of the microbial community extracted from corals in three elevated temperature scenarios during a 40-day experiment. We also present data from temperature, acidification, and copper contamination trials, which allowed continuous, reliable, and consistent treatment manipulations. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - The rise of "Bring Your Own Device" programs, the emergence of wearables and interactive electronics, and the growing presence of the "Internet of Things" in the workplace, all present new challenges to members of the IT profession. To prepare students for this ever-changing landscape, we propose the use of low-cost, wearable badges to introduce learners to central IT concepts in an innovative, engaging, and social way. In this paper, we introduce the CCL-Parallax Programmable Badge - an open-hardware communicative device that uniquely brings together various components of the IT curriculum. Along with introducing the badges and situating them within almost two decades of research on the use of similar devices in educational contexts, we present both theoretical and practical justifications for the use of programmable badges in IT classrooms. The badges highlight the collaborative, social aspects of IT while grounding the learning experience in authentic, motivating, and hands-on activities. © 2015 ACM.

AB  - A long endurance high efficiency Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is being developed by a group of researchers and students in the Mechanical Engineering Technology program at Algonquin College, Ottawa, ON, Canada. The design is based on a tailless, staggered tandem wing configuration, with a carbon fiber frame and electric propulsion. The developed aircraft has a maximum weight of 12.5 kg, well within the 25 kg limit outlined by Transport Canada for permission-free operation. The UAV was designed to fly missions exceeding 24 hours, performing surveillance and oil pipeline monitoring and inspection, either autonomously or under radio control from a ground station, with medium to high payload capacity. This paper describes the process of designing, manufacturing and testing the developed configuration. The operational requirements are delineated as conceptualized by the development team. A description of the prototype development, including aerodynamics, structural and stability performance, and stability derivatives is included, based on data generated through analytical analysis, simulations in the aerodynamics and stability design software, XFLR5, and testing. The configuration was developed and modeled in the software package SolidWorks, leading to the manufacturing plans for the prototype. As this UAV performs radio controlled and autonomous flights, it makes use of the APM Arduplane, which is an open source hardware and software autopilot package. In order to achieve PID tuning, Hardware in the Loop (HIL) simulations were performed between the autopilot board and two computers simultaneously running the Mission Planner software and the flight simulator X-Plane 10 software. A description of this tuning process is provided. The paper concludes with the results of performed flight tests, documenting performance achievements, and an outline of recommendations for further development. Copyright © 2015 SAE International.

AB  - From the rising number of hackerspaces to an increase in hardware start-ups, maker culture is envisioned as an enabler of the next industrial revolution—a source of unhindered technological innovation, a revamp of broken economies and educational systems. Drawing from long-term ethnographic research, this article examines how China’s makers demarcate Chinese manufacturing as a site of expertise in implementing this vision. China’s makers demonstrate that the future of making—if to materialize in the ways currently envisioned by writers, politicians, and scholars of the global tech industry—rests on taking seriously the technological and cultural fabrics of professional making outside familiar information technology innovation hubs like Silicon Valley: making-do, mass production, and reuse. I trace back to China’s first hackerspace, documenting how a collective of makers began to move away from appropriating Western concepts of openness toward promoting China as source for knowledge, creativity, and innovation. This article demonstrates that when China’s makers set up open hardware businesses and articulate a unique culture of “hacking with Chinese characteristics,” they draw boundaries between the professional making they saw embodied in Chinese industrial production and the hobbyist making embodied in Western histories and cultures of hacking. In so doing, they position China as site of both technological and cultural expertise, intervening in dominant conceptions of computing that split manufacturing and innovation along geographical lines. This article contributes to critical scholarship of innovation and making cultures, technological expertise, and authorship. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.

AB  - Near-field radio frequency identification (RFID) tags have a number of unique features such as being wirelessly powered, having ultra low power communication capabilities, small size and low cost. These qualities paired with the increasing availability of commodity near field communication (NFC) enabled smart phones presents a significant opportunity to enable a wide range of new applications and usage scenarios. However, existing NFC tags are mainly used for identification. This demo presents the NFC-WISP, which is an programmable, sensing and computationally enhanced platform designed to explore new RFID enabled sensing and user interface applications. Two example applications using NFC-WISP are showed: one is a battery-free display tag; the other is a real-time temperature tracking and motion indicating tag for cold chain monitoring application.

AB  - Precision agriculture combines the use of information and technology to ensure the best agricultural practices. Obtaining real-time non-invasive information to monitor crops or make yield predictions is a challenge. An approach is to use crop yield models in combination with real-time data used as input in such models. It was demonstrated that it is possible to design an accurate system using open source hardware and open systems to record the input for these models and monitor crops. The system presented has two main components: a device that records environmental parameters and a smartphone application (software) that links this device to a data server in order to process and analyse the information. The solution is scalable in terms of the type of sensors used (i.e. temperature and relative humidity of the air or soil), the rate of information retrieval and so on, so it can be used in various scenarios, including environmental or land policy monitoring. Moreover, this open source hardware can be used by a broad variety of users and is an alternative in poor rural areas because of its low cost compared to other solutions. It can enable increased agricultural production and management of the local environment, bringing new agricultural practices to these areas. Furthermore, progress in the use of this type of technology can help to develop new capabilities for growers. Results of calibration tests and measurements to demonstrate the usefulness of this system in precision agriculture are presented. © 2015 IAgrE.

AB  - The design and implementation of Smart Grids takes usually into account the participation of LV electrical energy consumers (through techniques such as Demand Response). However, there is still a lack of cost effective hardware and software solutions that would allow these consumers to monitor their installation, comprehend their electrical energy consumption, take action towards achieving energy efficiency, and effectively participate in Demand Response programs. This paper aims to address this issue, presenting a complete, open source hardware and software solution, which enables measurements of electrical voltages and currents at the installation main distribution panel, the transmission and storage of the respective data in a personal computer, and their subsequent processing by the Cassandra open source software platform. The analysis of the proposed solution components is followed by results obtained by the implementation in a residential installation. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Computer numerical control (CNC) machines play a central role in modern manufacturing. CNC machining skills provide high-paying manufacturing jobs to graduates of engineering and technology. Hands-on laboratory instruction is essential for effective student learning in the area of CAD/CAM/Manufacturing Technology, but the high cost of commercial and even educational CNC machines like mills and lathes constrains the scope of instruction in CNC machining. In this paper, an inexpensive two-axis lathe prototype is developed using off-the-shelf materials and components, open source hardware, and open source CAM and CNC software. The machine can be adapted for large scale use in engineering colleges, polytechnics, and industrial training institutes (ITIs). To make the CNC learning even more affordable, accessible and less resource-intensive, a web-based learning platform for using the lathe is developed. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - With over a decade of intensive research and development, wireless sensor network (WSN) technology has been emerging as a feasible solution to many innovative applications. In this paper, we describe a wireless sensor network system that we have developed using open-source hardware platforms, Raspberry Pi and zigbee. The system is low-cost, low power consuming and highly scalable both in terms of the type of sensors and the number of sensor nodes, which makes it well suited for a wide variety of applications related to environmental monitoring. Raspberry Pi is cheap, flexible, fully customizable and programmable small computer embedded linux board and abilities of its usage as WSN node and sensor node. Raspberry Pi works as a base station which connects the sensor nodes via zigbee protocol in the wireless sensor network and collects sensors data from different sensors, and supply multi-clients services including data display. The client can visit the base station remotely via (website) Ethernet or command console. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - A plenitude of technology is neither developed in-house nor simply outsourced in dyadic relationships. Instead, we are in a new age where technologies are developed by a networked community of actors and organizations, which base their relations dynamically to each other on a common interest. Such dynamic and networked complexity of technology development is often theoretical explored around the concept of platform, and more recently by employing the concept of ecosystem in an analogy to natural ecosystems. Following the success of open-source software, academics have long been examining openness in digital platforms/ecosystems; however most contributions take the perspective of a single stakeholder from the many that constitute a digital platform/ecosystem. Predominantly, they take the sole perspective of platform providers, those bundling hardware and software or more rarely, the perspective of third-party software developers developing valuable software 'apps' that add value to the overall platform. In this conceptual article, we grasp openness more holistically, both by acknowledging that openness means different things to different people and involve all stakeholders within the platforms/ecosystems. Towards the development of a theory of openness within digital settings, we propose six novel aspects of openness for enabling a greater understanding of the open-source software movement with a digital platforms/ecosystems perspective. Moreover, we invite scholars to reconsider the more predominating product-dominant logic in open-source software research to a more holistic logic embracing platforms and ecosystem thinking.

AB  - This study provides an in-depth investigation into low-cost and no-cost substrate release mechanisms that allow gas metal arc weld 3-D printed ER4043 aluminum and ER70S-6 steel parts to be removed from a reusable print substrate with minimal energy. Aluminum oxide, boron nitride, and titanium nitride coatings were evaluated as possible substrate release agents for aluminum printing. Additionally, the in situ formation of substrate release agents such as intermetallics and oxides were tested for both aluminum and steel printing. Testing was performed with a modified Charpy impact tester to remove 3-D printed metal parts from an 1100 aluminum or A36 low carbon steel print substrate to assess the impact energy required for removal. Specimen porosity was measured prior to sectioning and microstructural analysis, hardness traverses were measured across the specimens, and the elastic and shear moduli of the parts were analyzed via ultrasonic methods. All of the employed substrate release mechanisms minimized weld penetration and, in some instances, formed a brittle phase with the print substrate that allowed the specimens to be removed with minimal impact energy. These results thus provide methods with the removal of metal 3-D printed parts from print substrates with no specialized tooling or equipment conducive to distributed manufacturing. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We present a novel approach to developing a vehicle communication platform consisting of a low-cost, open-source hardware for moving vehicle data to a secure server, a Web Application Programming Interface (API) for the provision of third-party services, and an intuitive user dashboard for access control and service distribution. The CloudThink infrastructure promotes the commoditization of vehicle telematics data by facilitating easier, flexible, and more secure access. It enables drivers to confidently share their vehicle information across multiple applications to improve the transportation experience for all stakeholders, as well as to potentially monetize their data. The foundations for an application ecosystem have been developed which, taken together with the fair value for driving data and low barriers to entry, will drive adoption of CloudThink as the standard method for projecting physical vehicles into the cloud. The application space initially consists of a few fundamental and important applications (vehicle tethering and remote diagnostics, road-safety monitoring, and fuel economy analysis) but as CloudThink begins to gain widespread adoption, the multiplexing of applications on the same data structure and set will accelerate its adoption. © 2015 © 2015 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press.

AB  - Today, open source software plays a significant role in information technology and consumer electronics. Open source hardware, which is the free exchange of a product's design information, is gaining popularity as well. Both ideologies are motivated by trading away competition against collaboration. In this paper we suggest the application of the open source movement to space technology. In the focus of our discussion are CubeSats, considered as an ideal playground for the introduction of technological and methodological novelties. We examine the legal background of open source designs and contrast the advantages of open source products for developers and users against closed source products. We then present an open source initiative for CubeSat technologies with the intention to encourage the CubeSat community to move towards open design. © 2015 IAA.Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Sustainability has become a major concern in many countries and is leading to strict regulations regarding the impact of products and services during their manufacturing, use, and disposal. Power consumption monitoring in manufacturing companies can lead to a reduction of machine tools energy wastes and consequently to lower expenses. To this end, a complete transparency of energy usage among the entire manufacturing facilities is required. Despite the small volume of material processed, micro manufacturing processes are energy intensive and the optimization of energy usage becomes critical for manufacturing sustainability. Electrical discharge machining (EDM) is considered an attractive solution for the manufacturing of microcomponents. In this paper, a low cost and modular data acquisition system, based on open-hardware and open-source software, for online energy consumption monitoring, is presented. The system described is applied for energy efficiency analysis of the micro EDM milling process by using a state of the art commercial machine tool. A number of sensors is connected to the data acquisition system to measure the energy consumption of the main sub-systems of the machine tool, data is recorded through a microcontroller, and sent to the main computer via Wi-Fi for data storage and analysis. Results show that the process efficiency depends on machine parameters but it is always far below 0.01 %. Solutions are suggested to improve the energy efficiency of the machine tool considered in this work. © 2015, Springer-Verlag London.

AB  - The Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) refers to the quality of the environment in relation to the health and well-being of the occupants. It is a holistic concept, which considers several categories, each related to a specific environmental parameter. This article describes a low-cost and open-source hardware architecture able to detect the indoor variables necessary for the IEQ calculation as an alternative to the traditional hardware used for this purpose. The system consists of some sensors and an Arduino board. One of the key strengths of Arduino is the possibility it affords of loading the script into the board’s memory and letting it run without interfacing with computers, thus granting complete independence, portability and accuracy. Recent works have demonstrated that the cost of scientific equipment can be reduced by applying open-source principles to their design using a combination of the Arduino platform and a 3D printer. The evolution of the 3D printer has provided a new means of open design capable of accelerating self-directed development. The proposed nano Environmental Monitoring System (nEMoS) instrument is shown to have good reliability and it provides the foundation for a more critical approach to the use of professional sensors as well as for conceiving new scenarios and potential applications. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Technology is changing at a rapid rate, opening up new possibilities within the health care domain. Advances such as open source hardware, personal medical devices, and mobile phone apps are creating opportunities for custom-made medical devices and personalized care. However, they also introduce new challenges in balancing the need for regulation (ensuring safety and performance) with the need to innovate flexibly and efficiently. Compared with the emergence of new technologies, health technology design standards and regulations evolve slowly, and therefore, it can be difficult to apply these standards to the latest developments. For example, current regulations may not be suitable for approaches involving open source hardware, an increasingly popular way to create medical devices in the maker community. Medical device standards may not be flexible enough when evaluating the usability of mobile medical devices that can be used in a multitude of different ways, outside of clinical settings. Similarly, while regulatory guidance has been updated to address the proliferation of health-related mobile phone apps, it can be hard to know if and when these regulations apply. In this viewpoint, we present three examples of novel medical technologies to illustrate the types of regulatory issues that arise in the current environment. We also suggest opportunities for support, such as advances in the way we review and monitor medical technologies. © 2015 JMIR Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - One often-overlooked factor when selecting a platform for large-scale electrophysiology is whether or not a particular data acquisition system is 'open' or 'closed': that is, whether or not the system's schematics and source code are available to end users. Open systems have a reputation for being difficult to acquire, poorly documented, and hard to maintain. With the arrival of more powerful and compact integrated circuits, rapid prototyping services, and web-based tools for collaborative development, these stereotypes must be reconsidered. We discuss some of the reasons why multichannel extracellular electrophysiology could benefit from open-source approaches and describe examples of successful community-driven tool development within this field. In order to promote the adoption of open-source hardware and to reduce the need for redundant development efforts, we advocate a move toward standardized interfaces that connect each element of the data processing pipeline. This will give researchers the flexibility to modify their tools when necessary, while allowing them to continue to benefit from the high-quality products and expertise provided by commercial vendors. © 2014.

AB  - Objective: 3-D printing technologies have the potential to improve both Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education and Career and Technical Education (CTE), as well as integrating these two educational emphases and providing opportunities for cross-curriculum engagement. The objective of this study is to investigate the potential of open-source (OS) technologies in an educational setting, given the combination of economic constraints affecting all educational environments and the ability of OS design to profoundly decrease the cost of technological tools and technological innovation. Methods: This paper reports on a 3-day workshop augmented with online instructional and visual tools designed for middle school and high school level educators from a wide array of disciplines (including traditional science, math, and engineering as well as computer, shop, and art). Teachers (n=22) submitted applications to participate in the workshop, the workshop was observed for both evaluation and research, teachers participated in focus groups (n=2) during the workshop in order to discuss their interest in OS 3-D printing technology and its potential role in their classrooms, and teachers completed a voluntary post-workshop survey and responded to follow-up after printers were in the classroom for one year. Results: During the workshop teachers built 3-D printers using OS technologies that they were then able to take back to their schools and into their classrooms. Conclusion: Through workshops augmented with online instructional and visual tools designed to provide facilitated yet self-directed engagement with a new, relatively unknown, and relatively complex technology, paired teacher teams were able to successfully build and use RepRap 3-D printers based on OS design in just three days. Practice: Here, we discuss both what the teachers learned and what we learned from the teachers regarding the potential for educators to construct OS 3-D printing technologies as a tool of empowering and transformative education. Implications: Open-source 3-D printing technologies have the potential to improve education through a sense of empowerment resulting from active participation, as well as through cross-curriculum engagement. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The new open-source quadrotor platform called X4-MaG presented here was developed for academic and research applications. X4-MaG is a small, low-cost open quadrotor of only 307-grammes which offers two levels of controllers providing a manual mode and an automatic mode thanks to powerful Linux-based controller embedded onboard. The experiments presented here show the reliability of the open hardware and software embedded onboard the quadrotor. To estimate the robot s attitude, a quaternion-based complementary filter requiring very few computational resources was developed and implemented on an 8-bit Arduino board. It was also established that the stabilization feedback system based on quaternions tracks the attitude setpoints with precision up to twice greater than a classical cascaded PI controller. The controllers and estimators were designed in the Matlab/Simulink environment and directly implemented onboard the tiny Linux-based autopilot board using a custom made toolbox (RT-MaG toolbox). The autopilot was tested in the brand-new Marseilles Flying Arena with various 3-D flight trajectories and found to be highly accurate with errors of only 0.7cm in hover and less than 3.2cm at 1.2m.s-1. The X4-MaG quadrotor was able to reach speeds greater than 2m.s-1 and reject attitude disturbances of 20′ within 0.8s.

AB  - The Global Food Safety Partnership (GFSP) is a public/private partnership established through the World Bank to improve food safety systems through a globally coordinated and locally-driven approach. This concept paper aims to establish a framework to help GFSP fully leverage the potential of open models. In preparing this paper the authors spoke to many different GFSP stakeholders who asked questions about open models such as: what is it? what's in it for me? why use an open rather than a proprietary model? how will open models generate equivalent or greater sustainable revenue streams compared to the current "traditional? approaches? This last question came up many times with assertions that traditional service providers need to see opportunity for equivalent or greater revenue dollars before they will buy-in. This paper identifies open value propositions for GFSP stakeholders and proposes a framework for creating and structuring that value. Open Educational Resources (OER) were the primary open practice GFSP partners spoke to us about, as they provide a logical entry point for collaboration. Going forward, funders should consider requiring that educational resources and concomitant data resulting from their sponsorship should be open, as a public good. There are, however, many other forms of open practice that bring value to the GFSP. Nine different open strategies and tactics (Appendix A) are described, including: open content (including OER and open courseware), open data, open access (research), open government, open source software, open standards, open policy, open licensing and open hardware. It is recommended that all stakeholders proactively pursue "openness" as an operating principle. This paper presents an overall GFSP Open Ecosystem Engagement Strategy within which specific local case examples can be situated. Two different case examples, China and Colombia, are presented to show both project-based and crowd-sourced, direct-to-public paths through this ecosystem. © 2015 Stacey P et al.

AB  - Non-contacting acoustic and ultrasonic measurements are of interest in applications ranging from nondestructive evaluation to rock physics and medical imaging. The fundamental workings of the detector - the interferometer - are easily explained in undergraduate physics courses, but practical implementations are dominated by specialized, and commercial, devices. We present a robust and relatively inexpensive detector, which consists of a heterodyne interferometer and phase locked loop frequency demodulator, as an open-source alternative. We illustrate the broadband capabilities with the detection of ultrasonic waves in a mudstone sample, and low-frequency (100 Hz) vibrations of a piston. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Conventional deep brain stimulation (DBS) applies constant electrical stimulation to specific brain regions to treat neurological disorders. Closed-loop DBS with real-time feedback is gaining attention in recent years, after proved more effective than conventional DBS in terms of pathological symptom control clinically. Here we demonstrate the conceptualization and validation of a closed-loop DBS system using open-source hardware. We used hippocampal theta oscillations as system input, and electrical stimulation in the mesencephalic reticular formation (mRt) as controller output. It is well documented that hippocampal theta oscillations are highly related to locomotion, while electrical stimulation in the mRt induces freezing. We used an Arduino open-source microcontroller between input and output sources. This allowed us to use hippocampal local field potentials (LFPs) to steer electrical stimulation in the mRt. Our results showed that closed-loop DBS significantly suppressed locomotion compared to no stimulation, and required on average only 56% of the stimulation used in open-loop DBS to reach similar effects. The main advantages of open-source hardware include wide selection and availability, high customizability, and affordability. Our open-source closed-loop DBS system is effective, and warrants further research using open-source hardware for closed-loop neuromodulation.

AB  - Companies that produce open-source hardware are few and far between. At least, they are if you define them in the usual way: an enterprise that provides documentation and permission sufficient for others to re-create, modify, improve, and even make their own versions of the devices it sells. And although open hardware has made strides in recent years-including an increasing number of companies adhering to these practices along with the establishment of the Open Source Hardware Association-it remains a niche industry. You might guess the reason to be simple-such companies must be set up and run by idealists who lack any hardheaded business sense. Not true! What's held back the opensource hardware movement is not a lack of business acumen; it's the rapid evolution of electronic technology. The reasons for this are subtle, but as I will explain below, swift advances in electronic technology inherently favor large closed businesses at the expense of small teams or individual innovators, who benefit most by working with open systems. At least that's the way things have been. But there are changes coming that I expect will tilt the balance the other way. © 1964-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The introduction of affordable, consumer-oriented 3-D printers is a milestone in the current “maker movement,” which has been heralded as the next industrial revolution. Combined with free and open sharing of detailed design blueprints and accessible development tools, rapid prototypes of complex products can now be assembled in one’s own garage—a game-changer reminiscent of the early days of personal computing. At the same time, 3-D printing has also allowed the scientific and engineering community to build the “little things” that help a lab get up and running much faster and easier than ever before. © 2015 Baden et al.

AB  - The concept of the Internet of Things is rapidly becoming a reality, with many applications being deployed within industrial and consumer sectors. At the ‘thing’ level—devices and inter-device network communication—the core technical building blocks are generally the same as those found in wireless sensor network implementations. For the Internet of Things to continue growing, we need more plentiful resources for building intelligent devices and sensor networks. Unfortunately, current commercial devices, e.g., sensor nodes and network gateways, tend to be expensive and proprietary, which presents a barrier to entry and arguably slows down further development. There are, however, an increasing number of open embedded platforms available and also a wide selection of off-the-shelf components that can quickly and easily be built into device and network gateway solutions. The question is whether these solutions measure up to built-for-purpose devices. In the paper, we provide a comparison of existing built-for-purpose devices against open source devices. For comparison, we have also designed and rapidly prototyped a sensor node based on off-the-shelf components. We show that these devices compare favorably to built-for-purpose devices in terms of performance, power and cost. Using open platforms and off-the-shelf components would allow more developers to build intelligent devices and sensor networks, which could result in a better overall development ecosystem, lower barriers to entry and rapid growth in the number of IoT applications. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The need for constant monitoring of environmental conditions has produced an increase in the development of wireless sensor networks (WSN). The drive towards smart cities has produced the need for smart sensors to be able to monitor what is happening in our cities. This, combined with the decrease in hardware component prices and the increase in the popularity of open hardware, has favored the deployment of sensor networks based on open hardware. The new trends in Internet Protocol (IP) communication between sensor nodes allow sensor access via the Internet, turning them into smart objects (Internet of Things and Web of Things). Currently, WSNs provide data in different formats. There is a lack of communication protocol standardization, which turns into interoperability issues when connecting different sensor networks or even when connecting different sensor nodes within the same network. This work presents a sensorized platform proposal that adheres to the principles of the Internet of Things and theWeb of Things. Wireless sensor nodes were built using open hardware solutions, and communications rely on the HTTP/IP Internet protocols. The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) SensorThings API candidate standard was used as a neutral format to avoid interoperability issues. An environmental WSN developed following the proposed architecture was built as a proof of concept. Details on how to build each node and a study regarding energy concerns are presented. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This paper presents a new methodology proposal and hands-on activities in the Introduction to Computer Engineering (ICE) course, based on open hardware platforms. The proposal has been adopted in the Computer Engineering undergraduate program at the Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul (UFMS) - Brazil. Most of the ICE courses from computer engineering programs around the world have put focus on teaching initial basic theoretical concepts of algorithms, logic, and digital systems. The ICE course at UFMS has been organized to encompass from initial basic concepts up to a practical and motivating set of experimental activities in order to clarify the program focus and to connect the concepts to practical applications. To evaluate the impacts of this new curriculum and methodology, an online anonymous survey has been carried out with students from 2011,2012, and 2013 classes. After a statistical analysis and validation of the answers, 28% of the students have pointed that the activities have been determinant to increase their motivation to study computer engineering. The impacts on students motivation, since the first semester, have been observed in the students evasion rate. The percentage of evasions in the computer engineering is less than other engineering programs at UFMS. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - We present a robotic platform based on the open source RepRap 3D printer that can print and maintain chemical artificial life in the form of a dynamic, chemical droplet. The robot uses computer vision, a self-organizing map, and a learning program to automatically categorize the behavior of the droplet that it creates. The robot can then use this categorization to autonomously detect the current state of the droplet and respond. The robot is programmed to visually track the droplet and either inject more chemical fuel to sustain a motile state or introduce a new chemical component that results in a state change (e.g., division). Coupling inexpensive open source hardware with sensing and feedback allows for replicable real-time manipulation and monitoring of nonequilibrium systems that would be otherwise tedious, expensive, and error-prone. This system is a first step towards the practical confluence of chemical, artificial intelligence, and robotic approaches to artificial life. © 2015 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

AB  - In this paper we discuss the motivation and challenges raised by the desire to consider the morphology as an experimental variable on real robotic platforms as well as allowing reproducibility and diffusion in the scientific community. In this context, we present an alternative design and production methodology that we have applied to the conception of Poppy, the first complete 3D printed open-source and open-hardware humanoid robot. Robust and accessible, it allows exploring quickly and easily the fabrication, the programming and the experimentation of various robotic morphologies. Both hardware and software are open-source, and a web platform allows interdisciplinary contributions, sharing and collaborations. Finally we conduct an experiment to explore the impact of four different foot morphologies on the robot's dynamic when it makes a footstep. We show that such experimentation can easily be achieved and shared in couple of days at almost no cost. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - This paper details the implementation of a low-cost, open hardware, cloud-based intelligent farm automation system. Physical parameters such as soil moisture, temperature and humidity are measured by employing sensors sited across the monitored area. The parametric data is transmitted to the Atmel ATmega328P microcontroller from the sensors using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The cloud performs real time intelligence operations based on periodic sensor inputs obtained from the farm and transmits control commands to the microcontroller. The novelty of the system lies in the use of BLE and in the intelligence provided by the cloud. The physically monitored, as well as virtually obtained parameters, at the cloud level allow intelligent command generation, facilitated by a data exchange system that leverages the existing telecom network prevalent in developing countries. Based on the cloud commands, the ATmega328P microcontroller controls the operation time period of the irrigation system thus conserving both water and energy. The approximate cost of implementing the proof of concept system elaborated in this paper by using off the shelf components at retail price is about USD 16. It is expected that the system cost will further reduce on mass production and commercialization. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents the design and implementation of an OpenRISC-based System-on-Chip (SoC), which is composed of hardware cores implementing the Digital Signal Processing (DSP) functions: Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter, Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filter and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The FIR-filter core is based on the transpose realization form, the IIR-filter core is based on the Second Order Sections (SOS) architecture and the FFT core is based on the Radix 22 Single Delay Feedback (R22SDF) architecture. The three cores are compatible with the Wishbone SoC bus, and they were described using generic and structural VHDL. In-system hardware verification was performed by using an OpenRisc-based SoC synthesized on an Altera FPGA. Tests showed that the designed DSP cores are suitable for building SoC based on the OpenRisc processor and the Wishbone bus. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - When the study on the relationship between the Head-of-Bed (HOB) angle and ventilator-associated pneumonia is performed, the fact that the HOB angle can only be measured intermittently imposes a significant limitation on the study. Therefore, there has been demand for the development of a device that can measure the HOB angle continuously. In this paper, we propose the rapid prototyping of an HOB measurement system using open-source hardware and software. The proposed system helps to maintain the HOB angle at a particular angle by displaying the angle and helps the medical study of pneumonia patients by enabling continuous data acquisition. Firstly, we eliminate the process of making an MCU board by utilizing an open-source hardware mbed LPC1768. Secondly, we reduce the software development time by using libraries and hence enabling the easy use of peripherals. Thirdly, for rapid prototyping, we build the enclosure of the proposed system using a 3D printer. The proposed system can be attached and detached to and from a bed. Therefore, we can attach it to the bed of a patient for whom measurement of the HOB angle is necessary. Finally, we check the measurement performance and the validity of the proposed system through an experiment utilizing an incremental encoder. © ICROS 2015.

AB  - This paper describes the adoption of an open source hardware release process for a wearable headlamp as a way to improve prototyping and promote regionally-appropriate technology. The headlamp has been developed to satisfy a communicated need for hands-free, directional lighting that can be charged with renewable energy technology in remote areas that lack reliable electricity. The design of the headlamp emphasizes the importance of built-in resilience as way to achieve durability. Utilizing a highly-adaptable mechanical design accompanied with guiding design principles enables the headlamp to be implemented in an unlimited number of locations; during manufacture, the product will be embedded with locally-appropriate features that complement the materials and skills available in the region. Releasing the product with an open source hardware license fosters product adaptation for the design, manufacture, and use of the headlamp in various locations. Working prototypes have been developed, and kits are available under the IEEE open-source hardware license. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Growers in arid regions of the world such as California are under increasing pressure to optimize water-use and reduce fertilizer loss. Wireless sensor and control networks can help growers manage their operations. A new system has been developed to reduce cost and improve flexibility for customization. It is based on an open-source hardware and software platform and uses modular parts to provide flexibility and reduced cost compared to other solutions. The system has been tested with early adopters and is being deployed in four California specialty crops for continued testing. A newly developed company plans to commercialize the system to promote more rapid adoption of precision agriculture among specialty crop farmers.

AB  - Principles of openness and collaboration that catalyze open-source software innovation have also been successfully transferred into the world of hardware [1]. Advances in open-source hardware allow students, researchers and hobbyists to custom build devices for a wide variety of purposes. Open-source prototyping platforms like Arduino and Raspberry Pi empower people to build cheap, modular, and easy to use alternatives to expensive commercial grade scientific equipment. The authors argue that the use of open-source hardware in building neuroIS research tools will dramatically decrease the costs and complexity associated with research in university laboratories. In this work, we discuss the use of open-source hardware in neuroIS research. We present the design of a neuroIS research tool based on BITalino, a biosignal capturing and processing platform. We also present a novel prototype that is specifically tuned toward neuroIS research using the API provided by the creators of BITalino. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - This paper presents the development of a low cost Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) which consists of open source hardware and has three thrusters. First, the hardware of the vehicle, including the actuators, sensors, and control structure, is described. Second, to study the relationship between the thrust forces and the performance of the ROV, a mathematical model of the vehicle in the form of a kinematic and kinetic model is established. Next, a hybrid control algorithm consisting of two components, namely model-based and PID algorithms, is proposed for surge speed, depth, and heading control. The effectiveness of the hybrid control algorithm is then verified by the ROV mathematical model-based simulations. Finally, free running tests for depth control are conducted to verify the robustness and reliability of the control structure and proposed algorithms. © 2014, Fuji Technology Press.

AB  - This study is to develop a device that enables to protect life of firefighters and facilitate firefighting activities. In many cases, the existing studies focus on the development of firefighting suites with many sensors and entire network system. In contrast, there are not many studies related to simple device easily used for protecting one’s life in fire firefighters is likely to encounter more frequently. As a result from the field research and focus group interview, it has been recognized that rapid concept prototype is possible to develop by using open source hardware. It has been also found that the device is required to combine with the existing equipment and it should be unit device with single function. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - Increasing design complexity, skyrocketing fabrication costs for modern digital systems coupled with an unacceptably large number of silicon respins led to growing importance of comprehensive and automated design verification. Akin to software configuration management, it is becoming commonplace to maintain large hardware design code-bases with hardware configuration management tools. A missing piece of crucial technology in this approach is to manage design verification across evolving hardware designs. In this paper, we propose an efficient methodology for automatically localizing design errors across design versions. The proposed technique, Evo Deb, can be easily integrated into a hardware configuration management framework and is scalable for large designs. We demonstrate the efficacy of Evo Deb on a couple of bugs on open-source hardware designs across multiple evolving variants. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - There has been some argument as to the legitimacy of the use of open-source technology (OST) in product design and manufacturing. Much of this has focused on intellectual property rights of the designer in the use of open-source software (OSS) and open-source hardware (OSH). Furthermore, in design education the question as to whether product design and industrial design students should learn to use open-source technology has been widely asked. This research addresses this question and considers commercial and non-commercial applications of open-source technology. The research methods comprised interviews and questionnaire survey with practicing designers and design students. The findings were analysed and discussed in relation to the growth in the application of open-source technology in commercial and educational settings. Copyright © 2015, IGI Global.

AB  - One of the problems faced by people living in cities is lack of time. Many people have gardens in their homes. Maintenance of these gardens is tedious and time consuming task. The main aim is to implement a cost effective automated gardening system. This system helps in solving the above problem by being efficient and using fewer resources. The system uses low cost efficient soil moisture, light and temperature sensors to decide when and how much water will be provided to the potted plants. Programming languages like embedded C and python is used to configure the microcontroller. The data would be displayed through a GUI created using processing. The user will also be able to control the entire system remotely as well as monitor the sensor readings. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Today, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is ubiquitous. It has touched almost all spheres concerning human survival, growth and development. Agriculture is no exception to it. This paper presents the research initiatives towards improving irrigation efficiency through affordable ICT solutions. It presents experimental results of studies related to improving irrigation efficiency in Semi arid zones in India, using commercially available ICT solutions. It compares between simple microirrigation and microirrigation with ICT (irrigation on demand) and establishes that by using ICT in agriculture, we can increase the irrigation efficiencies by a considerable amount. The paper also presents the development of indigenous wireless sensor node and gateway made from open source hardware and software components. The efforts in this regard show, while maintaining comparable performance, a significant reduction in the cost of wireless sensor devices, when compared to commercially available wireless sensor devices, is achieved. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - A multi-MHz bandwidth two-color interferometer to measure the integral electron density has been developed for the Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak-Upgrade (MAST-U). This paper describes the digitization and real time processing part of the system, which is based on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAS) using open source hardware from CERN. The phase shift is measured using heterodyne IQ-downconversion and CORDIC phase rotation enabling detection of integral electron density perturbations above 4MHz. The design is shown to be stable towards 2p-wraps beyond any rate of density change or mirror movement expected in a fusion device. Data is digitized, processed and streamed out in real time with less than 4ms delay making the diagnostic capable of being integrated into real-Time Tokamak protection systems and continuousshot experiments. © Copyright owned by the author(s) under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike Licence.

AB  - We developed a series of inexpensive but accurate mobile radiation detectors, which we named Pocket Geiger (POKEGA), to address the urgent desire of ordinary people to measure and share radiation levels in their milieus and to discuss the results of the Nuclear Disaster in Fukushima, Japan. This action research reports on a new style of pragmatic model of radiation monitoring, which employs the features of Participatory Design and Participatory Sensing and adopts modern communication platforms such as crowd-funding, open source development, and Facebook. This paper proposes an interaction model between the project management body, and other inclusive corroborators, e.g., ordinary users and experts, and focuses on three development phases of the project: start-up phase, evaluation phase, and operation phase. This paper also considers a reliability assurance model on disaster information sharing between the citizen layer and the official layer by data sharing and discussion activities in the POKEGA community.

AB  - In indoor environments, where density of people will be high such as offices, industries, colleges, banks, hospitals and others, if we want to locate a particular person or if some information has to be passed, it will be hard for us to search for that person. In a hospital if we want to locate the patients, wheelchairs, stretches and any other necessary equipment or in a ware house where you want to locate a carton, this RFID (Radio frequency identification) based system will be very useful and the information can be passed in time without much effort. The reader, which is located in specific locations, scans the tags which are in its range and using the unique identification number assigned to the tag. This tag information, along with reader address is passed to the receiver section using wireless communication. A database is maintained with all the received data such as tag ID, reader address and time stamps. The movement and position of these tags can be known through this system. A kiosk enables a user to place a query and get necessary data. © Research India Publications.

AB  - Nowadays, customized AT software solutions allow their users to interact with various kinds of computer systems. Such tools are generally available on personal devices (e.g., smartphones, laptops and so on) commonly used by a person with a disability. In this paper, we investigate a way of using the aforementioned AT equipments in order to access many different devices without assistive preferences. The solution takes advantage of open source hardware and its core component consists of an affordable Linux embedded system: it grabs data coming from the assistive software, which runs on the user's personal device, then, after processing, it generates native keyboard and mouse HID commands for the target computing device controlled by the end user. This process supports any operating system available on the target machine and it requires no specialized software installation; therefore the user with a disability can rely on a single assistive tool to control a wide range of computing platforms, including conventional computers and many kinds of mobile devices, which receive input commands through the USB HID protocol. © 2015 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - The protective relays in the Taipower Extra High Voltage (EHV) substations have different brand models because they were procured during different time periods. There are differential current protective relays and directional distance protective relays from SEL, differential current protective relays from GE, and protective relays from Toshiba. The different relays each have different settings and maintenance modes, including those with the RS232 and RS485 serial ports and ASCII text command mode maintenance operations, those using the factory GUI utility to connect to the remote relay, to login, and to change the flag settings, those that use MODBUS protocol to communicate with remote intelligent devices, and those that exchange information with other substations using DNP3 protocol. A small portion of the old SEL devices include an FTP protocol mode to download flag situations. As learned from actual operating experience, as all protective relay flags are manually modified, it is impossible to judge whether they were modified properly until the time trip results are available when an accident occurs. Therefore, if the electrical protective relays at a substation were to be altered by unauthorized persons, supervisors have no method of detection. Thus, this paper proposes an open source hardware and software architecture with regular data inquiries, storage, and comparisons to determine whether online relay settings have been altered. © 2015 Taylor and Francis Group, London.

AB  - Spatial haptic interfaces have been around for 20 years. Yet, few affordable devices have been produced, and the design space in terms of physical workspace and haptic fidelity of devices that have been produced are limited and discrete. In this paper, an open-source, open-hardware module-based kit is presented that allows an interaction designer with little electro-mechanical experience to manufacture and assemble a fully working spatial haptic interface. It also allows for modification in shape and size as well as tuning of parameters to fit a particular task or application. Results from an evaluation showed that the haptic quality of the WoodenHaptics device was on par with a Phantom Desktop and that a novice could assemble it with guidance in a normal office space. This open source starting kit, uploaded free-to-download online, affords sketching in hardware; it "unsticks" the hardware from being a highly-specialized and esoteric craft to being an accessible and user-friendly technology, while maintaining the feel of high-fidelity haptics.

AB  - A very serious problem has been identified for past many years that paralyzed human beings became isolated from the society for not having a proper existence and due to their reluctances of doing normal life works. Therefore, we have researched on the Human Machine Interaction using Physical Human Body Gestures and came up to proposed solution of the said issue as Low Cost Retina Controlled Computer Using Head mount and Wrist Tilt for Persons who are Paralyzed and cannot be able to move their hands and even they can't able to walk. Conventionally, we named it as simple as Retina Controlled Computer, is based on Google Glass vision using motion recognition, Zigbee Wireless Technology, Retina Controlled Device that allows human beings with paralysis resulting from Paralysis to do everything on computer even controlling the personal mobile phone using only their Eye and Head movements. This whole project will be based mainly on the new technology of Low Cost Wireless Zigbee Sensors, Arduino Microcontrollers, and motion and retina recognition using Accelerometer. Arduino Microcontroller consists of an open-source hardware board designed around an 8-bit Atmel AVR microcontroller, or a 32-bit Atmel ARM. Therefore, making an Intelligent Low Cost Eye Controlled Computer, based on new technologies will play a vital role in revolutionizing the field of Biomedical engineering and opening the new horizons of research. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Attitude control systems are a huge enabling technology for amatuer and university class high-powered rockets to be more useful as testbeds for high-altitude science, but they are presently too costly and technically complex to implement for many groups. With the intention of making this technology more accessible to the high-powered rocketry field a mechanical engineering senior capstone team at Portland State University developed an open-source, scalable attitude control system leveraging COTS components and additive manufacturing. A qualitative narrative describing the system design logic is presented here. © 2015, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - The RepRap 3D printer development project is a fast growing, open-hardware initiative relying on the input of hobbyist designers. One of its key components is the printer nozzle. The performance and reliability deficiencies of currently available nozzle designs are common topics in the RepRap community, and our own experience with a RepRap 3D printer has identified a need for improvement in a few particular areas. We set out to eliminate melt leakage, improve thermal isolation, and develop a more effective method of nozzle assembly attachment. Here, we review the issues, describe design efforts, and report results. © 2014 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - Wired Audio Networking is an established practice since years, based on both proprietary solutions or open hardware and protocols. One of the most cost-effective solutions is the use of a general purpose IEEE 802.3 infrastructure and personal computers running IP based protocols. One obvious shortcoming of such setup is the lack of synchronization at the audio level and the presence of a network delay affected by jitter. Two approaches to sustain a continuous audio flow are described, implemented by the authors in open source projects based on a relative and absolute time adaptive resampling. A description of the mechanisms is provided along with simulated and measured results, which show the validity of both approaches.

AB  - This paper presents an intelligent multisensor framework based on the BeableBone Black platform, a complete open hardware and software embedded computer; the challenge is to create a multi-purpose hierarchical network composed by smart nodes able to gain and manage heterogeneous data and spaces according to the Internet of Things paradigm. Thanks to several expansion modules, the designed nodes can become an instrument for monitoring, preservation and protection of several environments. As a proof of the proposed framework we conducted a first prototypal experimentation within the Cultural Heritage domain; in detail we deployed the system in an art exhibition within the Maschio Angioino Castle, Naples, Italy. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.

AB  - Timing is critical when trying to engage students in various engineering career paths. While many 'National Engineers Week' programs exist for primary and middle school students, there is a lack of hands on activities for students in the 9th-12th grades. It is often difficult to devise experiments for this age group that are interesting and not juvenile. Yet, it is during these crucial years that most students are lost to science, math and engineering. Engaging students and presenting opportunities for invention and excitement is important in the teen years, when peer pressure and the distractions of friends, social events, and activities are particularly high.1. There are a number of open source programming and affordable hardware platforms that can be used to implement low cost and interactive programs to promote innovation with various age groups. In this paper we share our work, as well as our learnings on how to make the workshops more effective. We have created various Arduino projects that can be customized to grade levels ranging from grades 7-12, and even college undergraduate students. The various projects we describe in this paper have been used to interact with students of different grade levels to engage in basic elements of engineering and computer programming. The classes should be set up to work in groups to promote shared innovation, teamwork and collaboration with peers. The open source and hardware experimenting exposed the students to various career paths ranging from software engineer, to electronic engineers and basic elements of various other engineering paths. This paper is designed to demonstrate the promotion of the engineering profession in schools through the use of Arduino Uno, Raspberry Pi Gemma kits, and Flora kits. The programs are also designed to accommodate classroom setting, workshops, or as an in-class field trip. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - The Open Compute Project. OCP (http://www.opencompute.org/). was launched by Facebook in 2011 with the objective of building efficient computing infrastructures at the lowest possible cost. The technologies are released as open hardware. with the goal to develop servers and data centres following the model traditionally associated with open source software projects. In 2013 CERN acquired a few OCP servers in order to compare performance and power consumption with standard hardware. The conclusions were that there are sufficient savings to motivate an attempt to procure a large scale installation. One objective is to evaluate if the OCP market is sufficiently mature and broad enough to meet the constraints of a public procurement. This paper summarizes this procurement. which started in September 2014 and involved the Request for information (RFI) to qualify bidders and Request for Tender (RFT).

AB  - The secure boot-up and setup of Internet of Things (IoT) devices connected over the Cloud represent a challenging open issue. This paper deals with the automatic configuration of IoT devices in a secure way through the Cloud, in order to provide new addedvalue services. After a discussion on the limits of current IoT and Cloud solutions in terms of secure self-configuration, we present a Cloud-based architecture that allows IoT devices to interact with several federated Cloud providers. In particular, we present two possible scenarios, that is, single Cloud and a federated Cloud environments, interacting with IoT devices and we address specific issues of both. Moreover, we present several design highlights on how to operate considering real open hardware and software products already available in the market. © 2015 Antonio Puliafito et al.

AB  - What does open source mean for culture? For knowledge? As cultural production has come to be characterized by contribution as well as consumption and as alternative modes of intellectual property transfer challenge the ‘dominant paradigm’ that knowledge and information should be protected and monetized, the logic of ‘open sourcing’ has extended into many cultural spheres. This article positions ‘openness’ as a value that intermediates between re-usable software code, institutional transparency, and expanded opportunities for participation in knowledge production cultures. By observing and analyzing the expansion of ‘openness’ from computer software to electronics hardware, we can develop a framework that identifies the tensions between socio-cultural visions of knowledge commons and the realities of governing those commons. This research focuses in particular on the knowledge related to electronics hardware and other material objects governed by open hardware licenses. The insights in this article are valuable for anyone studying open source and peer production processes and the knowledge claims surrounding them. © The Author(s) 2015.

AB  - In recent years the number of automobiles have been increased on the roads. Due to high density of vehicles, the potential threats and road accidents are increasing. Alongside new application domains are evolving such as infotainment. VANETs is an emerging technology where the information is exchanged among the vehicles on the road to provide updates about different road situations and dangerous conditions, to save time and lives. A lot of research is carried in this field and many simulations studies are available. The experimental studies based on the open sources hardware models are very rare. We have developed a prototype for VANETs to exchange short safety messages and infotainment sharing among the vehicles. Along with designing we have also analyzed its performance and obtained results by doing many experiments using Arduino. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - This paper suggests that Mass-Individualization, which is based on a consumer product that consists of an open hardware platform and multiple modules that are interfaced with the platform, will constitute the next paradigm in product design. Customers will be able to adapt the open platform to their needs by integrating modules of their choice into the platform, thereby constructing individual products that fit their exact needs. Large manufacturers will produce the platforms, and small companies will invent and produce modules that could be interfaced with the open-platform products. Smartphones is an example of an open-platform product, and the Apps that are designed to run on smartphones are examples for modules. Each customer downloads certain Apps that fit his/her needs, thereby creating an individual smartphone. The Apps, however, are software modules. The modules that are considered in this paper are hardware modules. Open-platform products will create a new paradigm in product design and utilization that we call the Mass-Individualization paradigm. The Mass-Individualization paradigm will boost the economy by (1) creating many new jobs in module production companies and (2) increasing the level of sales of consumer products. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are well suited for both research and teaching. In this paper the architecture for the design of CPS controllers based on free hardware and software is presented. The advantages of this system include its flexibility, its modular structure facilitating concurrent development and its robustness, with easy evolution of existing systems. An application case study that highlights the potential of this model is detailed. Low cost modules have been chosen. As they are largely utilized they have a large community of developers and plenty related technical information can be found. They are based on free hardware and operating systems widely available. Modularity allows implementing them on existing systems, allowing easy evolution. Another significant advantage of the proposed model for both research and teaching is that, due to its low cost, it allows building more mobile robots. © 2015 AISTI.

AB  - There is no doubt that computer architecture represents a core course in computer science curriculum. A computer architecture course involves mainly the microprocessor structure and operation which constitutes the heart of the whole system. Due to microprocessor complexity, a number of simulation software solutions have been developed for supporting the corresponding courses. On the other hand, simulators offer only a visual environment where the students cannot change operational or structural characteristics for studying the corresponding microprocessor behavior. Moreover, and much more important is the fact that students cannot demystify the physical level where bit manipulation takes place. A novel and low cost approach for studying in depth microprocessor structure and operation at programming and hardware level is presented and finally proposed for the very first time in this paper. The student uses programmable hardware modules for developing the internal structure of a microprocessor. Finally, the developed microprocessor can be studied from programmer’s or developer’s view. © 2015 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to present TalkBox, an affordable and open-source communication board for users with communication or speech disorders. Making and tinkering methods are combined with community engagement and participatory design to create a democratic and accessible approach to assistive technology design. Design/methodology/approach – The authors employed a community-engaged participatory design methodology where we incorporated input from stakeholders into the design of the interface. Close collaboration with our community partner allowed us to make informed decisions on different aspects of the design from sourcing of the material to testing the prototype. Findings – Through describing TalkBox, the paper presents a concrete example of how assistive technology can be designed and deployed more democratically, how collaborations between academia and community partners can be established, and how the design reflects different aspects of the methodology used. Originality/value – This paper explores the question of how can open-source technology and making methods contribute to the development of more affordable and inclusive designs through a concrete example. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Clock and/or frequency synchronization is a common requirement in modern distributed measurement and control systems, such as Internet of Things (IoT). The required precision is application dependent; however, the possibility of sub 1 microsecond precision provided by low-cost advanced IEEE 1588 implementations sets the industry standard today. The performance and price of IEEE 1588 implementations are primarily defined by the master clocks and their actual installation and configuration. The paper investigate how master clock architectures, i.e., how the master clock is connected to the reference clock, influence price and performance; and in addition, it also details how the architecture effects installation and configuration requirements. The primary factors of investigation are ambient temperature and delay compensation required due to signal transmission time. The paper also introduces the architecture and performance of a Linux based open source/hardware prototype master clock developed by the author. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to articulate the need for an open, extensible robot platform to support swarm robotic research using vision and to propose one such platform. The platform proposed here is intended for research which trades smaller population size with more sophisticated individual robot capabilities. The validation of proposed swarm robotic algorithms using real-world hardware is essential, but is fraught with difficulty due to the expense and complexity of developing and maintaining multiple operational units. A number of open hardware platforms have been pro- posed, although most prioritize small size and low cost over advanced capabilities such as vision. We are interested in a number of different research directions which utilize vision as a core capability and find the existing open hardware plat- forms to be insufficient (and existing commercial platforms too expensive). In this paper we describe a set of desirable characteristics for an open, extensible visually-guided robot platform. We then present our solution, the BuPiGo (pronounced buppy-go), describing the hardware itself and a model developed for simulation purposes. We also present some initial results on using the BuPiGo for visual homing| an individual navigation task that we hope to exploit for swarm tasks in the future. Copyright © 2016 ICST.

AB  - The aim of this work is the development of a network of wireless devices to determine, along with a time-stamp, postural changes of users that are to be used in personalized learning environments. For this purpose, we have designed a basic low-cost pressure sensor that can be built from components easily available. Several of these basic sensors (of sizes and shapes chosen specifically for the task) are integrated into a posture sensor cushion, which is electronically controlled by an Arduino microcontroller board. This accounts for experiments involving either a single cushion to be used by an individual end-user setting approach or classroom approaches where several of these cushions make up a sensor network via ZigBee wireless connections. The system thus formed is an excellent alternative to other more expensive commercial systems and provides a low-cost, easy-to-use, portable, scalable, autonomous, flexible solution with free hardware and software, which can be integrated with other sensing devices into a larger affect detection system, customizable to cope with postural changes at required time intervals and support single and collective oriented experimentation approaches. © 2015 Ricardo Barba et al.

AB  - Phenotyping has become the rate-limiting step in using large-scale genomic data to understand and improve agricultural crops. Here, the Bellwether Phenotyping Platform for controlled-environment plant growth and automated multimodal phenotyping is described. The system has capacity for 1140 plants, which pass daily through stations to record fluorescence, near-infrared, and visible images. Plant Computer Vision (PlantCV) was developed as open-source, hardware platform-independent software for quantitative image analysis. In a 4-week experiment, wild Setaria viridis and domesticated Setaria italica had fundamentally different temporal responses to water availability. While both lines produced similar levels of biomass under limited water conditions, Setaria viridis maintained the same water-use efficiency under water replete conditions, while Setaria italica shifted to less efficient growth. Overall, the Bellwether Phenotyping Platform and PlantCV software detected significant effects of genotype and environment on height, biomass, water-use efficiency, color, plant architecture, and tissue water status traits. All ∼79 000 images acquired during the course of the experiment are publicly available. © 2015 The Author.

AB  - In this article, we examine the challenges of developing intelligent wireless geosystems and the pros and cons of interdisciplinary research. First, we summarize the range of current practices in wireless sensor network research projects by analyzing recent contributions in the literature. Specifically, for each wireless sensor network project, we compile details regarding the scope (e.g., simulation, testbed, real deployment), the type of mote used (e.g., TinyOS, Android, Arduino), and the type of sensors used (e.g., inertial, biological). Next, we discuss reasons why Arduino based wireless devices are perhaps the future of applied wireless sensor network research. Arduino-based systems are inexpensive, easy to use, readily available, well documented, 100% open-source (hardware and software), object oriented, extendable (using the 'shield' concept), and flexible (e.g., in terms of radio choices). Lastly, we discuss the pros and cons of interdisciplinary research; that is, we highlight the struggle between working on difficult, relevant, inherently multi-disciplinary research problems while maintaining scholarship in individual fields. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Vascular stiffness is an indicator of cardiovascular health, with carotid artery stiffness having established correlation to coronary heart disease and utility in cardiovascular diagnosis and screening. State of art equipment for stiffness evaluation are expensive, require expertise to operate and not amenable for field deployment. In this context, we developed ARTerial Stiffness Evaluation for Noninvasive Screening (ARTSENS), a device for image free, noninvasive, automated evaluation of vascular stiffness amenable for field use. ARTSENS has a frugal hardware design, utilizing a single ultrasound transducer to interrogate the carotid artery, integrated with robust algorithms that extract arterial dimensions and compute clinically accepted measures of arterial stiffness. The ability of ARTSENS to measure vascular stiffness in vivo was validated by performing measurements on 125 subjects. The accuracy of results was verified with the state-of-the-art ultrasound imaging-based echo-tracking system. The relation between arterial stiffness measurements performed in sitting posture for ARTSENS measurement and sitting/supine postures for imaging system was also investigated to examine feasibility of performing ARTSENS measurements in the sitting posture for field deployment. This paper verified the feasibility of the novel ARTSENS device in performing accurate in vivo measurements of arterial stiffness. As a portable device that performs automated measurement of carotid artery stiffness with minimal operator input, ARTSENS has strong potential for use in large-scale screening. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a new and cost-effective rapid control prototyping (RCP) system based on the Arduino Due and Matlab/Simulink. The proposed RCP system has a feature that a computer on which Simulink is running acts as a realtime controller and the Arduino Due performs data acquisition, transmission of the data to and from a computer through a built-in high speed USB interface, and the application of control data received from Simulink. For its implementation, we develop 7 input and output blocks for use with Simulink, all of which are implemented from a single S-function. We also propose a method through which we can overcome the problem arising when the sampling time of the control system is not constant. The proposed RCP system has several advantages over existing methods such as good maintainability, portability due to the USB interface, low cost, and no necessity for C-code generation even though it can only be applied to control systems with moderate sampling rates. It is expected that the proposed RCP system can be useful in teaching control-related topics to undergraduate and graduate students. © Avestia Publishing, 2015.

AB  - Summary An embedded model predictive controller (eMPC) based on the linear MPC module in Statoil Estimation and Prediction Tool for Identification and Control has been developed, and it is intended to facilitate the MPC application on embedded hardware. The control design approach illustrates a viable way of migrating from an industrial PC-based MPC technology to an embedded platform. This work also provides the transformations and the real-time considerations necessary to achieve a functional high-performance predictive controller on a low-cost embedded hardware, with limited computational resources. The eMPC was implemented for rapid prototyping on the Ethernut 5 open-source hardware, and its performance was tested for a simulated process. The concept was tested using a real MPC application developed for a prototype of a new industrial process that requires an advanced embedded multivariable, constraint handling control solution. The results confirm the viability of the embedded MPC design approach. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - There are many disaster happened around the world. In addition there are unknown space or environment require human seek out it. Especially when disaster could move space for different between in before and after. People don’t know any information can assist them make a right policy decision. Also human’s perceptions don’t very sensitivity, such as optical illusion. The nose can’t smell and identify harmful gases, or ear can’t identify source of sound. People are need sensors and algorithms to assist them in that scenario. This research presents a method an easily design prototype robot. And robot equipped multiplex sensor used open source hardware. This robot has variety functions. Those functions come from design idea and application. This robot has equipped compass sensor aka M-sensor. The robot equipped Accelerometer, aka M-sensor.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to present the new, innovative teaching approach and tinkering pedagogy towards developing the students skills in STEM domains (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) with aim to the designing the laboratory for radiation detector development. Involving from one side concept of social situatedness and connectedness, and from another the concept of independent, self-directed and self-regulated student learning, the project was based on assembling the mini-lab, Radiation Sensor Board for Arduino, that was originally designed to help people in Japan to measure levels of radiation in their everyday life after the Fukushima accident. As it was reported elsewhere, this product was an example of crowdsourcing. When Libelien designed the Radiation Sensor Board for Waspmote, the idea was simple: with the Arduino platform people will be able to have easily running their own detector at home while on the other hand with Waspmote platform authorities will be able to deploy autonomous sensor networks to send the radiation levels from dangerous areas using wireless sensor platform ZigBee and GPRS technologies. This paper present students developing project where the Sensor Board for Arduino was used as assembling, teaching tool. The Do-It-Yourself and Internet of Things can be used both in educational, and in the research and development purposes. Owning their own mini-lab at their disposal anytime, students worked at their learning speed. It also boosted the interest, confidence of students and highly affected three domains of learning: cognitive domain (activities like instrumentation, modeling, experimentation, data analysis and design, psychomotor domain (activities like manipulating the apparatus, sensory awareness) and affective domain (behavior and attitudes to learn from failure, creativity, collaborative communication, safety and ethics in the laboratory). We show that networking learning, supported by hands-on labs on chip, and an open source electronics prototyping platform as Arduino and Raspberry Pi, give great opportunities for teaching and learning the tinkering and inventing skills, an request we have to deal with it at the University of Montenegro. Such project support exploratory and serendipitous learning. It moved teching from an emphasis simply on linear logic and programmed instruction, towards non-linear, networked, branching, hypertext views of learning, in which connections between knowledge are made and developed. It is based on principle of situated cognition and Vigotskian thought: situatedness, commonality, interdependency and infrastructure where learning is fascinated by an activity. The presented project integrate a Virtual Learning Environment, networking knowledge and student-owned movable laboratory on the chip, where radiation was used as a topic and where electronics was embedded and embodied. © 2015 RAD Conference Proceedings.

AB  - Arduino is a free, opensource hardware platform that can be reprogrammed with a piece of opensource software. Software that reprograms hardware allows people to transform the way they understand and interact with the world because electronics are omnipresent in our everyday activities. Elevators run with microcontrollers, in an average car there are seventy microcontrollers and even a microwave oven has microcontrollers. The goal of Arduino is to empower people other than engineers to understand interaction paradigms such as physical, tangible and ubiquitous computing and to create their own interactive artifacts with digital electronics. Eventually, it democratizes learning by practical experimentation so that learners discover how to be independent, how to use things by themselves, how to exploit those things to build interactive systems by themselves and how to be critically demanding about technology. In this talk, I will introduce the feature that makes a free hardware platform such as Arduino a powerful learning tool that foster creativity and I will talk about a vision for the computing education for the 21st century: accessible and pleasant approaches to teach kids how to reprogram the surrounding environment. To this end, I will share experiences and insights gathered from project-based learning experiments with Arduino in secondary schools.. © 2015, Springer Verlag, All Rights Reserved

AB  - ExpertEyes is a low-cost, open-source package of hardware and software that is designed to provide portable high-definition eyetracking. The project involves several technological innovations, including portability, high-definition video recording, and multiplatform software support. It was designed for challenging recording environments, and all processing is done offline to allow for optimization of parameter estimation. The pupil and corneal reflection are estimated using a novel forward eye model that simultaneously fits both the pupil and the corneal reflection with full ellipses, addressing a common situation in which the corneal reflection sits at the edge of the pupil and therefore breaks the contour of the ellipse. The accuracy and precision of the system are comparable to or better than what is available in commercial eyetracking systems, with a typical accuracy of less than 0.4° and best accuracy below 0.3°, and with a typical precision (SD method) around 0.3° and best precision below 0.2°. Part of the success of the system comes from a high-resolution eye image. The high image quality results from uncasing common digital camcorders and recording directly to SD cards, which avoids the limitations of the analog NTSC format. The software is freely downloadable, and complete hardware plans are available, along with sources for custom parts. © 2014, Psychonomic Society, Inc.

AB  - Our paper describes a challenging and enjoyable undergraduate student project that details the process of configuring a Raspberry Pi into an advanced multimedia player as a headless system controllable by infrared remote or secure shell (SSH) protocol. This paper provides a methodological, step-by-step set of specific instructions on how to replicate this project. The undergraduate student applied concepts from operating systems (OS), networks, and electronics into practical steps to exploit readily available open-source software packages and highly-customizable hardware components. Electronic components were soldered to build a modified printed circuit board (PCB) with a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen and push-buttons, and were successfully combined with an external sound card, wireless universal serial bus (USB) card, and an infrared (IR) receiver into a fully assembled, affordable, and reliable device. This developed device can be controlled using any IR-capable remote, is capable of playing high-quality audio, and circumvents advertisements on the free audio streaming web service Pandora Radio using a pre-existing free or paid account. Using this device improves the user's experience of Pandora Radio in several ways while keeping this device portable and preserving all functionality of the Raspberry Pi itself. The goal of this project is to use available tools and integrate various technological fields into a deliverable consumer product. Consumer electronics continue to place increasing emphasis on supporting open-source hardware and software, and the Raspberry Pi provides an affordable, flexible, multi-purpose platform for both beginners and experts to personalize into a wide range of useful and specialized products. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2015.

AB  - Despite the rapid change in cellular technologies, Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) keep a high percentage of their deployed infrastructure using Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) technologies. With about 3.5 billion subscribers, GSM remains as the de facto standard for cellular communications. However, the security criteria envisioned 30 years ago, when the standard was designed, are no longer sufficient to ensure the security and privacy of the users. Furthermore, even with the newest fourth generation (4G) cellular technologies starting to be deployed, these networks could never achieve strong security guarantees because the MNOs keep backwards- compatibility given the huge amount of GSM subscribers. In this paper, we present and describe the tools and necessary steps to perform an active attack against a GSM-compatible network, by exploiting the GSM protocol lack of mutual authentication between the subscribers and the network. The attack consists of a so-called man-in-the- middle attack implementation. By using Software Defined Radio (SDR), open-source libraries and open- source hardware, we setup a fake GSM base station to impersonate the network and therefore eavesdrop any communications that are being routed through it and extract information from their victims. Finally, we point out some implications of the protocol vulnerabilities and how these can not be mitigated in the short term since 4G deployments will take long time to entirely replace the current GSM infrastructure. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - The AMC FMC Carrier Kintex (AFCK) board is a prototype of Data Processing Board (DPB) for CBM experiment. AFCK is open hardware and was designed to be a versatile solution, applicable in multiple systems. In CBM experiment AFCK will serve as a data hub and communication interconnection. One of DPB's functions is synchronization of Front End Electronics (FEE). To provide this functionality, it is necessary to receive the reference clock and timing signals from the Timing and Flow Control system. The received clock after the jitter cleaning will be used as a reference clock for GBT-FPGA based 4.8 Gbps links used for communication with front end electronics. This article will briefly describe AFCK board function in CBM experiment. Afterwards it will focus on jitter cleaning technique based on White Rabbit solution that can be used on AFCK board. © 2015 SPIE.

AB  - This work presents the design of an open-source control architecture specifically tailored to the rapid development and testing of control and coordination algorithms on micro quadrotors. The proposed design extends an existing open-source and open-hardware quadrotor project, i.e., the Crazyflie nano quadrotor, by adding the guidance, navigation and control layers required to accomplish autonomous flight. The control layer, in particular, is based on a cascade control algorithm able to globally stabilize the position and the attitude of the vehicle. The global property guaranteed by the algorithm allows the quadrotors to perform aggressive maneuvers. The guidance layer is designed to coordinate simultaneously multiple vehicles by generating suitable reference trajectories. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - The great usefulness of remote recording of biomedical signals in most aspects of daily life has generated an increasing interest in this field. Traditionally, monitoring devices from clinical enviroments are bulky, intrusive, and expensive. Thus, the development of wearable, mobile, and low-cost applications is desirable. Nevertheless, recent improvements in open-hardware allow developing low cost devices and portable designs for biosignal monitoring in out-of-lab applications, such as sports, leisure, e-Health, etc. This paper presents a low-cost wearable system able to simultaneously record electrical brain and heart activity (i.e. electroencephalography and electrocardiography). The system is able to send biomedical data to a platform for remote analyses. Both software and hardware are open-source. We assessed the system for its validity and reliability in a real road environment. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - Determination of moisture content of soil is absolutely crucial and must be performed frequently to assure the quality of construction work. In a view to suppress the limitations and inaccuracies of the existing methods, a new concept is successfully implemented. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and state-of-the-art electronic circuitry are embedded to realize an automatic measurement system based on an open-source computing platform. Moreover, to facilitate user interaction with the system, a sophisticated graphical user interface (GUI) is created. This system, from both the hardware and software perspective, brings new ideas in, not only the moisture content determination test, but in geotechnical engineering laboratory and field instrumentation in terms of accuracy, automation, and machine intelligence. It will be obvious from this work that open-source hardware and software embedded in test equipment can automate the whole test procedure for almost all types of tests in geotechnical engineering using appropriate sensor, and data-acquisition and processing routines. This paper presents the technical know-how of the system setup, hardware, and software development, workflow, and system validation for the determination of moisture content of subgrade soil in two distinct test modes - supervised and unsupervised. This work will demonstrate that, not only the test procedure can be automated, but time optimization is also possible, which results in at least 50% test time reduction.

AB  - The aim of the paper is to define a remit of interest for design and designers in the field of products and services employing human face as an interface with users. From the point of view of design culture, humanoid artifacts, are at the intersection of product design, visual communication, and interaction design. The release of open hardware platforms, such as Arduino Robot, as well as the diffusion of fabrication laboratories (fablabs) and open design practices are the early manifestations of a wider interest toward social robotics accompanied by the possibility of building working prototypes of humanoid artifacts. The use of human face as interface in human–computer interaction adds analogic content to interaction processes in an unmediated and unobtrusive way, transferring human-computer interaction to the field of interpersonal communication. Nevertheless, the field of anthropomorphic artifacts is generally neglected by designers and rather controlled by engineers and experimental psychologists. Starting from a definition and taxonomy of humanoid artifacts, the aim of this chapter is to describe the paradigm of human-computer interaction through case studies of humanoid artifacts and to define criteria for the evaluation of humanoid artifacts from the perspective of design practice. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - In this paper a system is proposed to retrofit a two axes Computer Numeric Control machine with open software and hardware architecture. The main objective of the paper is to analyses the performance of an open controller and the corresponding hardware. The overall control is done by open software developed in Linux. The machine operation is tested by sending a sample data written in G-code to a two axis CNC lathe, retrofitted with open hardware and interfacing to LinuxCNC operating system. The machine input commands issued by the LinuxCNC are interpreted by the motion control card and trajectory control signals are generated.These signals are converted to motor drive pulses by an FPGA module. The I/O signal generated by the FPGA module is fed to the AC servo motors using servo drives. The motion control card communicates with the LinuxCNC based personal computer using PCIExpress bus. That will assist the machine tool designers to develop a more flexible and versatile open system and help the end users to reconfigure and restructure the system as per their own requirement at lower cost. © Research India Publications.

AB  - This paper introduces Open Mote, the latest generation of Berkeley motes. OpenMote is a open-hardware prototyping ecosystem designed to accelerate the development of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). It features the OpenMote-CC2538, a state-of-the-art computing and communication device. This device interfaces with several other accessories, or “skins”, through a standardized connector. The skins developed to date include boards to provide power, boards which enable a developer to easily debug the platform, and boards to allow seamless integration of an Open Mote network into the Internet. This hardware ecosystem is complemented by a suite of software tools and ports to popular open-source IoT implementations. The Open Mote platform is for example tailored to run the Open WSN open-source implementation of emerging IIoT standards. The combination of hardware and software ecosystems gives an embedded programmer an intuitive and complete development environment, and an end-user a fully working low-power wireless mesh networking solution running the latest IIoT standards. © Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2015.

AB  - The OpenOrbiter Small Spacecraft Development Initiative is working to create a set of designs and implementation instructions for a 1-U CubeSat, called the Open Prototype for Educational NanoSats. These designs target a total parts cost of below USD $5,000. This design will be made publically available to facilitate its use by others, with or without modification. A ‘side slotted’ CubeSat design (where main circuit boards are placed in slots between the rails on the outside) has been developed for OpenOrbiter. This paper discusses the design choices that were made during the mechanical structure development of the OpenOrbiter CubeSat design, required to keep it within the mass, volume and monetary budgets. Choices like the design of the aluminum support structure, fastener mechanisms, circuit board layout and science package support structure are all discussed and their ease of construction and efficacy are considered. A discussion of ongoing work on the spacecraft’s mechanical fabrication and other subsystems is also presented. The paper also discusses how the design can, prospectively, be utilized by others and the ‘bigger picture’ benefits provided by the design approach and open hardware concept. © 2015 by Benjamin Kading, Jeremy Straub and Ronald Marsh.

AB  - Laboratory practices are very important activities in BSc (Bachelor of Science) and MSc (Master of Science) engineering courses involving concepts of Measurement Science, because they give to both undergraduate and graduate students the unique opportunity to verify with hands-on experiences the arguments introduced in theoretical lessons. Today there are truly uncountable different possible hardware/software low cost choices available for University teaching which could be complementary or alternative to the commonly used teaching tools (LabVIEW®, MATLAB®, etc.). In effects, the use of open-source and open-hardware platforms can offer different advantages with respect to traditional ones; first, they assure a bottom-up approach, which guarantees a pleasant and constructive learning with a gradual comprehension of concepts from the simple ones to more complex ones. Then, these cheap and readily available platforms permit to verify (also at home) the theoretical concepts and the proposed exercises with low cost devices rather than with expensive ones. Finally, the learning outcomes of the basic courses are indispensable to advanced courses where sensors, wireless networking and embedded systems converge, encouraging students to explore and realize new applications, preparing them for successful careers as engineers. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - The lack of accessible quality healthcare is one of the biggest problems in Africa and other developing countries. This is not only due to the unavailability of resources, but also to the absence of a structured formative process for the design and management of healthcare facilities. Crucial to the effective and efficient exploitation of healthcare facilities and biomedical technology is the support of Biomedical engineers, who form the link between technology and medical practice. Indeed Biomedical engineers, together with nurses and doctors, form the pillars of healthcare systems in the developed world. In this paper, the Open Source for BioMedical Engineering (OS4BME) project and its kick off summer school are presented. The OS4BME project aims at developing a new generation of biomedical engineers, able to exploit emerging technologies generated by the recent "Makers" revolution. During the one week summer school, students from various sub-Saharan countries were introduced to these new design, development and sharing paradigms. Students worked together to identify new simple biomedical devices, which could help in daily clinical practice in their countries. A cheap and easy-to-use neonatal monitoring device was chosen as a Crowd design project. The OS4BME Baby Monitor was designed and assembled by the students during the one week summer school, demonstrating the creative potential of the new generation of biomedical engineers empowered with the paradigms of crowdsourcing and rapid prototyping. © 2015 by authors.

AB  - More than 50 billion devices are estimated to be connected to the Internet by 2020. Incompatibility of devices and protocols (usually proprietary devices and protocols) are one of the major hurdles to be overcome to realise the Internet of Things (IoT) vision. IoT devices are typically constrained devices and this creates dependencies between the hardware, software and protocols used in the device. Open hardware and software platforms to support emerging IoT trends are required. A wireless sensor network gateway was developed in a three-month period using off-the-shelf components. The gateway was based on the Raspberry PI single-board computer; it implemented 6LoWPAN mesh and wireless access point functionality for mobile and low power sensing and actuation devices. The gateway was tested in the following use-case: integrate a battery-operated 6LoWPAN-enabled smart water meter to an IPv6 building network. Several factors that influence the gateway's performance and reliability were identified and should be considered when deploying gateway devices for future endeavours. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Current state of the art’s real time monitoring of fresh produce, provides only temperature and humidity information [1–3]. The idea is to develop new sensors and transport service assisted by ICT platform to monitor fresh produce quality. The technology will be based on radio frequency (RF) wireless network, and will provide real-time and in-site data-logging, enabling active management of food products in storage and transit. The RF sensor network design, allows an auxiliary sensor node to be “plugged in”. In this contribution we present the commercial platform developed starting from o fork of open hardware on which we assemble an array of commercial sensors in an “open air” configuration. We developed for this Embedded Gas Sensor System Device (Tinynose) two set-up: the “Development set-up” that uses a star wireless network infrastructure to store all raw sensor output and associated measurement error in a server DB to define parameters in ripening mathematical model and the “TAG set-up” that performs ripening evaluation in ICT in-site platform. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - The prime objective of any technological innovation is to improve the life of people. Technological innovation in the field of medical devices directly touches the lives of millions of people; not just patients but doctors and other technicians as well. Serving these care givers is serving humanity. Growth of Mobil Devices and Cloud Computing has changed the way we live and work. We try to bring the benefits of these technological innovations to the medical field via equipment which can improve the working efficiencies and capabilities of the medical professionals and technicians. The improvements in the camera and image processing capabilities of the Mobile Devices coupled with their improved processing power and an infinite processing and storage offered by Cloud Computing infrastructure opens up a window of opportunity to use them in the specialized field like microsurgery. To enable microsurgery, surgeons use optical microscope to zoom into the working area to get better visibility and control. However, these devices suffer from various drawbacks and are not comfortable to use. We build a Tablet with large stereoscopic screen allowing glasses free 3D display enabled by cameras capable of capturing 3D video and enhanced by an image processing pipeline, greatly improves the visibility and viewing comfort of the surgeon. Moreover using the capabilities of Cloud computing, these surgeries can be recorded and streamed live for education, training and consultation. An expert sitting in a geographically remote location can guide the surgeon performing the surgery. All vital parameters of the patient undergoing surgery can be shown as an overlay on the Tablet screen so that the surgeon is alerted of any parameter going beyond limit. Developing this kind of complex device involves engineering skills in hardware and software and huge amount of investments in terms of time, resources and money. To accelerate the development, we make use of open source hardware and software and demonstrate how we can accelerate the development using these open source resources. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Safety-critical systems and certification standards are the bare essential elements for the development process of avionics, automotive and industrial embedded systems. The necessity of including non-safety capabilities to reduce the price of these systems has resulted in a new type of critical systems, the mixed-criticality ones. These systems should be able to execute safety-critical applications but, at the same time, to run non-safety-critical functionalities without affecting the integrity of the safety-critical tasks. This paper presents a new system architecture which includes safety- critical and non-safety-critical parts in order to form a mixed-criticality system. The system consists of a reliable platform with a dual-core processor (implemented using a FPGA) architecture designed as open-hardware, running two isolated real time oper ating systems which are connected through a safe core-to-core communication channel that executes the safety-critical applications. Moreover, the safety-critical system is connected to an external processor, an ARM9, which is used as an external sensing system. The ARM9 runs the non-safety-critical applications and allows the system to insert modifications updating without affecting the safety capabilities of the safety- critical part. This platform is described providing evidences of the isolation between safety-critical (SC) and non-safety-critical (NSC) applications, as well as describing an updating methodology for non-safety-critical applications. This system is validated using a complete and reliable application for safe emergency stop applications for in- dustrial machinery. © J.UCS.

AB  - Technological devices of all kinds are becoming more common in our daily lives: smart devices are being incorporated in buildings, houses, cars, and public infrastructure such as roads and bridges. The new devices give us an unusual degree of connectivity in our regular activities, for example when we employ our tablets or smart phones to check email or browse the public network, but also in more innovative forms of connectivity, such as receiving notifications directly from our refrigerator or collecting information from our clothes and shoes. This technological revolution brings new opportunities and challenges for users, businesses, and society. This paper explores such a new context, where we begin to co-exist and interact with a network of interconnected devices that is known as the Internet of Things. The objective of the project is to implement a solution for communicating devices that monitor, in real-time, the structural health of a bridge. The implementation is based on 6LoWPAN, a standard based on the IPv6 protocol over low-power and lossy networks to support the Internet of Things. We employ open hardware platforms and emphasize the singularities of embedded systems, such as a limited number of operations, low power consumption, and low bandwidth capability. The prototype shown in this work uses the 6LoWPAN standard in a network environment that connects with a real Bridge Management System, with the aim of optimizing the maintenance of road structures. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - In 2015 NASA plans to launch a payload to 280 Km altitude on a sounding rocket from the Wallops Flight Facility. This payload will contain several novel technologies that work together to demonstrate methodologies for space sample return missions and for nanosatellite communications in general. The payload will deploy and test an Exo-Brake, which slows the payload aerodynamically, providing eventual de-orbit and recovery of future ISS samples through a Small Payload Quick Return project. In addition, this flight addresses future Mars mission entry technology, space-to-space communications using the Iridium Short Messaging Service (SMS), GPS tracking, and wireless sensors using the ZigBee protocol. SOAREX-8 is being assembled and tested at Ames Research Center (ARC) and the NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC) is funding sensor and communications work. Open source Arduino technology and software are used for system control. The ZigBee modules used are XBee units that connect analog sensors for temperature, air pressure and acceleration measurement wirelessly to the payload telemetry system. Our team is developing methods for power distribution and module mounting, along with software for sensor integration, data assembly and downlink. We have demonstrated relaying telemetry to the ground using the Iridium satellite constellation on a previous flight, but the upcoming flight will be the first time we integrate useful flight test data from a ZigBee wireless sensor network. Wireless sensor data will measure the aerodynamic efficacy of the Exo-Brake permitting further onorbit flight tests of improved designs. The Exo-Brake is 5 m2 in area and will be stored in a container and deployed during ascent once the payload is jettisoned from the launch vehicle. We intend to further refine the hardware and continue testing on balloon launches, future sounding rocket flights and on nanosatellite missions. The use of standards-based and opensource hardware/software has allowed for this project to be completed with a very modest budget and a challenging schedule. There is a wealth of hardware and software available for both the Arduino platform and the XBee, all low-cost or open-source. Along with the Exo-Brake hardware and deployment discussion, this paper will describe in detail the system architecture emphasizing the successful use of opensource hardware and software to minimize effort and cost. Testing procedures, radio frequency interference (RFI) mitigation, success criteria and expected results will also be discussed. The use of Iridium short messaging capability for space-to-space links, standards-based wireless sensor networks, and other innovative communications technology are also presented. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - BeagleBone Black is a low-cost, open hardware computer uniquely suited to interact with sensors and actuators directly and over the Web. Introduced in April 2013 by BeagleBoard.org, a community of developers first established in early 2008, BeagleBone Black is used frequently to build vision-enabled robots, home automation systems, artistic lighting systems, and countless other do-it-yourself and professional projects. BeagleBone variants include the original BeagleBone and the newer BeagleBone Black, both hosting a powerful 32-bit, super-scalar ARM Cortex A8 processor capable of running numerous mobile and desktop-capable operating systems, typically variants of Linux including Debian, Android, and Ubuntu. Yet, BeagleBone is small enough to fit in a small mint tin box. The "Bone" may be used in a wide variety of projects from middle school science fair projects to senior design projects to first prototypes of very complex systems. Novice users may access the power of the Bone through the user-friendly BoneScript software, experienced through a Web browser in most major operating systems, including Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X, or the Linux operating systems. Seasoned users may take full advantage of the Bone's power using the underlying Linux-based operating system, a host of feature extension boards (Capes) and a wide variety of Linux community open source libraries. This book provides an introduction to this powerful computer and has been designed for a wide variety of users including the first time novice through the seasoned embedded system design professional. The book contains background theory on system operation coupled with many well-documented, illustrative examples. Examples for novice users are centered on motivational, fun robot projects while advanced projects follow the theme of assistive technology and image-processing applications.

AB  - In the last decades drop-on-demand inkjet technology played an increasing role in industrial and medical applications. This is due to the ability to deposit a small amount of material in precisely defined position. In the field of Biofabrication, inkjet printers are used to build 2D and 3D scaffolds and gels with biological molecules, including living cells. Several works, including seminal papers on inkjet bioprinting, were carried out with modified office printers. These printers have fixed structural characteristics and operating size, especially on the print-head, limiting the range of materials that can be dispensed. The aim of the present work is the design and fabrication of an open-source piezoelectric inkjet print-head, optimized for the bioprinting field. This low-cost, reproducible, reliable, versatile and biocompatible device will enable various research laboratories to work with a shared device; the open source allowing for parts to be modified to suit specific needs. The design was carried out by Finite Element (FE) modeling of the piezoelectric, mechanical, fluid dynamics and their coupling. The design was optimized for shear rate, which we minimized in order to be able to print cells. The mechanical frame of the printer was designed and built using a low-cost 3D printer. The nozzle plate was fabricated from a polycarbonate disc coated with biocompatible silicone, to increase the hydrophobicity of the outer surface of the disc, preventing ink adhesion on the edge of the nozzle; the refilling system, and the electronic control were also part of the project and will be freely available to download. The FE models were validated with ad-hoc experiments, printing water, gelatin solution, and cell culture media, by modulating the wave power in amplitude, frequency and duty cycle. The tests showed a large working window both respect to viscosity and to surface tension. Finally Human Skin Fibroblasts (ATCC-CRL-2522, Teddington UK), suspended in culture media, were printed. Cell viability, assessed by CellTiter-Blue and LIVE / DEAD tests, resulted comparable with the control, demonstrating the validity of the first open source piezoelectric inkjet print-head for biofabrication. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - There are many potential applications in the utilities, critical infrastructure monitoring and control and environmental monitoring. This article charts the device-level technologies used in the creation the IoT, including hardware, software and communications. IoT's emergence coincided with the development of radio frequency identification (RFID) technology offering advantages such as the communicable range, ability to write data to a tag, and the possibility of reading multiple tags more efficiently with a single reader. RFID is now just one of many component IoT technologies. We have arrived at a situation where it is practically trivial to integrate computation and communication into any manufactured thing, and it is equally feasible to connect and technologically perceive natural things using communicable sensors. Furthermore, it is possible to react to, and control the environment using embedded computing devices coupled with actuators. Thorough comprehension of functional and non-functional requirements is necessary to develop an effective, efficient design specification for an IoT device. But given the large design space and complexity, there are numerous barriers to entry. As a result, many types of device have been adopted as practical de facto hardware development platforms across research communities, anc hacker and maker communities. In each case, intermediary 'operating systems', designed to simplify their programming by masking hardware complexity, are typically used. Their technical specifications are often not fully disclosed, but they do rely on well- defined standards to ensure the necessary interoperability. The majority of devices are characterised as single board computers. The final design for a market-ready product will likely be as efficient and cost-effective as possible in terms of design, but include sufficient redundancy to support software updates and potential shifts in standards. Since the early 2000s, the wireless sensor network community has worked with highly constrained devices characterised by limited energy, storage, communications, packet loss, etc. Incremental improvement! to hardware components have led to net energy efficiency improvements, increased computation for equivalent or less energy, more storage, etc. Algorithms and protocol! have been developed to further improve efficiency and reliability. The 'maker' movements have focused on open source hardware whereas those on the educationa side have sought to reduce the barriers to entry in terms of cost and simplification, e.g. the Raspberry Pi. Industrialists have increasingly tended to incorporate monitoring systems into their operations. Cellular connectivity has also been adopted and both are now converging on IoT. Although wireless connectivity has been central to the development of many IoT standards, devices with wired connections can also be part of the IoT. Indeed, many standards relevant to IoT are designed independent of the particular physical communications medium enabling seamless interoperability at higher layers and easing connectivity concerns in integrated applications. A number of approaches exist to developing software for IoT devices. As the computing power available increases, the ease with which one may programme the device tends to improve. The fewer resources that are available, the closer the software developer must get to the hardware. To reduce the complexity of programming devices, operating systems and associated programming languages have been designed or adapted to suit the embedded environment. Considering the more computationally powerful single board computers, certain flavours of Linux have been developed. High-end boards with significant processing capabilities are capable of running full-blown operating systems. Recently, mobile operating systems, such as Android, have been used, and stripped down versions have been touted by the big developers. From a devices perspective, it is easier than ever to connect a sensor, a controller, or a mundane household item to the Internet. On the other hand, there are still significant challenges to be overcome. With regard to industrial applications with strict performance requirements, multiple constraints, and often-difficult operational environments, work is far from complete.

AB  - This chapter examines the use of Open Source Software (OSS) technologies that can be used to improve the learning of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). Explored are the various methods that can be utilized to improve the percentage of STEM majors in the American educational system with resources such as: Open Source as Alternative (OSALT), virtualization, cloud computing, Linux distributions, open source programming, and open source hardware platforms. Increasing the amount of students that pursue STEM majors is important because the projected job growth in the STEM field compared to non-STEM jobs is 33%. OSALT provides cost-effective alternatives to commercial products such as Microsoft Office Suite and Adobe Photoshop. Second, creating Virtual Machines (VMs) is another avenue to teach complex concepts in computer science, engineering, and Information Technology (IT). Third, cloud computing is an inexpensive way for clients to access information from multiple locations and devices. Fourth, universities can use the Operating System (OS) Linux and its various distributions as replacements for commercial operating systems like Windows in order to reduce IT costs. Lastly, open source programming languages like Python and their associated Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provide comprehensive facilities for software engineers for application development or testing. © 2015, IGI Global.

AB  - In this paper we will summarize our research into the use of Open Source Hardware (OSHW) as a tool for communicating emergent scientific and technical knowledge via crafts. We were specifically interested in the microfabrication and microfluidic devices, which define the next generation of diagnostic and research tools often inaccessible to the larger public, but also to the scientists from the Global South. We used the traditional wayang kulit theater (shadow puppets) as a model for building microfluidic interfaces, which communicate emergent scientific issues to the larger public while testing the possibilities for DIY microfluidics. This culture-centered approach to design and science communication supports open science and citizen science projects. The prototype of a microfluidic shadow puppets' theater is discussed in the context of previous and future OSHW and crafts prototypes, which support culture-centered design. Copyright © ACM.

AB  - In this workshop children prototype simple digital games and physical user interfaces to play these games. Only open source hard-and software is used for the workshop. Developed in the course of an international practice-based research project on experimental approaches to media literacy, the workshop is part of xm:lab's School of Things, a cooperation with local secondary and vocational schools that engages school children in the processes of digital design, fabrication, and rapid prototyping. The workshop is presented not as a stand-alone activity that focuses on specific skill sets, but as part of an ongoing series aimed at developing a media literacy curriculum that can in turn be used by future facilitators to conduct their own workshops. Each workshop tests new ideas as well as a common pedagogical core that continues to be developed as we talk both with children participants and the teachers interesting in integrating such workshops into their own teaching.

AB  - Monitoring soil water content at high spatio-temporal resolution and coupled to other sensor data is crucial for applications oriented towards water sustainability in agriculture, such as precision irrigation or phenotyping root traits for drought tolerance. The cost of instrumentation, however, limits measurement frequency and number of sensors. The objective of this work was to design a low cost ―open hardware‖ platform for multi-sensor measurements including water content at different depths, air and soil temperatures. The system is based on an open-source ARDUINO microcontroller-board, programmed in a simple integrated development environment (IDE). Low cost high-frequency dielectric probes were used in the platform and lab tested on three non-saline soils (ECe1: 2.5 &lt; 0.1 mS/cm). Empirical calibration curves were subjected to cross-validation (leave-one-out method), and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) were respectively 0.09 for the overall model, 0.09 for the sandy soil, 0.07 for the clay loam and 0.08 for the sandy loam. The overall model (pooled soil data) fitted the data very well (R2 = 0.89) showing a high stability, being able to generate very similar RMSEs during training and validation (RMSEtraining = 2.63; RMSEvalidation = 2.61). Data recorded on the card were automatically sent to a remote server allowing repeated field-data quality checks. This work provides a framework for the replication and upgrading of a customized low cost platform, consistent with the open source approach whereby sharing information on equipment design and software facilitates the adoption and continuous improvement of existing technologies. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Power wheelchairs have high costs in developing countries, making its access difficult to the physically impaired, its main target audience, and to groups that develop assistive technologies, such as researchers, independent developers and entrepreneurs. Free software and open hardware have been successfully used to bridge access gap in areas where cost was a problem, democratizing the innovation process. This paper presents an open hardware and software platform developed for power wheelchairs, which aims to contribute to research and development in this area and stimulate local industry to implement affordable assistive technologies. We believe this work can be used as model for future research on open electronics platforms.

AB  - The rise of network speeds to tens of gigabits per second poses a challenge to develop packet processing applications that can cope with such bit rates. Therefore, the need for a suitable open source system that can be used as a prototype platform to test new network functionality while ensuring line-rate processing, accurate timestamping, and reduced power consumption has become evident. All these requirements cannot be achieved by using software-only solutions, but rather with hardware-based platforms such as NetFPGA. The main obstacle when using this type of open source FPGA-based solution is the cost of development, in both time and hardware development skills required. The spread of new circuit synthesis tools using high-level languages opens the door for the development of hardwarebased networking applications with reasonable development effort, compared to the use of traditional hardware description languages. In this article, we describe how existing open source hardware-based platforms for networking applications will be fueled by the change in the programming model of FPGAs provided by modern high-level synthesis tools. For this, we implemented a network flow monitor using high-level languages and compared the effort spent with respect to a traditional hardware development cycle. Preliminary results are very promising, given that development time is reduced from months to weeks. © 1986-2012 IEEE.

AB  - We describe a flexible, simple to build, low-cost, and computer-controlled optical mirror actuator system, developed for undergraduate research laboratories. Geared motors for hobby robotics are controlled by an Arduino microcontroller in combination with an H bridge to finely position mirror mount actuators. We present a graphical user interface based on the Python script language. The price of the fully controlled actuator system is only a small fraction of the price of a commercial system. It can be quickly implemented due to the use of open-hardware electronics. We discuss the performance of the system and give an outlook for future expansions and use in advanced optical setups. © 2015 American Association of Physics Teachers.

AB  - This chapter examines the use of Open Source Software (OSS) technologies that can be used to improve the learning of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). Explored are the various methods that can be utilized to improve the percentage of STEM majors in the American educational system with resources such as: Open Source as Alternative (OSALT), virtualization, cloud computing, Linux distributions, open source programming, and open source hardware platforms. Increasing the amount of students that pursue STEM majors is important because the projected job growth in the STEM field compared to non-STEM jobs is 33%. OSALT provides cost-effective alternatives to commercial products such as Microsoft Office Suite and Adobe Photoshop. Second, creating Virtual Machines (VMs) is another avenue to teach complex concepts in computer science, engineering, and Information Technology (IT). Third, cloud computing is an inexpensive way for clients to access information from multiple locations and devices. Fourth, universities can use the Operating System (OS) Linux and its various distributions as replacements for commercial operating systems like Windows in order to reduce IT costs. Lastly, open source programming languages like Python and their associated Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provide comprehensive facilities for software engineers for application development or testing. © 2014 by IGI Global.

AB  - Background: Many neuroscience experiments rely on presenting stimuli and measuring participants' responses to these events. Often computer screens, speakers and keyboards are sufficient. However, these devices are not appropriate for some situations. For example, some studies present tactile or olfactory stimuli or brain stimulation. Likewise, keyboard buttons are not appropriate for use with vocal responses, small animals or individuals with motor impairments. New method: We describe StimSync, which simulates USB keyboard inputs, allowing use with most experimental software. StimSync can measure button presses, optical signals from magnetic resonance imaging systems, changes in ambient light (e.g. synchronizing intracranial electrography), and auditory events (a voice key). In addition to the USB keyboard mode (necessarily millisecond precision), StimSync can also be set to provide higher precision timing. This feature can be used to validate timing, ensuring event synchronization (e.g. auditory events, visual events, brain stimulation). In addition to recording inputs, StimSync provides seven digital outputs for controlling external devices. Finally, StimSync can record analog inputs; we illustrate how this can be used to evaluate the rise time for computer displays. Results: We observed outputs with a mean latency of 2.1. ms (sd=. 0.17. ms) and USB inputs with a mean latency of 2. ms (sd=. 0.54. ms). Comparison with existing method(s): StimSync statistically outperforms two professional solutions and numerically outperforms other devices described in the literature. Conclusions: StimSync (http://www.mccauslandcenter.sc.edu/CRNL/tools/stimsync) provides an open-source solution for controlling and validating neuroscience experiments. In addition to sharing the design, we have produced a batch of devices to demonstrate the market for professional implementations. © 2014.

AB  - Turbidity is an internationally recognized criterion for assessing drinking water quality, because the colloidal particles in turbid water may harbor pathogens, chemically reduce oxidizing disinfectants, and hinder attempts to disinfect water with ultraviolet radiation. A turbidimeter is an electronic/optical instrument that assesses turbidity by measuring the scattering of light passing through a water sample containing such colloidal particles. Commercial turbidimeters cost hundreds or thousands of dollars, putting them beyond the reach of low-resource communities around the world. An affordable open-source turbidimeter based on a single light-to-frequency sensor was designed and constructed, and evaluated against a portable commercial turbidimeter. The final product, which builds on extensive published research, is intended to catalyze further developments in affordable water and sanitation monitoring. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Open source hardware is increasingly becoming popular within the makers community, and many organizations are finding ways to leverage the new phenomenon. Open source processes are fundamentally different because they are driven by evolutionary processes, as compared to traditional hierarchical design processes. Hence, a critical driving factor for their success is the ability to use and to make improvements and modifications over existing designs. Making modifications in simple products, where the changes in one aspect of the product do not propagate to other aspects, is relatively easier than in complex products. Currently, such modifications are difficult to perform on complex hardware products, thereby limiting the evolution of open source hardware products. In this chapter, we discuss some of these technological and knowledge barriers faced by the open hardware community in modifying and validating open hardware products. The discussion is guided by an illustrative example of an open source 3D printer. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the open hardware graphics accelerator (ORGFX), there are rectangle, line, triangle and curve rasterization modules. This paper is only focused on the improvement of line rasterization speed. Besides modifying the algorithm itself, hardware implementation and resource consumption are put into consideration here. Originally, ORGFX uses the classic Bresenham line algorithm with high precision and simple logic to rasterize lines, but this algorithm can only generate one pixel in each rasterization process, which results in efficiency relatively low. New algorithm in this paper combines Bresenham algorithm with the symmetry nature of lines, advantages of Bresenham algorithm are kept and rasterization speed is improved in this way. The results of experiments show that nearly 50 percent of time can be saved through software implementation and hardware implementation. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - This paper demonstrates the use of open source hardware and software to implement the digital back end of a network of radars. i.e. RHINO platform - a highly capable reconfigurable platform serving both digitisation / synthesis and packetisation functions for a dual X and L band radar. The system is capable of arbitrary waveform generation for transmit, and can be configured at runtime and reprogrammed in the field if required. Two digitisation cards (FMC format) are used to capture the X and L band receive signals, and a DAC is used for waveform synthesis. The digital back end bandpass samples to lower both sample and data rates, and streams data to a processing back-end over a 1GBe link. The work shown here concentrates on this implementation, and highlights the current and expected performance for each subsystem. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - The ever-intensifying time-to-market pressure imposes great challenges on the pre-silicon design phase of hardware. Before the tape-out, a pre-silicon design has to be thoroughly inspected by time-consuming functional verification and code review to exclude bugs. For functional verification and code review, a critical issue determining their efficiency is the allocation of resources (e.g., computational resources and manpower) to different modules of a design, which is conventionally guided by designers' experiences. Such practices, though simple and straightforward, may take high risks of wasting resources on bug-free modules or missing bugs in buggy modules, and thus could affect the success and timeline of the tape-out. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called pre-silicon bug forecast to predict the bug information of hardware designs. In this framework, bug models are built via machine learning techniques to characterize the relationship between design characteristics and the bug information, which can be leveraged to predict how bugs distribute in different modules of the current design. Such predicted bug information is adequate to regulate the resources among different modules to achieve efficient functional verification and code review. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed pre-silicon bug forecast framework, we conducted detailed experiments on several open-source hardware projects. Moreover, we also investigate the impacts of different learning techniques and different sets of characteristic on the performance of bug models. Experimental results show that with appropriate learning techniques and characteristics, about 90% modules could be correctly predicted as buggy or clean and the number of bugs of each module could also be accurately predicted. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - This paper explains the implementation of a low cost, non-intrusive home energy monitoring system. The design implementation of the proof of concept employs open-source hardware architecture using Arduino and off-the-shelf sensors which lends itself to mass production, low cost and easy maintenance. This system is intended to service rural and low income urban consumers who will not be able to afford existing sophisticated and expensive home automation systems. A device identification module (DIM) that recognizes the devices in use at every room is implemented. The energy usage is continuously monitored and the user is notified of his consumption over a twenty four hour period. As many of the intended users are possible first time energy consumers, the energy monitoring system will inculcate a sense of energy consciousness and ensure grass root level sustainability. The energy consumption data is logged in the system and can be used by the utility service provider (USP) for future system planning, optimization and demand side management. The proof of concept developed and tested under laboratory conditions costs under USD 11 and will reduce further on commercialization. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - In the recent years technology education has gained importance worldwide. Colombian government has included it in the basic and secondary schools curriculum, but the current teaching-learning strategies and the resources used for technology class have proven to be insufficient. This paper presents a case study for implementing Project-Based learning in a Colombian high school, using Open source Hardware and Software. First, a set of technological competencies are defined for technology class, based on the suggestions of the Ministry of National Education. Then, a project for designing an irrigation system for the school orchard is presented, which will engage students to develop the selected technological competencies. Subsequently, a set of didactic tools for the project are presented, including an electronic platform for the control of the water flux in the irrigation system. The project will be implemented during the following months, and through diagnostic and summative assessment it is expected to measure the improvement of the technological competencies in students. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Open Source Software is a vital catalyst within the academic robotics community. Frameworks built on open software, like the Robot Operating System (ROS) and the family of libraries that have grown up around it, ease the process by which researchers and students can create integrated, working systems. This has allowed those who have little experience or academic interest in areas like software engineering, communications or artificial intelligence, to make use of others' contributions and build on them in their own areas of expertise. The Open Academic Robot Kit seeks to foster a similar community around open hardware designs for flexible, customised, low cost academic and research robots. It leverages recent advances in 3D printing and the mass production of microcontroller boards, sensors, smart servos and other components for the Maker community. The emphasis is on the ease with which other researchers, students and members of the wider hobbyist and Maker communities, in different fields, may contribute, replicate and extend the designs. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Environmental data are critical to understanding environmental phenomena. This paper describes the design and development of a low-cost environmental monitoring system including sensor, data logger, and transmitter using several low-cost, open-source, mass-produced components. The system is connected to the open source Hydrologic Information System (HIS) software created by the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Sciences Inc. (CUAHSI) through a web service interface to the HIS HydroServer Lite. It is expected that this connection will enable the ingestion into the CUAHI HIS of near-real-time data collected by our low-cost device or similar devices through HydroServer. By publishing data in this way, it becomes discoverable through the GIS-based CUAHSI tools, HydroDesktop and HydroShare. Additionally, because it follows WaterML encoding, open hardware data stored in the HIS can be included in international catalogues such as the Global Earth Observation System of System (GEOSS) catalogue.

AB  - Practices related to open source hardware and software, open design and digital fabrication demonstrate new ways for designing and producing things. In the domain of open source technology, novel paradigms emerge in which customization is combined with personal fabrication, product development is expanded by users' co-design, open licenses replace the traditional patents system. We assume that the impact of those paradigms activate opportunities for developing new design approaches that consider products as platforms: similarly to open source prototyping platforms such as Arduino, "products- platforms" feature several interactive layers that enable people to access, reconfigure and build upon the physical parts, behaviors and interfaces of the product. The workshop aims to engage participants in an experimental process addressed to the conception of interactive "products-platforms" that are open source artifacts that users can modify or build upon thanks to an ecosystem of shared documentation, services and licenses. In particular, the participants will focus on the definition of solutions for facilitating the configuration, customization and re-production of the interactive product, by discussing the limits and the opportunities of the current open source ecosystem (technology, interfaces, communities, etc.). The workshop reflects on the integration of the human centered design approach into the open source culture and it proposes a framework for designing innovative open source products.

AB  - Prototyping and engineering robot hardware and low-level control often require time and efforts thus subtracted to core research activities, such as SLAM or planning algorithms development, which need a working, reliable, platform to be evaluated in a real world scenario. In this paper, we present Rapid Robot Prototyping (R2P), an open source, hardware and software architecture for the rapid prototyping of robotic applications, where off-the-shelf embedded modules (e.g., sensors, actuators, and controllers) are combined together in a plug-and-play fashion, enabling the implementation of a complex system in a simple and modular way. R2P makes people involved in robotics, from researchers and designers to students and hobbyists, dramatically reduce the time and efforts required to build a robot prototype. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Rapid prototyping is a key aspect for the development of innovative robotic applications. A modular, platform-based, approach is the way to obtain this result. Modular approaches are common for software development, but hardware is still crafted often re-inventing solutions every time. As a consequence, the resources that should be invested in the development of a new robot get often drained by the implementation of a physical, working prototype to test the application idea. To overcome this problem, we propose R2P (Rapid Robot Prototyping), a framework to implement real-time, high-quality architectures for robotic systems with off-the-shelf basic modules (e.g., sensors, actuators, and controllers), integrating hardware and software, which can be assembled in a plug-and-play way. R2P provides hardware modules, a protocol for real-time communication, a middleware to connect components as well as tools to support the development of software on the modules. R2P aims at dramatically reduce time and efforts required to build a prototype robot, making it possible to focus the resources on the development of new robotic applications instead of struggling on their implementation. This enables also people with experience in a specific application domain, but with little technical background, to actively participate in the development of new robotic applications. R2P is open-source both in its software and hardware to promote its diffusion among the robotics community and novel business models that will substantially reduce the costs to design a new robotic product. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - LittleBits (little Bits.cc) is an open-source hardware library of pre-assembled analogue components that can be easily assembled into circuits, disassembled, reassembled, and re-used. In this paper, we consider littleBits - and the littleBits SynthKit in particular - as a physically-embodied domain specific programming language. We describe the littleBits system, explain how littleBits 'programs' are constructed as configurations of physical modules in the real world, and describe how they are typically used to control physical artefacts or constructions. We then argue that littleBits constructions essentially 'visualise themselves'. We describe how littleBits' liveness, embodiment, and plasticity assists both learning and debugging, and then evaluate littleBits configurations according to the cognitive dimensions of notations. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Wireless Sensor Networks is a growing research field and often researchers use a development platform to implement their experimental ideas and protocols. Wireless sensor network development boards provide interfaces to hardware, radios, real time operating systems, and routing protocols, allowing quick implementation of ideas. However, the selection of WSN development boards available is limited, and sometimes, depending on the popularity of the platform, support and resources are scarce. In this paper, a development platform design is presented, which employs commonly used and widely supported open source hardware and software. The board is also designed to use standard hardware interfaces to make adding additional sensors an easy task. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Color science is perhaps the most universally tangible discipline within the optical sciences for people of all ages. Excepting a small and relatively well-understood minority, we can see that the world around us consists of a multitude of colors; yet, describing the "what", "why", and "how" of these colors is not an easy task, especially without some sort of equally colorful visual aids. While static displays (e.g., poster boards, etc.) serve their purpose, there is a growing trend, aided by the recent permeation of small interactive devices into our society, for interactive and immersive learning. However, for the uninitiated, designing software and hardware for this purpose may not be within the purview of all optical scientists and engineers. Enter open source. Open source "anything" are those tools and designs-hardware or software-that are available and free to use, often without any restrictive licensing. Open source software may be familiar to some, but the open source hardware movement is relatively new. These are electronic circuit board designs that are provided for free and can be implemented in physical hardware by anyone. This movement has led to the availability of some relatively inexpensive, but quite capable, computing power for the creation of small devices. This paper will showcase the design and implementation of the software and hardware that was used to create an interactive demonstration kit for color. Its purpose is to introduce and demonstrate the concepts of color spectra, additive color, color rendering, and metamers. © 2014 SPIE.

AB  - This paper presents the state-of-the-art for building a low cost mobile robot with open-source technology based on sensor fusion. Designing open-source educational robots has a great impact on empowering engineers and those interested in mobile robots. In the last decade, different robots have been designed and built for this purpose. In this project, with the help of sensors available on a 9-axis open-source IMU and a robot based on open-source hardware and control software, a graphical user interface has been implemented to view the condition of motion variables in a real-time manner and combine sensor data. Moreover, by implementing different filter programs, such as low-pass filter, complementary filter and by using KF implementation and deliberation this mobile robot becomes suitable for improving the accuracy of the robot in extracting parameters required for localization, mapping and robot navigation. Features of the developed robot, the so-called TL-OSR, can be regarded as: using open-source hardware and software with real-time performance, low price equipment, presenting a solution based on sensor fusion for better accuracy in robot navigation and using different types of sensors. This robot can be used as an suitable open-source platform as a new class of mobile robots for educational and research purposes in mechatronics and robotics. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Decision making of a vertebrate in response to the sensory signals from the environment is regulated by the neuromodulatory systems in its brain. A vertebrate's behaviors like focusing attention, cautious risk-aversion and curiosity-seeking exploration are influenced by these neuromodulators. The paper presents an autonomous robotic control approach based on vertebrate neuromodulation and its implementation on multiple open-source hardware platforms. A simple neural network is used to model the neuromodulatory functions for generating context based behavioral responses to sensory signals. The neural network incorporates three types of neurons-attention focusing cholinergic and noradrenergic (ACh/NE), curiosity-seeking dopaminergic (DA), and risk aversive serotonergic (5-HT) neurons. The implementation of the neuronal model on multiple relatively simple autonomous robots is illustrated through the interesting behavior of the robots adapting to changes in the environment. The implementation is done in open-source, open-access robotics software framework of Robot Operating System (ROS). Copyright © 2014 by ASME.

AB  - FPGA-based SoCs have been gaining great favors among traditional applications and expanding the application domains to some new areas. Reusing and sharing components is an attractive and pratical methodology for system designers to reduce the design complexity of the SoC architectures. Open source hardware has become an effective method of improving the design productivity. As the core functional component, processors affects the performance of SoC systems. This paper investigates existing open source processors, and gives an overview. From the points of usability and stability, the main features of open source processors are summarized. Following these features, some open source processors with high usability and stability are selected. These open source processors and existing vendor-provided soft processors are implemented on Stratix V and Virtex-7 FPGAs using corresponding EDA tools, Quart us n and ISE. The implementation results are compared and discussed. © 2014 Technical University of Munich (TUM).

AB  - Global warming is an issue that keeps coming up recently with the increase of temperature and carbon dioxide level. Scientist believes that the main cause of this is because of the deforestation, pollution, carbon emission from transportation and factories that led to this global warming. However, there are also skeptics that believe otherwise. To prove the cause of global warming and whether it is an event that occurs every now and then as some skeptics and scientists suggested a multi sensor device is build, which consist of temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide and oxygen. With limited funding and a few different location to be tested to prove this phenomena, a low cost device is built so that it will be within the budget of this project as well give the result that is to determine whether development has cause the global warming and forest and absorbing the CO2 emission to keep the world cool. Thanks to open source hardware, the sensor system can be build economically. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - The robot open source software community, in particular ROS, drastically boosted robotics research. However, a centralized place to exchange open hardware designs does not exist. Therefore we launched the Robotic Open Platform (ROP). A place to share and discuss open hardware designs. Among others it currently contains detailed descriptions of Willow Garage's TurtleBot, the NimbRo-OP created by the University of Bonn and the AMIGO robot of Tech United Eindhoven. Eventually, ROP will contain a collection of affordable hardware components, allowing researchers to focus on cutting-edge research on a particular component instead of having to design the entire robot from scratch. As an example of how the Robotic Open Platform is able to facilitate this knowledge transfer, we introduce TURTLE-5k: A redesign of an existing soccer robot by a consortium of our university and companies in the wider Eindhoven area. Cooperating with industrial partners resulted in a significant cost reduction. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - This paper explains the design of a communication system, using an Arduino microcontroller and GSM Module and its functions / associated components to be implemented in a microgrid. The microgrid control and coordination infrastructure has been realized as a hierarchical multi-agent system (MAS) comprising of the DG agents, the Mu agent and the D agent. The Communication (Mu) Agent acts as a link between the lower-level microgrid agents (distributed energy resources (DERs), the load, the storage and the utility grid) which provide the required digital parameter inputs, and the Control Agent comprising of the Cloud. Data storage, analytics and control commands are generated based on the rule engine updates given by the Utility Service Provider (USP) to the Cloud. The microgrid side input data are converted into appropriate GPRS signals within the Arduino. The specific functions that enable this conversion are elucidated as pseudocode. Further, the cloud control commands are sent back to the various microgrid-side agents via the Mu agent as GPRS signals. The communication strategy has been explained in detail and has been implemented using Arduino keeping in mind system costs, ease of operability and maintenance. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents a low-cost open source prototype of a gesture recognition and interpretation glove that aids audio-vocally impaired individuals in communication. A sensor based glove for recognition of the gestures in the American Sign Language (ASL) is the input module to the system. It incorporates resistive flex sensors and contact sensors appropriately positioned to obtain a theoretical efficiency of 96% in character recognition. When the sensors are subjected to change in orientation by the user, the variation in electrical resistance of each of the individual sensors is obtained as the input to an Arduino ATMega328 microcontroller that accurately maps it to the letters of the English alphabet through an efficient algorithm. An elegant methodology that is easy to implement using a microcontroller is employed for the mapping process to minimize the complexity of the system. The paper also presents a detailed study of the efficiency characteristics involved in the construction of the custom-designed flex sensors utilized in the system. The paper outlines the calibration and testing results of the sensors.The highlights of the system are its ergonomic and economical design, portability and intelligent gesture recognition and interpretation ability. The implemented system achieves a practical efficiency of up to 80% of theoretical efficiency. The cost of the system is approximately less than USD 5 at laboratory condition using off the shelf components. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - In this modern world many communication devices are highly intelligent and interconnected between each other. Any up-gradation of the hardware in the existing communication devices is not easier one. Compatibility of the new hardware with existing hardware is highly essential. But the new protocols may or may not support the older one. The solution for these problems can be provided by using the reconfigurable hardware design. The hardware can be reprogrammed according to the new change in technology up-gradation. The cost of commercially available hardware and software requirements for setting up such a module is very high. This can be solved by using Open source hardware and software such as Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) and GNU Radio. This work demonstrates how the modern analog communication system like Community Radio Schemes and Radio Data System (RDS) and digital communication systems such as Simple Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) and OFDM based data communication can be developed using the Open source hardware USRP1. This work will be helpful even for first year level of engineering students to easily implement any communication and control applications with cheaper cost. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The diagnosis of electrical motors through the detection of fault frequency signatures in the current's spectrum has become an established standard in the field of industrial maintenance systems. Nevertheles, its implementation on devices with low computing power remains a practical challenge. Industrial controllers, such as programmable logic controllers, or modern, low cost controller hardware, such as the Arduino or the Raspberry Pi open source hardware proposals, lack both the on-board memory and the high speed data acquisition hardware to perform an accurate spectral analysis of the machine's current, in order to identify the spectral components produced by each type of fault. In this paper, a signal conditioning unit, based on a novel downsampling method of the current, is presented. This unit reduces the amount of current samples that must be processed by the diagnostic unit to a mere sample per current cycle, maintains the sub-hertz accuracy needed to resolve fault, and converts the mains component into a constant value that can be easily eliminated without using any additional filter. Besides, it is implemented using low cost devices, just resistors and operational amplifiers. The proposed method is theoretically developed in this paper, and it has been validated using induction motors with broken bars fed directly by the mains or through variable speed drives. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Purpose: The democratization of invention is a long lasting desire for the advancement of society. Having access to education and the means of production appears as the major factors for the implementation of this goal. 3D printing is a revolutionary technology that has the potential to bring digital manufacturing to everyone. However, the rise of personal fabrication requires an increase in printing quality, a reduction on machine cost and an increase in knowledge shared by the open hardware community. The purpose of this paper is to explore the development of a new Open Hardware printer project to address these points. Design/methodology/approach: The authors have designed and constructed a low-cost photopolymer-based 3D printer called BeamMaker. The printer is connected to a host computer and a digital-light-processing projector. This work details the design process and how improvements were implemented to reach good printing quality. The authors provide public access to the instructions, software, source code, parts list, user manual and STL and CAD files. Findings: The BeamMaker printer can build objects with a high surface quality that is comparable to the quality obtained by industrial photopolymer-based 3D printers. When testing the ability to print a sample cylinder, the printer shows higher accuracy when compared to other personal 3D printers. These findings are encouraging considering the low cost of the system. Research limitations/implications: The printing failure rate of the system has not been measured to date. The system requires some improvements to produce large objects. Practical implications: The printer cost is just USD380. This is five to eight times less expensive than popular personal 3D printers available today. The cost is 30 times less expensive than a personal photopolymer 3D printer produced by a main commercial company and yet producing results of similar quality. The authors expect good avenues for collaboration from the open-source community to continue improving these systems. Social implications: The high cost of current personal 3D printers prevents users from developing countries from entering into the open hardware trend. A dramatic reduction in printer cost such as that explored in this work might contribute to the real democratization of personal fabrication. Originality/value: The authors report on the status of three other photopolymer-based personal 3D printer projects. To the best of the authors' knowledge, BeamMaker is the first fully open hardware 3D printer project which uses this technology. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Automatic control, as well as the introduction to programming, are subjects increasingly being taught to young engineering students. For this reason the availability of a suitable platform for the laboratory work becomes a critical decision, in order to promote students' motivation to experience the theoretical concepts studied in the classroom. Until recently, the only option to perform laboratory work in this kind of subjects was to use closed platforms commercially available but today, thanks to advances in technology, many open hardware options supporting standard and intuitive programming languages are available. In order to provide a multidisciplinary low cost open platform for the automatic control introductory courses, an example of open-source educational platform easily programmable composed by a differential mobile robot with a robotic arm manipulator is presented in this paper. © IFAC.

AB  - To cope with a large disaster such as that caused by a large earthquake, it is necessary to gather seismic information and building damage data. This paper describes open source hardware (OSHW) with various sensors and a wireless communication system used as a new device to measure the strength of an earthquake and the extent of building damage. The OSHW assessed in this study is inexpensive and readily accessible. Therefore, the spread of wireless sensor network with the OSHW is expected. For this study, an acceleration sensor is used to conduct the following examinations. First, a component of OSHW with the wireless sensor network is explained, as are its specifications. Secondly, simple and extensive applications for the system for gathering seismic information and building damage data are proposed. Thirdly, future subjects of these applications are defined. Several fundamental test results are presented. Finally, the effectiveness of this seismic information gathering system is discussed. © ASCE 2014.

AB  - The developing world remains plagued by lack of access to safe drinking water. Although many low-cost methods have been developed to treat contaminated water, low-cost methods for water-quality testing are necessary to determine if these appropriate technologies are needed, effective, and reliable. This paper provides a methodology for the design, development, and technical validation of a low-cost, open-source (OS) water testing platform. A case study is presented where the platform is developed to provide both the colorimetry for biochemical oxygen demand/chemical oxygen demand and nephelometry to measure turbidity using method ISO 7027. This approach resulted in equipment that is as accurate, but costs between 7.5 and 15 times less than current commercially available tools. It is concluded that OS hardware development is a promising solution for the equipment necessary to perform water quality measurements in both developed and developing regions. © IWA Publishing 2014.

AB  - The rapid advancement of low cost embedded systems invites engineering educators to deliver content and skills while engaging students in hands-on projects that may potentially make use of a variety of platforms. From proprietary to open source hardware and software, from microcontrollers to embedded operating systems (OS) devices, students today are challenged to accelerate their learning pace by working on real-world projects in a supervised environment. Currently, students rely on self-guidance in order to develop the knowledge base necessary for achieving the goals of their team projects with respect to embedded systems. This paper presents the results of an embedded systems programming tutorial piloted with a group of 15 undergraduate students from across the engineering disciplines and with a mix of sophomores through seniors. The tutorial included a series of three lecture modules prepared to introduce concepts on embedded systems. The modules were tightly coupled with hands-on exercises that employed the DE2i-150 development board, aimed to introduce students to the development of digital systems based on an Altera field programmable gate array (FPGA) in conjunction with an Linux-based embedded OS running on an Intel Atom processor. The first module provides an overview of the various inputs, outputs, sensors, and displays of the board. The second module introduces the embedded OS and guides students in establishing a high-speed Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) link between the Atom processor and the FPGA. The third module focuses on implementing a custom C/++ application written by students for real- Time processing of inputs from four push buttons. Results show that the three lecture modules of 30 minutes each, coupled with the hands-on projects, offer a good introduction to the complexity of the DE2i-150 board. Surveys collected before the first module and after the third show a generally positive outcome. Recommendations for future efforts focus on incorporating more complex C/++ applications concurrent with FPGA development. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2014.

AB  - The environmental monitoring system apparently appears to be an easy tool, but it hides some drawbacks such as high purchase and maintenance costs. This implies that the use of technologies to monitor cultural heritage is somewhat limited to analyze sites where the degradation conditions are of particular relevance. With this in mind, the aim of such a research activity is to compare two monitoring systems in relation with the decay problems affecting the paintings of the crypt of St. Francesco d’Assisi in Irsina (Basilicata, Southern Italy). The first system is a low-cost Arduino wireless platform based on opensource hardware and user friendly software. The second monitoring equipment is a standard commercial product. The basic idea of such a comparison is to attempt to reduce greatly the costs as well as significantly increase the applicability of long-term monitoring systems on a large scale. © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, London.

AB  - The German Federal Office for Radiation Protection operates a network of about 1800 gamma dose rate stations as a part of the national emergency preparedness plan. Each of the six network centres is capable of operating the network alone. Most of the used hardware and software have been developed in-house under open-source license. Short development cycles and close cooperation between developers and users ensure robustness, transparency and fast maintenance procedures, thus avoiding unnecessary complex solutions. This also reduces the overall costs of the network operation. An easy-to-expand web interface has been developed to make the complete system available to other interested network operators in order to increase cooperation between different countries. The interface is also regularly in use for education during scholarships of trainees supported, e.g. by the 'International Atomic Energy Agency' to operate a local area dose rate monitoring test network. © The Author 2014.

AB  - The Internet of Things makes use of a huge disparity of technologies at very different levels that help one to the other to accomplish goals that were previously regarded as unthinkable in terms of ubiquity or scalability. If the Internet of Things is expected to interconnect every day devices or appliances and enable communications between them, a broad range of new services, applications and products can be foreseen. For example, monitoring is a process where sensors have widespread use for measuring environmental parameters (temperature, light, chemical agents, etc.) but obtaining readings at the exact physical point they want to be obtained from, or about the exact wanted parameter can be a clumsy, time-consuming task that is not easily adaptable to new requirements. In order to tackle this challenge, a proposal on a system used to monitor any conceivable environment, which additionally is able to monitor the status of its own components and heal some of the most usual issues of a Wireless Sensor Network, is presented here in detail, covering all the layers that give it shape in terms of devices, communications or services.

AB  - While cornerstone and capstone courses teach 'design' at the beginning and end of many computer engineering programs, a design gap is left in the sophomore and junior years. This paper describes the development and experiences of teaching five semesters of a specialized design course for a computer engineering program taught in the junior year. The course includes topics in software design patterns, multi-threaded applications, rudimentary user-interface design, embedded programming including sensor building and processing, and Zigbee-based wireless communications. The course is 2 semester credits (1-2-3), and includes a comprehensive project that requires students to build a tangible game or a game-like entertainment system. One key component of the course is the use of an open-source hardware platform called Arduino. The results are that students enjoy the course and are able to build integrated systems that incorporate design patterns, multithreading, embedded programming and wireless communication in an effective manner within one semester. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - The Internet of Things, otherwise known as IoT, IPv6 or Industr y 4.0 is going to become wider, linking 25 billion smart devices and intelligent systems in operation around the world. Ethernet-based networks, such as EtherCAT, allow every part of an automation system, from sensors to robots, to exchange information at high speeds. This gives the controller instant access to every detail of production information. Once this controller is also connected to the enterprise-level Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP) or Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES). End-user IT departments will have to work more closely with engineering to allow shop-floor equipment to have direct access to enterprise-level systems without the use of middleware. The latest controllers, such as Omron's Sysmac NJ series, combine the reliability and rugged design of a traditional PLC, but use an open hardware architecture combined with software ?engines' within a single CPU, rather than multiple CPUs, to manage their different functions. Ricoh plans to use similar instant communication with an enterprise-level database to scan codes on used toner cartridges sent to its Telford site for recycling. In this case, an NJ controller will allow data, including the number of previous refills, to be checked. This will in turn enable the system to determine whether any given cartridge should be refilled again, while also updating the database. The FAG SmartCheck from Schaeffler FAG recognises and reports the first vibrations of a system long before any noise is generated. That means there is substantially longer time to react before the machine fails.

AB  - The data centre at the Galician Institute of High Energy Physics (IGFAE) of the Santiago de Compostela University (USC) is a computing cluster with about 150 nodes and 1250 cores that hosts the LHCb Tiers 2 and 3. In this small data centre, and of course in similar or bigger ones, it is very important to keep optimal conditions of temperature, humidity and pressure. Therefore, it is a necessity to monitor the environment and be able to trigger alarms when operating outside the recommended settings. There are currently many tools and systems developed for data centre monitoring, but until recent years all of them were of commercial nature and expensive. In recent years there has been an increasing interest in the use of technologies based on Arduino due to its open hardware licensing and the low cost of this type of components. In this article we describe the system developed to monitor IGFAE's data centre, which integrates an Arduino controlled sensor network with the Nagios monitoring software. Sensors of several types, temperature, humidity and pressure, are connected to the Arduino board. The Nagios software is in charge of monitoring the various sensors and, with the help of Nagiosgraph, to keep track of the historic data and to produce the plots. An Arduino program, developed in house, provides the Nagios plugin with the readout of one or several sensors depending on the plugin's request. The Nagios plugin for reading the temperature sensors also broadcasts an SNMP trap when the temperature gets out of the allowed operating range. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - A key issue in VoIP services market is the availability of tools that permit a constant monitoring of the relevant Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. Several commercial and open-source solutions are available, based on dedicated hardware and/or open-source software. These solutions aim to achieve a tradeoff between performance and instrumentation cost. In general, high performance and precise monitoring tools are based on dedicated hardware, which is expensive. In contrast, cheaper software-based solutions working on top of a Commercially available Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware are performance-limited, especially when serving high-capacity links. In this context, the paper presents an open-source solution for QoS monitoring of VoIP traffic that achieves high performance at significantly lower costs. The proposed solution exploits the performance capabilities achievable with a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The associated costs reduction arises from the high flexibility of an FPGA. Our experimental analysis explores the accuracy of the developed prototype, measuring against relevant QoS parameters of VoIP traffic on high capacity links. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.

AB  - In teaching undergraduate automatic controls, the laboratory experience is an important and irreplaceable component. Historically, good platforms for a controls laboratory have been expensive, because the equipment has typically been very specialized for educational purposes. Moreover, the equipment often is not physically robust in the face of student manhandling, creating major difficulties and costs in maintaining such a lab. The advent of inexpensive open-source controller hardware is revolutionizing this situation because it is now possible to have good controls-hardware capability at relatively low cost. The Arduino Mega 2560, in particular, is supported by Matlab, Simulink and LabView, and thus provides a great deal of flexibility in developing laboratory procedures for students to study controls. The Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on flexible, easy-touse hardware and software. The "motor shield" is an add-on (daughterboard) to the Arduino that further enables control of dc motors. This paper explains a method and hardware to connect an Arduino to a separately-powered dc-motor unit. Matlab and Simulink provide full support of the Arduino board for feedback-controller design. The Arduino board is powered by, and communicates with Simulink, through a standard USB connection.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to describe a Product Lifecycle Management process for IEEE's Humanitarian Technology (HT) 'Solutions' that leverages IEEE's peer-review. In 2011, the Humanitarian Initiatives Committee (HIC) of IEEE Region 7 organized a student design competition [1] with the specific objective of understanding the design process of HT 'Solutions' to be made available as open source. The 2011 competition was an initial effort to understand open source licensing, open source hardware and the open source development model. Adoption of the open source development model was a stated objective of IEEE's Humanitarian technology Challenge (HTC) [2]. The HIC held a student paper competition in 2013. The goal of the 2013 competition was to nurture the growing interest in Humanitarian Technology in Region 7; to address HIC's concerns from the 2011 competition, more effort was focused in the paper review process for the 2013 competition and standard IEEE peer-review tools and processes were used. This document presents in Section III the lessons learned during these two competitions, and proposes in section IV a Product Lifecycle Management framework for the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) of OSI development that leverages IEEE's peer-review process. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Today, the environmental monitoring and quality have a growing interest. This promotes the development of new monitoring tools, and especially those with outstanding reliability and response time, and nonstationary features. This paper presents the design and implementation of a transportable gas detection and environmental monitoring device. Ideas taken from the Arduino and Lego constructions are kept in mind during the design of the device, looking further facilitate the development of product family of this device; likewise, the use of reconfigurable and interconnectable platforms with open hardware are considered. The transducers have been selected based on their reliability, small size and easy inclusion in an electronic system. Then, was developed a device that supports transducers for environmental gases, such as: carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), volatile organic compounds (VOC), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2); as well as the possibility to interface with other systems for common gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxygen (O2) before developed. Other environmental measures such as speed and wind direction, temperature and relative humidity, may also be included. In this case, a configurable platform based on mixed-signal circuits, PSoC5, was used for the development of embedded system. This platform can be interfaced with different Arduino shields and achieves the integration of several analog functions. This system manages, acquires and processes signals from the above transducers. The measurements can be displayed on an LCD display, save into an SD memory and send to the Web using Ethernet interface. The device is hand size, easy to carry and can operate with a battery. Its user interface is simple and provides updated and in-situ readings. Currently, successful results have been obtained from the functional and metrology testing of the manufactured prototype. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Understanding basics concepts of electronics and computer programming allows researchers in microfabrication to get the most out of the equipment in their laboratories. However, this subject is not normally included in the college chemistry curricula. To introduce concepts of hardware and software, this work focused on the design and use of a simple PDMS/glass microdevice controlled by a low-cost microcontroler (Teensy) and open-source software (Arduino). Furthermore, a practical demonstration of the utility of this system for microscale chemical sample handling and analysis was performing by on chip acid-base titration, followed by conductivity detection with an open-source low-cost detection system. Overall, the system provided a very reproducible (98%) platform to perform fluid delivery at the microfluidic scale. © 14CBMS.

AB  - Two prominent social progressive movements are faced with a few contradictions and a paradox. On the one side, we have a re-emergence of the co-operative movement and worker-owned enterprises which suffer from certain structural weaknesses. On the other, we have an emergent field of open and Commons-oriented peer production initiatives which create common pools of knowledge for the whole of humanity, but are dominated by start-ups and large multinational enterprises using the same Commons. Thus we have a paradox: the more communist the sharing license used in the peer production of free software or open hardware, the more capitalist the practice. To tackle this paradox and the aforementioned contradictions, we tentatively suggest a new convergence that would combine both Commons-oriented open peer production models with common ownership and governance models, such as those of the co-operatives and the solidarity economic models.

AB  - A mobile and modular educational robotic platform called "Yrobot" is presented for the purpose of increasing students interest in studying technical subjects, to support teaching and to promote the selected areas of the information and communication technologies. The developed mobile robotic system is open hardware. Its base part - a mobile robotic platform - is being continuously extended by expansion modules to enable the development and implementation of the specific applications. As the first expansion module for the "Yrobot", an audio-communication subsystem module based on Texas Instruments solutions has been developed. This extension module is called "AudioCom" and allows the development and verification of the simple modulation techniques operation. These techniques are commonly used in the radio frequency communication as well. This paper describes the motivation for the development of the mentioned platform, the expansion module circuit design, software solution and the experimental testing results. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents an open embedded hardware and software architecture for industrial robot control applied to visual servoing system. This architecture is a hardware and software co-design where embedded processors drive the FPGA for motor control. It is robot type independent, as long as the motors are equipped with incremental position encoders and driven by PWM signals. Low cost, low power consumption, high stability, flexibility and expandability are the key advantages. The architecture and related IP cores are developed through a component-based design model which interprets a mechatronic system by computation, communication, configuration and coordination components, together with composition of these components and blackboxes. The motor controller IP core is provided in the consistency of open hardware. Open software implies the use of OROCOS (Bruyninckx, 2001). The performance of visual servoing behaviour is evaluated by visual coupling of a Performer MK2 robot and a KUKA lightweight robot. Copyright © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - The development of a mobile hops harvester is used as a case study to explore trends toward increased open source equipment development. Theory of intrinsic and extrinsic motivators of innovation are explored alongside current understanding of incentives for participation in open source design practices. Incentives for open source participation are varied and participants in a single product development project may come to the project for very different reasons. The concept of a "design-use community" is introduced as a way of articulating and emphasizing the blurred line between innovation and adoption in the agricultural technology community which the open source movement has highlighted. The authors provide observations of open source modalities in use through a case study of the mobile hops harvester which provides a specific example of when an open source design approach can be successful in developing new agricultural equipment. The harvester has a demonstrated capacity of 120 bines per hour compared to 1 bine per hour per person for manual picking. This rate enables the harvest of a 1 acre yard within 8 hours resulting in optimal harvest timing and improved quality. Assuming a harvest team of 4 people in either case, this translates to a harvest labor cost savings of 97% or $3,120 per acre at $15 per hour wage (approximately $2 per lb of dried hops (10-20% of retail price)).

AB  - There have been several exciting developments in the technologies commonly used n in the hardware hacking community. Advances in low cost additive-manufacturing processes (i.e. 3D-printers) and the development of openhardware projects, which have produced inexpensive and easily programmable micro-controllers and micro-computers (i.e. Arduino and Raspberry Pi) have opened a new door for individuals seeking to make their own devices. Here we describe the potential for these technologies to reduce costs in construction and development of submillimeter/millimeter astronomical instrumentation. Specifically we have begun a program to measure the optical properties of the custom plastics used in 3D-printers as well as the printer accuracy and resolution to assess the feasibility of directly printing sub-/millimeter transmissive optics. We will also discuss low cost designs for cryogenic temperature measurement and control utilizing Arduino and Raspberry Pi. © 2014 SPIE.

AB  - This paper presents some findings related to the experience of developing and deploying an software application aimed at using remote experimentation with mobile devices and the use of Virtual Learning Environments (VLE) as tools to support teaching and learning. Currently the technological resources have been misused in education, and the potential use of mobile devices in education is virtually untapped. The architecture implemented enables the users to control real experiments and to monitor results via video streaming, which provides a sense of involvement similar to hands-on laboratories. The authors describe the deployment of this mobile learning tool in a second year Brazilian public high school. The mobile application uses HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery Mobile in order to maintain compatibility among the platforms widely used. The VLE Moodle has been used in order to provide homework, assignments and teaching material. The experiments have been automated using open hardware and software sources, which facilitate replication in different areas. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Multi-ported RAMs are essential for high-performance parallel computation systems. VLIW and vector processors, CGRAs, DSPs, CMPs and other processing systems often rely upon multi-ported memories for parallel access, hence higher performance. Although memories with a large number of read and write ports are important, their high implementation cost means they are used sparingly in designs. As a result, FPGA vendors only provide dual-ported block RAMs to handle the majority of usage patterns. In this paper, a novel and modular approach is proposed to construct multi-ported memories out of basic dual-ported RAM blocks. Like other multi-ported RAM designs, each write port uses a different RAM bank and each read port uses bank replication. The main contribution of this work is an optimization that merges the previous live-value-table (LVT) and XOR approaches into a common design that uses a generalized, simpler structure we call an invalidation-based live-value-table (ILVT). Like a regular LVT, the I-LVT determines the correct bank to read from, but it differs in how updates to the table are made; the LVT approach requires multiple write ports, often leading to an areaintensive register-based implementation, while the XOR approach uses wider memories to accommodate the XOR-ed data and suffers from lower clock speeds. Two specific I-LVT implementations are proposed and evaluated, binary and one-hot coding. The I-LVT approach is especially suitable for larger multi-ported RAMs because the table is implemented only in SRAM cells. The I-LVT method gives higher performance while occupying less block RAMs than earlier approaches: for several configurations, the suggested method reduces the block RAM usage by over 44% and improves clock speed by over 76%. To assist others, we are releasing our fully parameterized Verilog implementation as an open source hardware library. The library has been extensively tested using ModelSim and Altera's Quartus tools.

AB  - The idea is to develop new RFID smart tag sensors to be used in a monitoring service assisted by ICT platform to monitor fresh produce quality. It is based on a smart gas sensor and consists of a commercial fork of open hardware, on which we assembly an array of commercial sensors suitable for air quality monitoring. In particular, to measure ethylene (ripening marker) a class of unspecific metal oxide commercial sensors has been selected and tested, in controlled environment, to probe the response capability to extremely low gas concentration (less than tens ppm). Firmware implemented uses a power management strategy to minimize device consumption. It is able to save locally raw data and transmit, on request, an index correlated to the vegetable ripening. The index results from a mathematical model based on time-integral function depending on the vegetable transport parameters, temperature, humidity and gas sensor outputs. Work in progress deals to optimize the algorithm and mathematical model implemented in device with Onsite experimentation. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - This chapter illustrates how to set up an inexpensive but effective Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) platform for the test of wind turbine (WT) controllers. The dynamics of the WT are simulated on the open-source National Renewable Energy Laboratory WT simulator called FAST (Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structures, and Turbulence), which emulates all required input signals of the controller and reacts to the controller commands (almost) like an onshore real turbine of 5 MW. The dynamic torque control system runs on an open hardware Arduino microcontroller board, which is connected to the virtual WT via USB. In particular, the power generation control in the full load region for variable-speed variable-pitch wind turbines is considered through torque and pitch control. The HIL proposed platform is used to characterize the behavior of the WT in normal operation as well as in fault operation. In particular, a stuck/unstuck fault is modeled and the behavior of a proposed chattering torque controller is analyzed in comparison to a baseline torque controller. © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - This paper proposes a simple Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)-based air quality monitoring system (WSN-AQMS) for industrial and urban areas. The proposed framework comprises a set of gas sensors (ozone, CO, and NO2) that are deployed on stacks and infrastructure of a Zigbee WSN and a central server to support both short-term real-time incident management and a long-term strategic planning. This architecture would use open-hardware open-software gas sensing capable motes [6] made by Libelium. These motes use the ZigBee communication protocol and provide a real-time low cost monitoring system through the use of low cost, low data rate, and low power wireless communication technology. The proposed monitoring system can be transferred to or shared by other applications. We also introduce a simple but efficient clustering protocol dubbed hereafter "Clustering Protocol for Air Sensor network" (CPAS) for the proposed WSN-AQMS framework. CPAS proves to be efficient in terms of network energy consumption, network lifetime, and the rate at which data is communicated. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Understanding basic concepts of electronics and computer programming allows researchers to get the most out of the equipment found in their laboratories. Although a number of platforms have been specifically designed for the general public and are supported by a vast array of on-line tutorials, this subject is not normally included in university chemistry curricula. Aiming to provide the basic concepts of hardware and software, this article is focused on the design and use of a simple module to control a series of PDMS-based valves. The module is based on a low-cost microprocessor (Teensy) and open-source software (Arduino). The microvalves were fabricated using thin sheets of PDMS and patterned using CO2 laser engraving, providing a simple and efficient way to fabricate devices without the traditional photolithographic process or facilities. Synchronization of valve control enabled the development of two simple devices to perform injection (1.6 ± 0.4 μL/stroke) and mixing of different solutions. Furthermore, a practical demonstration of the utility of this system for microscale chemical sample handling and analysis was achieved performing an on-chip acid-base titration, followed by conductivity detection with an open-source low-cost detection system. Overall, the system provided a very reproducible (98%) platform to perform fluid delivery at the microfluidic scale. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulation is a technique used extensively in the development and testing of complex real-time embedded systems. Most of the HILs built around the world focus on specific part of a vehicle. This paper describes an in house HIL system developed for the complete hybrid car. In this HIL, the focus was to have HIL based on open hardware which is low cost and modular. It is customizable as per complex interdisciplinary vehicle requirements from Original Equipment Manufacturer that reduces dependency on suppliers and allows testing in an integrated vehicle environment. Code for operating HIL is developed in house. This HIL allows engineers to access ECU and plant model simultaneously and generate test report automatically. It consists of a vehicle plant model developed using MathWorks® Tool chain-MATLAB and Simulink. FPGA Plugin consist of software implementation of vehicle sensors in LabVIEW™ software from National Instruments (NI). NI VeriStand™ provides interface between LabVIEW code and plant model. Each release of vendors' software and functional safety checked in HIL, in an integrated and automated manner, before releasing to production line. This reduces bugs in field and eventually saves money and time to market. Because of early algorithm proving in vehicle development lifecycle, time and resources are saved. HIL has reduced tedious and cumbersome ECU testing on physical vehicle. Functional safety and performance related test cases have been prepared and executed to check redundant safety and fail safe functionality in ECUs, required to meet ISO 26262 standard.

AB  - Gyrotrons are widely used in Electron-Cyclotron Heating systems (ECH) to heat electrons in plasmas. Modern gyrotrons require a precise magnetic field for proper operation which is supplied by an electromagnet with multiple windings. The current for the electromagnet is provided by multiple high-current power supplies. The loss of any one of the power supplies during operation can cause significant and expensive damage to the gyrotron. An independent power supply monitoring system can prevent damage should a magnet power supply fail. This paper presents a magnet current monitor system capable of measuring and monitoring five magnet currents simultaneously. It provides limit tests, an interlock output for power supply failures and a status display for the operator. A self-test feature is included and the measurements and status can be examined through an Ethernet connection. The rapid advance of inexpensive microcontroller technology has led to the development of small microcontroller platforms and associated code libraries that have dramatically decreased the costs and development time required for such projects. This paper describes the use of a popular open-source software, open-hardware platform for the design and fabrication of the magnet current monitor. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Although the environmental benefits of recycling plastics are well established and most geographic locations within the U.S. offer some plastic recycling, recycling rates are often low. Low recycling rates are often observed in conventional centralized recycling plants due to the challenge of collection and transportation for high-volume low-weight polymers. The recycling rates decline further when low population density, rural and relatively isolated communities are investigated because of the distance to recycling centers makes recycling difficult and both economically and energetically inefficient. The recent development of a class of open source hardware tools (e.g. RecycleBots) able to convert post-consumer plastic waste to polymer filament for 3-D printing offer a means to increase recycling rates by enabling distributed recycling. In addition, to reducing the amount of plastic disposed of in landfills, distributed recycling may also provide low-income families a means to supplement their income with domestic production of small plastic goods. This study investigates the environmental impacts of polymer recycling. A life-cycle analysis (LCA) for centralized plastic recycling is compared to the implementation of distributed recycling in rural areas. Environmental impact of both recycling scenarios is quantified in terms of energy use per unit mass of recycled plastic. A sensitivity analysis is used to determine the environmental impacts of both systems as a function of distance to recycling centers. The results of this LCA study indicate that distributed recycling of HDPE for rural regions is energetically favorable to either using virgin resin or conventional recycling processes. This study indicates that the technical progress in solar photovoltaic devices, open-source 3-D printing and polymer filament extrusion have made distributed polymer recycling and upcycling technically viable. © 2013 Materials Research Society.

AB  - In this paper a new control-interface card for developing simple control loops and generating test signals for power electronic converters is presented. The control board can operate with two computational cores (Texas Instruments and Microchip) allowing using the preferred DSP architecture and development environment. Moreover, the interface board can operate with open hardware Arduino-like boards such as the ChipKit Uno32. The paper also describes how to enhance the performance of a ChipKit Uno32 with a dsPIC obtaining a more suitable solution for power electronics. The basic blocks and interfaces of the boards are presented in detail as well as the board main specifications. The board operation has been tested with three core platforms: TI Piccolo controlSTICK, a Microchip dsPIC and a ChipKit Uno32 (Arduino-like platform). The board was used for generating test signals for characterizing 1200 V Si and SiC power semiconductors. A 6 kW dc-dc converter prototype is presented; the converter is based on the developed interface board. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - With the recent development of the RepRap, an open-source self-replicating rapid prototyper, low-cost three-dimensional (3D) printing is now a technically viable form of distributed manufacturing of polymer-based products. However, the aggregate environmental benefits of distributed manufacturing are not clear due to scale reductions and the potential for increases in embodied energy. To quantify the environmental impact of distributed manufacturing using 3D printers, a life cycle analysis was performed on three plastic products. The embodied energy and emissions from conventional large-scale production in low-labor cost countries and shipping are compared to experimental measurements on a RepRap with and without solar photovoltaic (PV) power fabricating products with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA). The results indicate that the cumulative energy demand of manufacturing polymer products can be reduced by 41-64% (55-74% with PV) and concomitant emission reductions using distributed manufacturing with existing low-cost open-source 3D printers when using <25% fill PLA. Less pronounced positive environmental results are observed with ABS, which demands higher temperatures for the print bed and extruder. Overall, the results indicate that distributed manufacturing using open-source 3D printers has the potential to have a lower environmental impact than conventional manufacturing for a variety of products. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - 3D technologies are ubiquitous in all domains of science and technology, ranging from the most simple product development, optimization and production to the more complex like aerospace industry. In a wide definition 3D technologies can be classified into virtual and physical. The virtual ones can provide computational models for many types of representation, simulation, optimization and scientific visualization. The physical 3D technologies are responsible to realize virtual models into real objects. When using a layer-by-layer deposition of material to build objects it is known as 3D printing or more technically additive manufacturing. This article presents an overview of the 3D technologies and the new paradigm for open hardware and software as well design exchange as a new digital ecosystem that will strongly impact economy the next decades. It is also discussed three strategic programs and a community for medical imaging based on free software developed at CTI. © 2013 ACM.

AB  - We report on the design and installation of a spectrometer system for monitoring solar radiation in Cochabamba, Bolivia. Both the light intensity and the spectral distribution affect the power produced by a photovoltaic device. Local variations in the solar spectrum (especially compared to the AM1.5 standard) may have important implications for device optimization and energy yield estimation. The spectrometer system, based on an Ocean Optics USB4000 (300-900nm) spectrometer, was designed to increase functionality. Typically systems only record the global horizontal radiation. Our system moves a fiber-optic cable 0-90 degrees and takes measurements in 9 degree increments. Additionally, a shadow band allows measurement of the diffuse component of the radiation at each position. The electronic controls utilize an Arduino UNO microcontroller to synchronizes the movement of two PAP bipolar (stepper) motors with the activation of the spectrometer via an external trigger. The spectrometer was factory calibrated for wavelength and calibrated for absolute irradiance using a Sellarnet SL1-Cal light source. We present preliminary results from data taken March-June, 2013, and comment on implications for PV devices in Cochabamba. © 2013 SPIE.

AB  - CERN's accelerator control group has embraced ''Open Hardware'' (OH) to facilitate peer review, avoid vendor lock-in and make support tasks scalable. A web-based tool for easing collaborative work was set up and the CERN OH Licence was created. New ADC, TDC, fine delay and carrier cards based on VITA and PCI-SIG standards were designed and drivers for Linux were written. Often industry was paid for developments, while quality and documentation was controlled by CERN. An innovative timing network was also developed with the OH paradigm. Industry now sells and supports these designs that find their way into new fields.© CERN 2013.

AB  - The goal of the project was to investigate the flight behavior of a futuristic blended wing body concept in high altitudes. The shape to be tested was based on cooperation with its Swiss inventor Koni Schafroth from Team Smartfish [1]. The overall motivation for the project is the search for new reentry technologies. VEXREDUS stands for "Vehicle with Extended REentry Duration - University of Stuttgart", referring to reentry vehicles with a high Lift to Drag ratio. The project work involved the following tasks: • CNC/CAM based mold construction • Building of airframe in CFRP/GFRP sandwich technology • Development of own autopilot software on existing open source hardware • Implementation of own telemetry protocol • Development of a ground station • Development of a Redundant power supply • Development of a parachute system • Thermal and vacuum testing As a BEXUS team we were part of two launch campaigns at the ESRANGE facility in Northern Sweden. Though we had our share of setbacks, we were able to demonstrate the airframe's excellent flying characteristics and suitability for high altitude missions. The paper shall take a look at the technical challenges we've been facing and the investigations we made to learn more about the things that didn't work as expected, as well as the results drawn from the whole experiment.

AB  - Currently, a very important issue around the world is to track traffic violations and the resulting accidents, particularly in the railways sector. It is felt that this issue will be under control if somebody could properly monitor/track the individual trains. But this is not possible by individuals manually and so tracking of trains using a special device integrated in the train seems to be a possibility. This integrated device would then warn the train driver to drive safely and also enable periodically updating its location status in a remote controller. In this paper we propose such a real time train tracking system using the global positioning system (GPS) and communication of information through Ethernet Concepts. The system proposed enables communicating the real time information about the train position and also its health conditions based on few sensors attached/integrated. The proposed system would also provide with the complete information about the different trains running, in the video terminal of the controller, using the available internet facilities and the Google mapping Concepts. This proposed system uses a Arduino - A Electronic open Source hardware which provides the complete computation capability for this work. It is felt that this proposed system would provide a solution for a big organization like Indian railways to enable monitoring all their train movements in one place by using internet or through various LAN networks. The locations/positions of all individual vehicles are mapped using their IP addresses, in the Google map wherein each point in the Google map plotted provides the current information about the trains and also the Drivers Alcohol status, max speed, GPS Co-ordinates etc. The design details are provided in the paper. ©2013 IEEE.

AB  - Since its inception in 19th-century Germany, the physiology laboratory has been a complex and expensive research enterprise involving experts in various fields of science and engineering. Physiology research has been critically dependent on cutting-edge technological support of mechanical, electrical, optical, and more recently computer engineers. Evolution of modern experimental equipment is constrained by lack of direct communication between the physiological community and industry producing this equipment. Fortunately, recent advances in open source technologies, including three-dimensional printing, open source hardware and software, present an exciting opportunity to bring the design and development of research instrumentation to the end user, i.e., life scientists. Here we provide an overview on how to develop customized, cost-effective experimental equipment for physiology laboratories. © 2013 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - Access to a prototype during R&D can play a crucial role in early identification of the weaknesses in the design. Under circumstances that a particular commercial subsystem with the exact required specific features is unavailable, the realization of such a prototype can be delayed. In this paper, an example of rapid prototyping for a dual-channel biosignal data acquisition system based on the open-source concept is described. The selected biosignal is the finger photoplethysmogram. Except for Matlab, all other software components are open-source. The hardware design of the optical sensor utilized to record the signals is also open-source, making the system extremely affordable with the advantage of flexibility and customization. Precise timing of the samples allows for proper alignment and delay estimation between the acquired traces, useful in arterial stiffness studies. Although the results presented concern only two channels, the system has the ability to be expanded to six channels. Further possible expansions include the addition of custom filtering, on-board data compression and advanced GUI. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Liquid levels are measured in a variety of agricultural applications, and are often measured manually, which can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. Rapid advances in electronic technologies have made a variety of inexpensive sensing, monitoring, and control capabilities available. A monitoring system was developed and evaluated for automatic measurement of liquid levels, and demonstrated by monitoring water levels in evaporation pans used in evaporation studies and irrigation scheduling. The system is composed of an ultrasonic sensor, a microcontroller-based data logger, and a temperature sensor. The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance from the sensor to the liquid surface. Air temperature is measured by the temperature sensor, and is used to compensate for changes in the speed of sound due to air-temperature variations to improve accuracy of ultrasonic distance measurements. The datalogger is programmed to take measurements and to store data on a memory card which can be downloaded for processing and analysis. All components of the system were assembled in a PVC housing. The system was tested in the field, and resulted in water levels measured by the system corresponding very closely to those measured manually (R2 &gt; 0.98). This system is inexpensive, with total cost of US$85, and easy to build, install, and maintain. In addition to monitoring liquid levels, the system could be adapted to a variety of other measurements.

AB  - This article examines the open paradigm in design research and introduces a new conceptualization for 'open design' and a three-layer framework to demonstrate the degrees of openness in design practices. The conceptualization comprises all stages in the design process, ranging from need-finding to the openness of the design documents and the data gathered during the design process, and the commercialization of the end-product. The aspects of the product and the process merge in this framework, intertwining the aspects of technical, legal and commercial openness. Finally, the article proposes a research agenda for open design. The article builds on an extensive literature review about studies on 'open' in design: open-source software, open hardware, and participatory methods in design, such as co-design and participatory design, and user-engagement methods such as crowdsourcing and co-creation.

AB  - TV White Spaces (TVWS) technology and regulation has the potential to make connectivity both technically and economically feasible in rural Africa where affordable access remains a challenge. The superior propagation characteristics of TVWS technology make it particularly well suited to connecting remote communities. Evidence collected from our measurements in Malawi and Zambia suggest that most UHF spectrum is already available both in urban as well as in rural areas and could be used to provide Internet connectivity. In this paper we present the findings of a TVWS spectrum measurement initiative in Malawi and Zambia. We introduce an open hardware device that geo-tags spectrum measurements and saves the results on a micro SD card. The device can also be used to record the use of spectrum over long periods of time.

AB  - One of the major obstacles in the study of HRI (human-robot interaction) with social robots is the lack of multiple identical robots that allow testing with large user groups. Often, the price of these robots prohibits using more than a handful. A lot of the commercial robots do not possess all the necessary features to perform specific HRI experiments and due to the closed nature of the platform, large modifications are nearly impossible. While open source social robots do exist, they often use high-end components and expensive manufacturing techniques, making them unsuitable for easy reproduction. To address this problem, a new social robotics platform, named Ono, was developed. The design is based on the DIY mindset of the maker movement, using off-the-shelf components and more accessible rapid prototyping and manufacturing techniques. The modular structure of the robot makes it easy to adapt to the needs of the experiment and by embracing the open source mentality, the robot can be easily reproduced or further developed by a community of users. The low cost, open nature and DIY friendliness of the robot make it an ideal candidate for HRI studies that require a large user group. © Springer International Publishing 2013.

AB  - A TPad Tablet is a tablet computer with a variable friction touchscreen. It can create the perception of force, shape, and texture on a fingertip, enabling unique and novel haptic interactions on a flat touchscreen surface. We have created an affordable and easy to use variable friction device and have made it available through the open-hardware TPad Tablet Project. We present this device as a potential research platform as well as demonstrate two applications: remote touch communication and rapid haptic sketching. © 2013 Authors.

AB  - Robust velocity and position estimation at high update rates is crucial for mobile robot navigation. In recent years optical flow sensors based on computer mouse hardware chips have been shown to perform well on micro air vehicles. Since they require more light than present in typical indoor and outdoor low-light conditions, their practical use is limited. We present an open source and open hardware design 1 of an optical flow sensor based on a machine vision CMOS image sensor for indoor and outdoor applications with very high light sensitivity. Optical flow is estimated on an ARM Cortex M4 microcontroller in real-time at 250 Hz update rate. Angular rate compensation with a gyroscope and distance scaling using a ultrasonic sensor are performed onboard. The system is designed for further extension and adaption and shown in-flight on a micro air vehicle. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The teaching of programming skills to young students is often described by those educators involved as problematic at best. Student issues like mathematical maturity, readiness for complex thought, basic problem solving skills, short attention span especially related to the boredom of traditional programming teaching methodologies, and the lack of exciting problems and their solutions with respect to programming assignments contribute to the angst of many a programming instructor. A small fraction of students who "were just made for programming" always seem to succeed at whatever programming problem is given to them. However, a majority of students, especially precollege and college freshmen tend to have difficulty in overcoming these issues. It is with that observation that something new, in terms of programming pedagogy, needed to be investigated by this paper's authors. An ideal opportunity requiring successful programming instruction for 7-12 graders in the local metropolitan area presented itself in the winter of 2012. The students were involved in a statewide competition where groups of students self-selected into project options offered by various sponsoring institutions. Under the "Technology" choice heading of the state program, the student team and the instructor agreed to program a microprocessor to send messages in International Morse Code. The object of the exercise was to learn basic programming skills and to apply them to solving a problem. The hook was to do something brand new the students had never engaged in, keeping their attention on the end goal, and to see the immediate real-time results of some programming effort along the development cycle as the completed final program took form. The effort was a resounding success; the students learned in a few Saturday morning sessions more about programming than the authors have experienced over weeks of effort in traditional programming classes at the college freshman level. © 2013 ACM.

AB  - This paper describes the use of the open source hardware platform, denominated "Arduino", for controlling solenoid valves for solutions handling in flow analysis systems. System assessment was carried out by spectrophotometric determination of iron (II) in natural water. The sampling rate was estimated as 45 determinations per hour and the coefficient of variation was lower than 3%. Per determination, 208 μg of 1-10-phenanthroline and ascorbic acid were consumed, generating 1.3 mL of waste. "Arduino" proved a reliable microcontroller with low cost and simple interfacing, allowing USB communication for solenoid device switching in flow systems.

AB  - A cryptographically secure hardware HTTP enabled random number generator based on a nondeterministic entropy source has been implemented using open source hardware development kit. Internally, randomness is distilled from the entropy source using Algorithm M where modified-RC4-based and BLAKE-512-as-counter-mode pseudo-random number stream generators are combined. Users access the device via HTTP on a TCP/IP network and platform specific device drivers are not required. The random number files were tested using stringent statistical tests including DIEHARD, STS 2.1.1, dieharder 3.31.1, TestU01 1.2.3 SmallCrush and ENT. Emphasis was put on low cost of hardware. © 2013 MIPRO.

AB  - An outstanding issue in graph-theoretical studies of brain functional connectivity is the lack of formal criteria for choosing parcellation granularity and correlation threshold. Here, we propose detectability of scale-freeness as a benchmark to evaluate time-series extraction settings. Scale-freeness, i.e., power-law distribution of node connections, is a fundamental topological property that is highly conserved across biological networks, and as such needs to be manifest within plausible reconstructions of brain connectivity. We demonstrate that scale-free network topology only emerges when adequately fine cortical parcellations are adopted alongside an appropriate correlation threshold, and provide the full design of the first open-source hardware platform to accelerate the calculation of large linear regression arrays. © 2013 IPEM.

AB  - Paparazzi is a free and open-source hardware and software project intended to create a flexible autopilot system for fixed-wing aircraft as well as multicopters by allowing and encouraging input from the community. In addition to the airborne hardware and software (from voltage regulators, IMU boards and GPS receivers to Kalman filtering code), the project includes an ever-expanding array of ground hardware and software including modems, antennas and a user-friendly ground control software interface with a simulation environment. The airborne software supports several microprocessor architectures and various hardware configurations. All hardware and software is open-source and freely available to anyone under the GNU licensing agreement. Currently, the Paparazzi project is developed mainly at ENAC University (Ecole Nationale de l'Aviation Civile) and the TU-Delft, but significant amount of work done by various open-source enthusiasts. The system has been used on dozens of airframes and implemented by several teams around the world. Thousands of hours of autonomous flight have been successfully achieved with the Paparazzi system on all continents including the Antarctic. © 2013 AACC American Automatic Control Council.

AB  - Statistical simulation based design error debug approaches strongly rely on quality of the diagnostic test. At the same time there exists no dedicated technique to perform its quality assessment and engineers are forced to rely on subjective figures such as verification test quality metrics or just the size of the diagnostic test. This paper has proposed two new approaches for assessing diagnostic capability of diagnostic tests for automated bug localization. The first approach relies on probabilistic simulation of diagnostic experiments. The second assessment method is based on calculating Hamming distances of the individual sub-tests in the diagnostic test set. The methods are computationally cheap and they provide for a measure of confidence in the localization results and allow estimating impact of the diagnostic test enhancement. The approach is implemented as a part of an open-source hardware design and debugging framework zamiaCAD. Experimental results with an industrial processor design and a set of documented bugs demonstrate feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Ethernet is widely recognized as an attractive networking technology for modern distributed real-time systems. However, standard Ethernet components require specific modifications and hardware support to provide strict latency guarantees necessary for safety-critical applications. Although this is a well-stated fact, the design of hardware components for real-time communication remains mostly unexplored. This becomes evident from the few solutions reporting prototypes and experimental validation, which hinders the consolidation of Ethernet in real-world distributed applications. This paper presents Atacama, the first open-source framework based on reconfigurable hardware for mixed-criticality communication in multi-segmented Ethernet networks. Atacama uses specialized modules for time-triggered communication of real-time data, which seamlessly integrate with a standard infrastructure using regular best-effort traffic. Atacama enables low and highly predictable communication latency on multi-segmented 1Gbps networks, easy optimization of devices for specific application scenarios, and rapid prototyping of new protocol characteristics. Researchers can use the open-source design to verify our results and build upon the framework, which aims to accelerate the development, validation, and adoption of Ethernet-based solutions in real-time applications. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The rapid detection and identification of infectious disease pathogens is a critical need for healthcare in both developed and developing countries. As we gain more insight into the genomic basis of pathogen infectivity and drug resistance, point-of-care nucleic acid testing will likely become an important tool for global health. In this paper, we present an inexpensive, handheld, battery-powered instrument designed to enable pathogen genotyping in the developing world. Our Microfluidic Biomolecular Amplification Reader (μBAR) represents the convergence of molecular biology, microfluidics, optics, and electronics technology. The μBAR is capable of carrying out isothermal nucleic acid amplification assays with real-time fluorescence readout at a fraction of the cost of conventional benchtop thermocyclers. Additionally, the μBAR features cell phone data connectivity and GPS sample geotagging which can enable epidemiological surveying and remote healthcare delivery. The μBAR controls assay temperature through an integrated resistive heater and monitors real-time fluorescence signals from 60 individual reaction chambers using LEDs and phototransistors. Assays are carried out on PDMS disposable microfluidic cartridges which require no external power for sample loading. We characterize the fluorescence detection limits, heater uniformity, and battery life of the instrument. As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrate the detection of the HIV-1 integrase gene with the μBAR using the Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) assay. Although we focus on the detection of purified DNA here, LAMP has previously been demonstrated with a range of clinical samples, and our eventual goal is to develop a microfluidic device which includes on-chip sample preparation from raw samples. The μBAR is based entirely around open source hardware and software, and in the accompanying online supplement we present a full set of schematics, bill of materials, PCB layouts, CAD drawings, and source code for the μBAR instrument with the goal of spurring further innovation toward low-cost genetic diagnostics. © 2013 Myers et al.

AB  - The field of wireless communication has become the hottest area and Software Defined Radio (SDR) is revolutionizing it. By bringing much functionality as software, SDR reduces the cost of hardware maintenance and up-gradation. Open source hardware such as USRP (Universal Software Radio Peripheral) and software called GNU Radio-Companion are commonly used to do experiments in SDR. Since the cost of USRP is high, a low cost set up is needed which is affordable by the student community. In this paper a low cost alternative to USRP is proposed using RTL-SDR (Realtek Software Defined Radio) which is only used for reception. For transmitting purpose, a mixer circuit can be used to map the baseband signal to the band that can be received by RTL-SDR on the other end on Linux / Windows platform. Initially, the experiment is done in simulation. After that, it is tested with low cost hardware such as mixer and RTL-SDR. The cost for total transceiver system can be less than USD 100 which is 10 times less than the existing one. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Nowadays, the bottleneck in network communications is not represented by the link capacity anymore, but by the receiver processing power. To face this problem, more and more offloading techniques have been developed and implemented in modern NICs, allowing the CPUs to offload some of the required processing onto the underlying hardware. In this work, we present an implementation on an open hardware platform of a stateless Large Receive Offload method (LRO). The presented results experimental demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed implementation. © 2013 ACM.

AB  - Smart energy monitoring has become an important engineering problem in the recent years. In this paper we presented a smart energy metering device built using popular Arduino microcontroller based open-source hardware and software platform. The energy meter keeps historical energy usage records and can display that with touch screen interface. Since the information is easily accessible, one can view the usage trends and changes energy usage patterns to save energy and money. Our approach of using an off-the-shelf hardware platform and related open source software tools for energy measurement can give important advantage to the power industry. Anyone interested in energy measurement may use our technique to build a smart energy meter. In this paper, we discussed detail design and implementation of an Arduino Mega 1280 microcontroller based electricity consumption meter that records present and past power consumptions on a micro SD card.

AB  - In this paper, a bistatic passive radar receiver system named "Coherent-scatter Atmospheric Passive Radar Imager (CAPRI)" is described. It is primarily designed to study the dynamics of the upper atmosphere by utilizing "transmitters of opportunity" as the RF target illuminators. CAPRI is constructed using the open source software-defined radio toolkit, GNU Radio, to meet the signal processing requirements in combination with the open source hardware, Universal Software Radio Peripheral 2, for data acquisition. The resultant system is highly flexible, and we present the details of the design as well as a performance analysis. CAPRI will be deployed in Peru, near the magnetic equator, for long-term operations in the area. FM stations near Lima, Peru, will be utilized with the targets of interest being the equatorial electrojet and the spread F. The results will then be compared to the Jicamarca Unattended Long-term investigations of the Ionosphere and Atmosphere (JULIA) radar data, and CAPRI will be used to improve the simultaneous time and spatial coverage in the region in a more cost-effective manner.

AB  - Early industrialism was influenced by the organization of cottage industries, and in a similar vein, many of today's creative industries emerge largely from networked small-scale initiatives or cultural scenes. Collaborations and interactions are the backbone of the contemporary Do-It-Yourself (DIY) or 'maker culture', a distributed milieu of open software programmers and hardware hackers, but also crafters, backyard tinkerers, hobbyists and homesteaders. The scene is held together by micro-management tactics, or 'molecular' management, using protocols to guide collaborative innovation and shared craft practices, forming an emergent and innovative creative cottage industry. The maker culture is thus less of a DIY and more a do-it-together culture, merging collaborative play and interactions, often for the sake of shared curiosity. The mindset of the participants is that of the explorative craftsman; using a practical attitude of sharing ideas, methods and skills among practitioners, and the interactions are managed in a flat and meshworked manner through the use of protocols. The text specifically examines the protocols of the maker movement, finding an immediate connection between hardware protocols, like the 'makers bill of rights' guiding the principles of open source hardware, and the principles reflected in the social protocols of two hacker spaces. The maker culture is not only a loose network of dispersed tinkerers, it is also a close-knit molecular assemblage of materials, tools, skills and makers. © 2012 Intellect Ltd Editorial.

AB  - The preliminary design for the Open Prototype for Educational NanoSats (OPEN) demonstration spacecraft, OpenOrbiter, is presented. OPEN is designed to facilitate the formation of CubeSat development programs nationally and worldwide via providing a publically-available set of spacecraft design documents, implementation and testing plans. These documents should allow the creation of a 1-U CubeSat with a parts budget of approximately $ 5,000. This allows spacecraft development to be incorporated in regular curriculum and supported from teaching (as opposed to research) funds. The OPEN design, implemented by OpenOrbiter, has an innovative internal structure, separates payload and operations processing and includes features to ease and highlight errors in integration. © 2013 by the authors.

AB  - The increasing pace of economic development and urbanization around the world has led to serious problems of environmental pollution, particularly from automobile emissions which contributes to Global Warming. In this paper, a low-cost mobile urban environmental monitoring system is proposed using off-the-shelf open source hardware and software. The system can be installed or used in public transport vehicles, particularly in school and college buses in countries like India. A pollution map of local and regional environments can be built from the data acquired, and displayed online leading to increased awareness of urban pollution problems. The system can also be used in situ in school and college buses to educate children and youth on emerging technologies like computer hardware, software, and web technologies. Results of prototype implementation are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the approach. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - This paper describes my doctoral research into the possibilities that digital fabrication offers for the individual design and production of electronic devices. Research questions relate to the possibilities for the devices themselves and their relationship to people's skills interests. The paper discusses four overall approaches: product design explorations, do-it-yourself activities, custom software tools, and studying communities. Three completed case studies - a radio, speakers, and a mouse - provide insight into the design possibilities and their implications for various groups. Future work will explore further aspects of this ecosystem, including more complex devices, more in-depth investigation of people, and community surveys. Copyright 2013 ACM.

AB  - We present the "Honeycomb", a microcontroller platform that can easily be networked into hexagonal lattices of hundreds of nodes to create novel materials that tightly integrate sensing, actuation, computation and communication. The tool-chain consists of the platforms, a viral boot-loader to virally disseminate programs into the network, a software library that facilitates sensing, control, and communication, and software tools that allow interacting with the network from a host computer. After a brief tutorial, participants will have an opportunity to experiment with the Honeycomb hardware, which will be made available during the studio, write code for distributed processing of sensor information, and drive various actuators ranging from multi-color lights to servo motors, with the goal to construct an interactive installation to be displayed at the conference. All materials, including open source hardware and software will be made available on the web prior to the studio. Copyright 2013 ACM.

AB  - TH-models is a design making toolkit for exploration of peer-to-peer objects using open hardware and lo-fi materials. A range of electronic objects has been designed that demonstrate the fabrication of prototype devices from available modules and tools, at an affordable price, and an accessible entry point. The designs are published online and made available for self-fabrication as well as demonstrated in workshops such as this. This studio will give participants from the TEI community a hands-on chance to construct an object of their own from a design template created especially for the studio, and to then build on it designing their own variations or customizing the given model. Lastly and most importantly they will be able to experience how these electronic objects can work together, and form expressions of networks. Copyright is held by the author/owner(s).

AB  - The high cost of what have historically been sophisticated research-related sensors and tools has limited their adoption to a relatively small group of well-funded researchers. This paper provides a methodology for applying an open-source approach to design and development of a colorimeter. A 3-D printable, open-source colorimeter utilizing only open-source hardware and software solutions and readily available discrete components is discussed and its performance compared to a commercial portable colorimeter. Performance is evaluated with commercial vials prepared for the closed reflux chemical oxygen demand (COD) method. This approach reduced the cost of reliable closed reflux COD by two orders of magnitude making it an economic alternative for the vast majority of potential users. The open-source colorimeter demonstrated good reproducibility and serves as a platform for further development and derivation of the design for other, similar purposes such as nephelometry. This approach promises unprecedented access to sophisticated instrumentation based on low-cost sensors by those most in need of it, under-developed and developing world laboratories. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Print management solutions are necessary for organizations that need to monitor, report and charge printing or photocopying usage, especially in large domains where business goals require streamlined procedures. High-end print management systems offer integrated credit reception and efficient, parametrized accounting for the use of resources. The usage of printers and photocopy machines is controlled and monitored, and, through the latter, waste elimination is achieved. Print management inherently conforms with the rationale and mentality of green and eco-friendly technologies that also relate with the ethos of the open source movement in IT. One would expect that open source print management solutions would thrive; however, the vast majority of integrated management systems are commercial. There is only a small number of valuable open source print accounting solutions, but there are none that integrate accounting with a form of credit reception. This paper presents the design of an open system that integrates the provision of automated credit reception with accounting services in order to produce an open solution that fully automates the business process of print charging. The objective is to design the necessary automations for credit reception so that it can be realized without any human intervention, to plan the integration with a suitable open print accounting system and to specify any complementary utilities and tools necessary for production installations. © 2007-2012 IEEE.

AB  - For many years robotics has been benefited from the open source community. Software community projects like Player, Stage, Gazebo, ROS, or OpenCV are present in most robotic applications. In recent years this trend has also been initiated among electronic and mechanical developments (open hardware). The Arduino development platform is a good example of a successful hardware project with a great community of developers and users around it. The apparition of personal 3D printers is bringing the open source philosophy to the fabrication of physical things as well. This new technology is in need of new designing tools to take advantage of it. In this paper we are presenting the C++ Object Oriented Mechanics Library (OOML), a tool to design mechanical components, taking into account the needs and requirements of these emerging technologies. These designs can be easily shared, reused, and modified. The OOML brings together the advantages of (1) modelling things through code, (2) the object oriented programming paradigm, and (3) the power of C++. In the OOML, mechanical parts are described as geometrical combinations of basic primitives. Once a part is defined, fabrication files can be generated in order to print, or mechanize it. Models could also be used for simulation, visualization, structural analysis, etc. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Just as the power of the open-source design paradigm has driven down the cost of software to the point that it is accessible to most people, the rise of open-source hardware is poised to drive down the cost of doing experimental science to expand access to everyone. To assist in this aim, this paper introduces a library of open-source 3-D-printable optics components. This library operates as a flexible, low-cost public-domain tool set for developing both research and teaching optics hardware. First, the use of parametric open-source designs using an open-source computer aided design package is described to customize the optics hardware for any application. Second, details are provided on the use of open-source 3-D printers (additive layer manufacturing) to fabricate the primary mechanical components, which are then combined to construct complex optics-related devices. Third, the use of the open-source electronics prototyping platform are illustrated as control for optical experimental apparatuses. This study demonstrates an open-source optical library, which significantly reduces the costs associated with much optical equipment, while also enabling relatively easily adapted customizable designs. The cost reductions in general are over 97%, with some components representing only 1% of the current commercial investment for optical products of similar function. The results of this study make its clear that this method of scientific hardware development enables a much broader audience to participate in optical experimentation both as research and teaching platforms than previous proprietary methods. © 2013 Zhang et al.

AB  - OpenPMU is an open platform for the development of phasor measurement unit (PMU) technology. A need has been identified for an open-source alternative to commercial PMU devices tailored to the needs of the university researcher and for enabling the development of new synchrophasor instruments from this foundation. OpenPMU achieves this through open-source hardware design specifications and software source code, allowing duplicates of the OpenPMU to be fabricated under open-source licenses. This paper presents the OpenPMU device based on the Labview development environment. The device is performance tested according to the IEEE C37.118.1 standard. Compatibility with the IEEE C37.118.2 messaging format is achieved through middleware which is readily adaptable to other PMU projects or applications. Improvements have been made to the original design to increase its flexibility. A new modularized architecture for the OpenPMU is presented using an open messaging format which the authors propose is adopted as a platform for PMU research. © 1963-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The ASDEX Upgrade tokamak went into operation in 1991 with a proposed lifetime of 10 years. Due to major modifications ASDEX Upgrade is still in operation. Infrastructure like data acquisition, workstations, etc. is being modernized, interfaces like RS-232 are vanishing and new interfaces are being introduced. This leads to the necessity to adapt old hardware. Most of the microcontrollers used in the old hardware do not offer any support of the new interfaces and have to be replaced. A simple and efficient way is to replace them with open hardware microcontroller boards like the Arduino. These boards are based on 8-bit RISC microcontrollers and offer a software development environment with a large number of libraries. In this paper the use of Arduino boards for replacing the position unit, the stub tuner interface and its use controlling a direct digital synthesizer (DDS) with phase control capability are shown. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Building a radiosonde with open hardware solutions engages engineering students in meteorological problems and allows them to develop new ideas about probing the atmosphere. The students have realized that the importance of the radiosonde as a tool for gathering meteorological data is enormous. The radiosonde allows measurement and transmission of data from regions mostly inaccessible to humans in a short period of time. Key advantages of the radiosonde over other observing systems are its relatively low cost, high accuracy, and high vertical resolution in situ vertical profiles of the atmosphere from the surface up to tens of kilometers. The existing radiosondes have evolved into a relatively standard and well-developed set of instruments that measure temperature, pressure, and humidity.

AB  - In this paper, we illustrate an open-source ready-to-use hardware/software architecture for a quadrotor UAV. The presented platform is price effective, highly customizable, and easily exploitable by other researchers involved in high-level UAV control tasks and for educational purposes as well. The use of object-oriented programming and full support of Robot Operating System (ROS) and Matlab Simulink allows for an efficient customization, code reuse, functionality expansion and rapid prototyping of new algorithms. We provide an extensive illustration of the various UAV components and a thorough description of the main basic algorithms and calibration procedures. Finally, we present some experimental case studies aimed at showing the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. © IFAC.

AB  - There have been several recent developments in Open Source Hardware that enable the creation of relatively low-cost sensors for remote deployment. The initial work done by ICFOSS for soil and atmosphere monitoring sensor networks, where the sensors had wired connections within each node, had limited their deployment to very short distances around the node. A hybrid approach using a mesh network consisting of 'motes'-based sensors is proposed in conjunction with the Raspberry Pi-based management layer to un-tether the sensors, leading to simplified field-based deployments. This approach enables multiple applications such as remote monitoring for disaster management, precision agriculture, wildlife monitoring or pollution monitoring in urban areas. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper we present an FPGA-based architecture to export flows in 10 Gbps networks, implemented on the NetFPGA-10G platform. Flow-based monitoring is a powerful methodology to analyze and detect network issues, such as congested links or DDoS attacks. Our design provides the following advantages: (i) The architecture allows processing 10 Gbps links without sampling, even for the highest packet rate of 14.88 Mpps (Million packets per second) that corresponds to the shortest (64-byte) Ethernet frames; (ii) It is possible to manage up to 786,432 concurrent flows; (iii) The project is developed in an open-source hardware platform and the HDL code is open to the community; (iv) The proposed approach frees network routers from the burden of exporting flows. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - A case study of hobbyists developing a desktop 3D printer, indicative of a broader movement around open hardware development, is used to advance a theoretical apparatus drawing on social movement research. This is proposed as an alternative to how innovation by users is typically studied in innovation studies literature, namely, as discrete, isolated cases. Open hardware development projects make up a larger ecology, held together by common ideas, a shared communication infrastructure, conferences and licenses, among other things, and it therefore makes sense to look at them as part of a single movement. © 2013, Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society.

AB  - Since its introduction in 1992, Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) has evolved to become a worldwide standard in mobile telephony. Security in GSM, albeit being one of the most important issues, has not yet been scrutinized to a level it deserves owing mainly to the expensive hardware requirements and lack of thorough understanding of GSM protocols in general. This scenario is changing significantly with the growing rate of development of open-source tools, which can serve to harness the RF signaling and enable processing on a general purpose workstation. In this paper, these open-source tools are utilized to study the feasibility of developing a GSM Protocol Analyzer and investigating the theoretical security protocols and procedures through practical implementation of such system. Universal Software Programmable Radio Peripheral (USRP) was selected as the RF frontend for the protocol analyzer. The USRP is a general purpose, open-hardware transceiver that can be linked to a workstation via an RJ45 Gigabit Ethernet link. Various open-source software, based primarily on GNU Radio, are then utilized to synchronize, demodulate and decode the received signal. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Utility companies around the world are replacing electro-mechanical power meters with new smart meters. These digital power meters have enhanced communication capabilities, but they are not actually smart. We present the cognitive power meter (c-meter), a meter that is actually smart. By using load disaggregation intelligence, c-meter is the realization of demand response and other smart grid energy conservation initiatives. Our c-meter is made of two key components: a prototype open source ammeter and an optimized embedded load disaggregation algorithm (μDisagg). Additionally, we provide an open source multi-circuit ammeter array that can build probabilistic appliance (or load) consumption models that are used by the c-meter. μDisagg is the first load disaggregation algorithm to be implemented on an inexpensive low-power embedded processor that runs in real-time using a typical/basic smart meter measurement (current, in A). μDisagg can disaggregate loads with complex power states with a high degree of accuracy. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Outdoor air pollution now contributes annually to over 3.2 million premature deaths worldwide and is among the top health risk factors. Urban air pollution is on course to become the top environmental cause of mortality by 2050 - greater than the effects of dirty water and lack of sanitation. This risk is especially high in developing countries, where it is often difficult or expensive to obtain air quality data. This paper outlines the initial development of a system for mapping crowd-sourced air quality data in urban environments in developing countries. This system includes a (1) low cost wearable air quality monitor and (2) a mapping and data visualization web application for use in urban settings in developing countries. Based on open source hardware and software, the air quality monitor is composed of an Arduino microcontroller and sensor shields and collects real-time geographically explicit air quality data, with data storage on removable memory. The mapping and data visualization web application uses javascript functions and Google Maps API to visualize the paths travelled and the intensity of ozone and particulate matter as a heat map. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The open hardware mobile manipulator (OHMM) is a new open platform with a unique combination of features for teaching robotics software and algorithms. On-board low-and high-level processors support real-time embedded programming and motor control, as well as higher-level coding with contemporary libraries. Full hardware designs and software source codes are available under free licenses enabling the community to adapt and update the design as the field (and available hardware) evolves. Digital manufacturing (3-D printing and laser cutting) methods, now available as low-cost Internet services, enable OHMM to be easily modified and to be built from scratch for a competitive price. Five hands-on curriculum modules are presented that use OHMM to teach robotics software and algorithms at the undergraduate and graduate levels, and results are presented based on student performance and feedback. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - The FireFader is a simple haptic force-feedback device that is optimized for introducing musicians to haptics. It is based upon a single-degree-of- freedom potentiometer fader coupled to a DC motor, also known as a "motorized fader." A light is connected in parallel with the motor to help communicate the force's strength visually. The FireFader consists of only open-source hardware and open-source software elements. Consequently, it is relatively easy for users to repurpose it into new projects involving varying kinds and numbers of motors and sensors. An open-source device driver for the FireFader allows it to be linked to a computer via USB so that the computer can perform the feedback control calculations. For example, the computer can simulate the acoustics of a virtual musical instrument to concurrently synthesize sound and calculate the motor force as a function of the fader position. The serial connection over USB increases the latency of the control signal compared to embedded implementations, but the serial connection facilitates easier programming via the computer, and the force feedback can be automatically disabled when the user is not touching the fader. Some new devices derived from the FireFader design are presented. © 2013 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

AB  - 3DP (Three Dimensional Printing) technology is one of the SFF (Solid Freeform Fabrication) technologies which have recently come into the spotlight due to its adaptability to various applications. However, commercial 3DP machines are limited as to the use of building material, without voiding the warranty on the machine. At the same time, a rise in domestic rapid prototyping machines is observed, but none of these machines use the 3DP process. Therefore, an open source 3DP machine is designed and built. In this study, the machine is discussed and the first experiments are carried out to create ceramic (alumina and zirconia) membranes with specific physical properties. The purpose for developing this machine was opening up the opportunity to investigate printing ceramic membranes and reactors. Were, contrary to many other applications, maximal compaction of the powder during deposition is not desirable, to maintain an open structure the walls of the printed object. The machine is able to deposit the powder with adjustable bulk density, which is used to alter the properties of the membrane. The design of the printer (drawings, electronic layout, software) is publicly released under an open source license, free for others to adapt, build and use, e.g. in academic research. © 2013 The Authors.

AB  - Since 2006, Synchrotron SOLEIL is producing photons. The beamlines became operational for the users in 2008. Until 2012, thanks to the excellent performances of the injection system of the storage ring, the perturbation on the position of the stored beam during Top-up injection was small enough to be accepted by the users. For some specific experiments requesting higher beam stability, few beamlines expressed their wish to be able to freeze the data acquisition during the injection. To fulfill this need, the diagnostics group of Synchrotron SOLEIL designed the "TimEX3" board which was integrated into the timing system in order to allow the gating of the Top-up injection. This design was released as open hardware. Towards this aim, we decided to design it with the open source and free EDA software "KiCad", and to make it available under the CERN's Open Hardware Repository. Copyright © 2013 by JACoW.

AB  - Technical progress in the open-source self replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) community has enabled a distributed form of additive manufacturing to expand rapidly using polymer-based materials. However, the lack of an open-source metal alternative and the high capital costs and slow throughput of proprietary commercialized metal 3-D printers has severely restricted their deployment. The applications of commercialized metal 3-D printers are limited to only rapid prototyping and expensive nished products. This severely restricts the access of the technology for small and medium enterprises, the developing world and for use in laboratories. This paper reports on the development of a 2000 open-source metal 3-D printer. The metal 3-D printer is controlled with an open-source micro-controller and is a combination of a low-cost commercial gas-metal arc welder and a derivative of the Rostock, a deltabot RepRap. The bill of materials, electrical and mechanical design schematics, and basic construction and operating procedures are provided. A preliminary technical analysis of the properties of the 3-D printer and the resultant steel products are performed. The results of printing customized functional metal parts are discussed and conclusions are drawn about the potential for the technology and the future work necessary for the mass distribution of this technology. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents a robust velocity estimation algorithm applicable to low-cost monocular platform with a tri-axial gyroscope. The algorithm is developed based on PX4FLOW platform which is an open software and open hardware solution for monocular speed estimation. The paper provides three main contributions. The first is the improved robustness achieved by various methods including feature block selection, feed-forward rotation, motion compensation, failure case detection and filtering. The second contribution is the improved performance in terms of resolution and search range achieved by adaptive frame interval and advanced search algorithm. The final contribution is a systematical strategy for parameter selection to fully utilize the hardware resources and optimize the performance in different contexts. The performance was benchmarked against the PX4FLOW and GPS. Results indicated that the proposed algorithm achieved levels of robustness exceeding that of PX4FLOW in measuring velocity. Also, the integrated trajectory agreed with the position calculated by an on-board GPS system. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The NASA Ames Research Center (NASA Ames) Center Chief Technologist (CCT) Office sponsors the Advanced Digital Materials and Manufacturing for Space (ADMMS) Initiative, which focuses on advanced manufacturing technologies for space, including identifying several target products, areas and applications, approaches for advanced manufacturing, mechanisms for collaboration, and complementary facilities. The pilot project for this initiative is the Multi-Purpose Avionics Core Element (M-PACE). The primary goal of M-PACE is to demonstrate advanced manufacturing techniques, such as additive manufacturing and Digital Materials, to minimize the cost of cube satellites and increase their modularity. M-PACE will be designed and built at the NASA Ames' SpaceShop, which is a state-of-the-art advanced manufacturing facility built for NASA researchers to formulate ideas for projects. The final products of M-PACE are several completed side panels of a one-unit (1U) (10 cm cube) cube satellite prototype built using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components, which will show the basic functionality of the internal payload by connecting it to the side panels for power and other subsystem capabilities. Within the structure, we are investigating the use of Digital Materials, which are universal building materials with the ability to increase precision and ease of assembly and disassembly of three dimensional (3D) objects. M-PACE will use COTS power systems and open-source hardware and software to distribute data through Ethernet through the use of snap-fit card connectors. Similar to Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) Express cards, we envision the spacecraft subsystems and payloads to be on a PC104-like board that will slide into the side panel connectors to enable distribution of power and data. This design has the potential to greatly reduce the cost of Cube Satellite testing and integration due to the absence of wires and ease of access to internal boards for any necessary modifications.

AB  - The recent development of open-source 3-D printers makes scaling of distributed additive-based manufacturing of high-value objects technically feasible and offers the potential for widespread proliferation of mechatronics education and participation. These self-replicating rapid prototypers (RepRaps) can manufacture approximately half of their own parts from sequential fused deposition of polymer feedstocks. RepRaps have been demonstrated for conventional prototyping and engineering, customizing scientific equipment, and appropriate technology-related manufacturing for sustainable development. However, in order for this technology to proliferate like 2-D electronic printers have, it must be economically viable for a typical household. This study reports on the life-cycle economic analysis (LCEA) of RepRap technology for an average US household. A new low-cost RepRap is described and the costs of materials and time to construct it are quantified. The economic costs of a selection of 20 open-source printable designs (representing less than 0.02% of those available), are typical of products that a household might purchase, are quantified for print time, energy, and filament consumption and compared to low and high Internet market prices for similar products without shipping costs. The results show that even making the extremely conservative assumption that the household would only use the printer to make the selected 20 products a year the avoided purchase cost savings would range from about $300 to $2000/year. Assuming the 25 h of necessary printing for the selected products is evenly distributed throughout the year these savings provide a simple payback time for the RepRap in 4 months to 2 years and provide an ROI between >200% and >40%. As both upgrades and the components that are most likely to wear out in the RepRap can be printed and thus the lifetime of the distributing manufacturing can be substantially increased the unavoidable conclusion from this study is that the RepRap is an economically attractive investment for the average US household already. It appears clear that as RepRaps improve in reliability, continue to decline in cost and both the number and assumed utility of open-source designs continues growing exponentially, open-source 3-D printers will become a mass-market mechatronic device. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Small satellite missions face two special challenges due to limited financial budgets. The first is tracking the satellite for orbit determination after orbit injection. The orbit can vary from the specified orbit when the satellite will be launched as secondary or parasitic payload. In case of unknown orbit parameters high-gain antennas can't be pointed towards the satellite and establish the first connection needed for satellite activation. The second challenge is to transmit all housekeeping and scientific data to mission operations via a limited number of ground-stations. The Distributed Ground Station Network (DGSN) solution can solve the problem with permanent tracking and a faster orbital element provision to the satellite owners. And it can provide permanent reception of satellite signals with its data-dump mode in between main ground-stations provided by the satellite owner. The key feature is the network of small ground-stations placed globally connected via the internet and performing an automatic scan of satellite (and other beacon) signals, storing and sending them back to a central server, where they can be accessed by the satellite owner. With a correlation of the beacon signal and GNSS synched ground-station time the satellite position is determined with pseudo-ranging trilateration. In contrast to ground-station time sharing concepts of Radio Aurora Explorer (SRI International in California and University of Michigan), AlSat (DLR) and QB50-GENSO (Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics) that rely on a limited number of amateur radio operators and expensive hardware with limited availability DGSN uses an innovative citizen science approach. The participatory aspect includes the deployment of ground-station hardware and acquisition of satellite signal data but also the open-source hardware. In this way a high number of built sensornodes can be achieved and it also creates a new market for selling ready ground-stations. The network owners an open-platform for every small satellite operator with a faster access to tracking data than the update period by NORAD or ESTRACK with less running costs. The low data-rate reception is compensated by the global and permanent coverage. DGSN will offer the orbital parameters of the received satellite signal under a free license. The feasibility study had been conducted as part of Azorean observing VERDE Sat during the Small Satellite Project at the Institute of Space Systems (IRS) of the University of Stuttgart and DGSN is in the prototyping and testing phase of the ground-stations. ©2013 by the International Astronautical Federation.

AB  - Mobile devices are currently used for an increasing number of activities. However, their use is still a challenge for blind users. Main problems are especially due to the interaction via touchscreen and the lack of hardware keys for quickly detecting or activating functions. In this paper we investigated the use of the tactile channel to make interaction with touch-based mobile devices easier for blind users. After introducing common touchscreen usability problems, we presented our proposal aimed at enriching the user interface with haptic points to aid blind user orientation on the main sections of a user interface. Starting from two use cases, in order to set-up the proposed solution we have developed a simple controller prototype, based on Arduino open-hardware. Copyright © 2013 ACM.

AB  - This paper presents the design and implementation of a wireless monitoring and actuation network for residential and commercial buildings that was carried out as part of the ARTEMIS funded project ME3gas. The aim of this deployment is to demonstrate that low cost wireless sensor networks can be used in situations where a full building management system may not be suitable technically or commercially either in residential home applications or commercial enterprises. This work focuses not just on electricity consumption but also on gas consumption into the building. The current deployment consists of a number of wireless sensor motes retrofitted throughout a residential building converted for office use. The WSN nodes are based on the Tyndall modular mote platform running the Contiki operating system and communicating with a mesh network running IPV6 through 6LoWPAN over IEEE 802.15.4 at 2.4GHz. Each node is configured for a specific task within the framework of enabling energy efficiency and these tasks can be broadly described as, environmental sensing, metering (gas and electricity) and actuation. The motes are controlled through the LinkSmart middleware platform which is an open source hardware agnostic system for building energy management, which hides the underlying physical layer allowing ease of development for web based applications, which is also demonstrated as part of this work.

AB  - Sound mixing is a well-established task applied (directly or indirectly) in many fields of music and sound production. For example, in the case of classical music orchestras, their conductors perform sound mixing by specifying the repro- duction gain of specific groups of musical instruments or of the entire orchestra. Moreover, modern sound artists and performers also employ sound mixing when they com- pose music or improvise in real-time. In this work a system is presented that incorporates a gestural interface for real- time multitrack sound mixing. The proposed gestural sound mixing control scheme is implemented on an open hardware micro-controller board, using common sensor modules. The gestures employed are as close as possible to the ones partic- ularly used by the orchestra conductors. The system overall performance is also evaluated in terms of the achieved user experience through subjective tests. Copyright © 2013 ACM.

AB  - Postnational, or after or more than national, is a world that connects the international with the local. Technollaboration, is how creative digital communities use technology to improve methods and environments for collaboration. Postbiotanical, after or more than biotanical, represents the future of human-centric collectives around farming and urban living and sustainability. Village, is ambiguous and raises the question how large is local, and how does a village-centric view impact the way we treat each other? Art traditionally functions as an environment for philosophical and creative activity that works to secure its borders from intruding dictatorial ethics, ideology, politics or dogma that might sully its aim to maintain its open arduous exploration of the clash between image and meaning, icon and significance, or perception and identity in reference to culture and history. Integrating technology into this discourse introduces a milieu of associations, expectations and conclusions about how technological innovation, practices and products should be steered, which can also influence what we both make and teach. The web has since evolved into a pervasively instantaneous space for more involved forms of communication (Google hangout), content sharing (SVN), publishing (blogs), community building (messageboards, Facebook), creative performance (Isadora) and more. Now creative interactive initiatives are not limited to merely making a statement or triggering a semiotic synapse, but rather can have a social impact, enacting, mobilizing and serving as a resource for the public. Telematic Art that includes the activities surrounding Digital Communities and their behaviour, does not merely provide an environment to discuss social issues, but embodies social interaction in ways in which new forms of collective expression can be realized. The development of telematics tools is empowering for the public while serving as a medium that influences how individuals interact. Between DIY/DIWO models, open source hardware, software, and creation initiatives, practivist initiatives, creative hacking ideologies, immersion, and web-based communication tools to localize the international collaborative workshop, I believe our formats for education and exchange are becoming more collective and empowering, and with the inclusion of digital social collaboration initiatives seen in myriad examples of Telematic Art, there exists the potential to motivate a mindset desiring new shifts in perception and making with the goals of serving the global community in significant and direct ways.

AB  - In FISITA 2010 IPEK (Institute of Product Engineering) introduced the vehicle-in-the-loop platform based on its X-in-the-loop approach (F2010-C-177) (Albers and Düser, Implementation of a vehicle-in-the-loop development and validation platform, FISITA world automotive congress, Budapest, 2010). It offers a methodology for multi domain product development and validation as well focuses on its key hypothesis that validation is the main task in every step of product development process. An open hardware and software platform allows integration of different real components and simulation models as well as the usage of established tools and methods for measurement and validation. The platform is based on a common hardware-in-the-loop System using extended I/O-communication to the vehicle and the test bench. The application is done in C code and Matlab/Simulink so an easy exchange of modular simulation models and test cases is feasible. The architecture of model-, component- and test case implementation simplifies the scalability as well as the modularization. IPEK uses this platform amongst others for its improved fully automated validation environment which allows the optimization of operating time for determination of shifting quality on the chassis dynamometer. The task is to perform several hundred gearshifts under particular reproducible conditions automatically such as engine speed or even battery state of charge, which normally a real driver had to perform on a real test track. Compared to road tests on the rig it is possible to reach time benefits of over 80% by using a special driver model for acceleration (using gas pedal), deceleration (using dynamometer) and gear shifting (using tip signal at steering wheel). Since the vehicle behaviour on the road is constrained to different environmental conditions it is necessary to reproduce these conditions on the test bench accurately. Different resistances affect the vehicles responses such as shifting strategy, acceleration characteristics or fuel consumption which results in altering test results. State of the art for simulating environmental conditions and vehicle characteristics on the chassis dynamometer is the Road-Load-Simulation (RLS) which uses measured vehicle coast downs to map the static resistances of a real car on a real track onto the test bench. These coast downs have to be redone every single time components of the car or the environment changes. In addition, changing resistances during test like air drag due to headwind and rolling drag due to tire temperature or abrasion can't be simulated based on that static coast down. This paper shows an approach for simulating all kind of resistances that can appear and vary during the test such as air drag (wind), road gradient, road friction, curve resistance etc. in real-time. It can be used to drive test cases like the determination of characteristic shifting map in a more realistic way to perform better validated results. Central point is a configurable vehicle and environment model which has to be parameterized with data from the real car and track and then calculates the necessary dynamometer responses. Applied with a four roller dynamometer (two or even four driven axles) it offers the possibility to perform complex all-wheel manoeuvres e.g. such as l-split or cornering with independent wheel behaviour and slip. Besides the advantages of this approach, an analysis of different influencing factors is shown in this paper. © Springer-Verlag 2013.

AB  - In this paper we introduce a definition of post-Turing ICT with an initial analysis of its sustainability. At the beginning of the history of computing the attention was concentrated on the single machine: a device able to read and write a memory and able to execute different actions depending on the internal state. It was only in the 1960's that the fifth function (after input, memory, processing and output) was introduced: the network, the capability of this single computational node to be connected and exchange data with similar machines. In the last fifty years the network has grown at an incredible speed, introducing us into the post-Turing ICT era: billions of electronic devices interconnected. ICT has now a significant environmental impact along all its lifetime phases: manufacturing (based on scarce minerals), application (based on growing power consumption) and e-waste management (with open cycles difficult to close). In this paper, we introduce relevant topics to understand whether the current ICT production and consumption paradigms are sustainable, and the social consequences and implications of such a problem for stakeholders. © 2012 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.

AB  - The open source software principles progressively give rise to new initiatives for culture (free culture), data (open data) or hardware (open hardware). The open hardware is experiencing a significant growth but the business models and legal aspects are not well known. This paper is dedicated to the economics of open hardware. We define the open hardware concept and determine intellectual property tools we can apply to open hardware, with a strong focus on open source licenses and practices. We next conduct some case studies in order to determine which licenses and business models are used by open hardware companies. We show some strong similarities with open source software and propose new opportunities for future works. © 2012 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.

AB  - Idleness has to be carefully exploited in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to save power and to accumulate the energy possibly harvested from the environment. State-of-the-art microcontroller units provide a wide range of ultra-low-power inactive modes with sub-millisecond wakeup time that can be effectively used for this purpose. At the same time they are equipped with 16-bit RISC architectures clocked at tens of MHz, which make them powerful enough to run a Java-compatible virtual machine (VM). This makes it possible to bring the benefits of a virtual runtime environment into power-constrained embedded systems. VMs, however, risk to impair the effectiveness of dynamic power management as they are seen as always-active processes by the scheduler of the operating system in spite of the idleness of the threads running on top of them. Avoiding to keep sensor nodes busy when they could be idle is mandatory for the energetic sustainability of WSNs. While most of the tasks of a sensor node are inherently event-driven, the functioning of its hardware-software components is not, so that they require to be redesigned in order to exploit idleness. This paper presents VirtualSense, an open-hardware open-source ultra-low-power reactive wireless sensor module featuring a Java-compatible VM. © 2012 Emanuele Lattanzi and Alessandro Bogliolo.

AB  - This paper describes open-source hardware to measure both the magnitude and phase of the electrical bioimpedance in a frequency range from few kilohertz up to 100 kHz by using a four-electrode technique. The amount of current injected and the sensitivity of the system can be set to the desired range by changing the front-end resistor values. The system can be easily built and adapted with the help of the design details made available at GitHub. The practical performance was evaluated in abdominal impedance measurement, which was the primary motivation to build the system. Other experiments were performed with a 2R-1C circuit, a 10-μ resistor, and a 100-nF capacitor, with observed relative errors in the impedances of -0.73 ± 0.34 %, -2.47 ± 1.43 % and -8.81 ± 0.64 % (mean ± SD), respectively, from 10 kHz to 100 kHz. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - Fiber-fed multi-object spectrographs have greatly enhanced the spectroscopic capabilities of the world's premiere telescopes, but their exibility has typically been limited by a fixed effective slit size that constrains the available resolving power. We present a novel mechanism that, for the first time, equips a fiber-fed spectrograph with multiple discreet slits of different widths. In this paper, we detail the mechanical design of our variable slit mechanism, which is capable of positioning any one of six slits in front of the fibers immediately prior to injection into the spectrograph's optical train. Further, we present the details of related systems necessary to achieve closed loop positioning of the slit mechanism given that no encoder is used. We also briey discuss our use of open source and open hardware projects in the design. Finally, we describe the control system we have implemented for this subsystem. © 2012 SPIE.

AB  - Biofeedback is a technique that teaches a user to control physiological signals by using mental processes. It has been used to treat mental and physical disorders such as stress, anxiety, diabetes, hypertension, headache, Raynaud's syndrome and other health problems. Biofeedback has conventionally been used at the office of the therapist. Mobile biofeedback may improve the outcomes as there would not be restrictions of place and time. The acquisition board is based on the open hardware Arduino and communicated by Bluetooth to the cellular phone which was programmed to implement thermal and electrodermal response (EDR) biofeedback. Five participants were part of this study, they were able to increase the temperature of the index finger and increase EDR levels using the equipment. Both techniques of biofeedback showed to decrease anxiety and stress greater than doing a relaxing activity. Stress levels were assessed by State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) questionnaire used to record stress and anxiety traits. This study suggests that biofeedback might be implemented on mobile devices as a therapeutic tool for stress and anxiety. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - The detection of anomalies in backbone networks is posing serious performance issues, not only in terms of accuracy, but also in terms of detection speed. Indeed current software solutions to the problem, even promising from the point of view of detection and false alarm rates, suffer from the inability of performing the required operations in real time, when working in high speed backbone networks. On the other hand, hardware solutions are based on costly and inflexible niche systems. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - During code review tasks, comparing two versions of a hardware design description using existing program differencing tools such as diff is inherently limited because these tools implicitly assume sequential execution semantics, while hardware description languages are designed to model concurrent computation. We designed a position-independent differencing algorithm to robustly handle language constructs whose relative orderings do not matter. This paper presents Vdiff, an instantiation of this position-independent differencing algorithm for Verilog HDL. To help programmers reason about the differences at a high-level, Vdiff outputs syntactic differences in terms of Verilog-specific change types. The quantitative evaluation of Vdiff on two open source hardware design projects shows that Vdiff is very accurate, with overall 96.8 % precision and 97.3 % recall when using manually classified differences as a basis of comparison. Vdiff is also fast and scalable-it processes the entire revision history of nine open projects all under 5.35 minutes. We conducted a user study with eight hardware design experts to understand how the program differences identified by the experts match Vdiff's output. The study results show that Vdiff's output is better aligned with the experts' classification of Verilog changes than an existing textual program differencing tool. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - This elaboration presents a new device based on dynamically programmable Analog Signal Processors (dpASP) developed for hard real-time control applications. The developed Programmable Analog Computer/Controller (PAC) is an open hardware for a wide range of signal processing tasks. In this report the analog signal routing and filter based signal processing realized by the dpASP is presented. This research was focused on the signals form as they are processed and transferred between analog processors. The investigation is exampled by the low-pass filter(s) embedded into every analog processor. For complex signal processing tasks a few dpASP must be routed together. The dpASP chain is created for signal diagnosis and due to the limited resources of a single device. Final conclusions related to chaining analog processors are given.

AB  - One of the most demanding challenges in the field of audio engineering is the transmission of low-latency high quality audio streams over networks. While several protocols nowadays allow wired local network streaming, much effort is still required to achieve similar goals over existing wireless LAN technologies. While the challenge is still far from being solved, several design issues can be highlighted and future scenarios can be outlined. This paper proposes the setup of a wireless music production system based on open hardware and open software which requires relatively low setup effort while allowing for a high flexibility of use. The hardware platform is the Beagleboard, based on Texas Instruments DM3730, running a GNU/Linux OS and the computer music language Pure Data. Such a device can capture electric instrument audio, generate sound, send MIDI or OSC control data, and stream to PCs and other embedded devices operating as mixers, effect racks and so on, enabling an ecosystem of flexible and open devices. Tests conducted on a home wireless network show acceptable latency for many applications. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - The real-time monitoring of events in an industrial plant is vital, to monitor the actual conditions of operation of the machinery responsible for the manufacturing process. A predictive maintenance program includes condition monitoring of the rotating machinery, to anticipate possible conditions of failure. To increase the operational reliability it is thus necessary an efficient tool to analyze and monitor the equipments, in real-time, and enabling the detection of e.g. incipient faults in bearings. To fulfill these requirements some innovations have become frequent, namely the inclusion of vibration sensors or stator current sensors. These innovations enable the development of new design methodologies that take into account the ease of future modifications, upgrades, and replacement of the monitored machine, as well as expansion of the monitoring system. This paper presents the development, implementation and testing of an instrument for vibration monitoring, as a possible solution to embed in industrial environment. The digital control system is based on an FPGA, and its configuration with an open hardware design tool is described. Special focus is given to the area of fault detection in rolling bearings. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - Indoor localization is an important part of integrated AAL solutions providing continuous services to elderly persons. They are able to fulfill multiple purposes, ranging from energy saving or location based reminders to burglary detection. Particularly useful are combined systems that include localization, as well as additional services e.g. fall detection. Capacitive sensing systems that allow detecting the presence of a body over distance are a possible solution for indoor localization that has been used in the past. However usually the installation requirements are high and consequently they are expensive to integrate. We propose a flexible, integrated solution based on affordable, open-source hardware that allows indoor localization and fall detection specifically designed for challenges in the context of AAL. The system is composed of sensing mats that can be placed under various types of floor covering that wirelessly transmit data to a central platform providing localization and fall detection services to connected AAL platforms. The system was evaluated noncompetitive in the 2011 EvAAL indoor localization competition. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - This paper presents an open embedded hardware and software architecture for industrial robot control. Open hardware refers to open source IP-core provided by the authors, while open software implies the use of open source software, specifically Linux and OROCOS [1]. Embedded implies integration of various functional blocks on one System-On-Chip board, for data acquisition, computation and control tasks, of relatively small size and low power consumption, compared to regular PC-based industrial controllers. The proposed architecture is a hardware and software co-design where an operating system running on an embedded processor drives the FPGA hardware controllers. It is industrial robot type independent, as long as the motors are equipped with incremental position encoders and driven by PWM signals. The architecture has been tested on an industrial Performer MK2 robot setup. Low cost, low power consumption, remarkable stability, high flexibility and expandability are the key advantages of the architecture for industrial robot control. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - The wind load provisions of Chapter 6 in ASCE 7-05 Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures have been reorganized into six chapters in the 2010 edition. Technical changes include the introduction of new wind speed maps to be used with a 1.0 load factor for LRFD and a 0.6 load factor for ASD, the reintroduction of Exposure D for water surfaces in Hurricane-Prone Regions, and revised wind-borne debris regions. The present guideline Wind Loads and Anchor Bolt Design for Petrochemical Facilities (1997) by ASCE Petrochemical Energy Committee is commonly used in the industry for calculating wind loads on nonbuilding structures and components. The new edition of this publication Wind Loads for Petrochemical and Other Industrial Facilities was released in September 2011 based on the provisions of ASCE 7-05. This paper addresses the important changes to the wind load provisions of ASCE 7- 10 for non-building structures and components. This paper also provides comparative parametric studies of wind loads calculated using the analytical procedures based on the 2011 edition of Wind Loads for Petrochemical and Other Industrial Facilities and the provisions of ASCE 7-10 for new non-building structures and components, including pipe racks, open equipment structures, and vertical vessels. © ASCE 2012.

AB  - It is not uncommon to have petrochemical facilities such as refineries, natural gas processing facilities and pipe line projects located in cold and arctic regions. The snow and ice considerations of the non-building structures and the components present unique design considerations for engineers. Non-building structures such as pipe bridges, pipe racks, multi level open equipment structures, storage tanks, electrical cable tray, air coolers, and equipment supporting structures retain snow differently than buildings. ASCE 7 does not have specific provisions for snow and ice on non building structures and components. Process Industry Practices (PI) and American Petroleum Institute (API) recommendations do not give comprehensive design procedures or guidelines for calculating snow and ice loads on non-building structures and components. Engineering judgment is used for adapting the snow and ice provisions for buildings to non-building structures. Calculation of the snow and ice loads becomes even more critical if the facility in a high seismic zone due to the added seismic mass. This paper provides recommendations for calculating the snow and ice loads for non-building structures and components based on the knowledge and experience of the authors. Snow loading on specific non-building structures are examined and recommendations based on current industry practices are presented. © ASCE 2012.

AB  - An open source automation system for controlling electrical appliances using power line communication is presented here. Control messages are sent over Wi-Fi network from a Wi-Fi device to the microcontroller which then couples the messages to the power lines. Ubiquitous power lines are used as physical media to transmit data over 220V/50Hz signal to control appliances/equipment. The data from the microcontroller is coupled onto the power lines using a PLC (Power Line Communication) modem and DCSK (Differential Code Shift Keying) modulation technique is employed to transmit data. Each receiver unit consists of PLC modem plus microcontroller and can be connected anywhere in the power line network. The receivers have addresses assigned to them and only respond to the commands sent to them by the transmitter PLC modem. The receiver unit controls the flow of electricity to the socket. The entire system is devoid of a computer to save power and make it low cost. Use of open source hardware, Power Line Communication and micro-controller collectively reduce the cost of controlling appliances remotely. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - Ikimo is a low-cost entry level robotics ecosystem build under Open Source Hardware license developed initally as part of research project in Keio University. The project was motivated by the lack of financially accessible robots on the market that would be able to support very wide scope of research projects, that vary in complexity and demands on the technology - including the needs for possible modifications both to software and hardware. Ikimo also functions as cheap robotics learning platform. It integrates physical designs, hardware and software and thus provides set of tools for various robotics applications, allowing modification based on users' demands, as everything is shared under open source licenses. Ikimo was devised as an alternative to other robotics system used in research projects, such as Roomba, that do not (or do only partially) allow the modifications based on the application needs. © 2012 ACM.

AB  - The commercial success of open source software, along with a broader socio-cultural shift towards participation in media and cultural production, have inspired attempts to extend and expand open source practices. These include expansions from software into general culture through 'Free Culture' movements and, more recently, expansions from software into hardware and design. This article provides a critical perspective on the democratic potential of these broader 'open' contribution structures by examining how open source contributions to both software and hardware increase the opportunities for democratic participation in production, governance and knowledge exchange. By analysing attempts to 'open source' the sharing of hardware designs, it also notes the limitations of this democratization. The insights developed in the article nuance the relationship between open source cultures and commercial and market structures, identifying how the generative opportunities created by certain aspects of open source contribution structures increase the potential for democratizing production of communication tools, but also how incongruities across different open-source cultures and communities of practice limit the democratic potential of these processes. © The Author(s) 2012.

AB  - This paper investigates the use of digital fabrication for the individual production and customization of electronic devices. We present two products - a pair of speakers with laser-cut parts and a computer mouse with a 3D-printed enclosure - and describe their making and modification by workshop participants. The speakers target a general audience, engaging a diversity of skills and backgrounds. The mouse aims at designers, exploring the application of 3D modeling skills to the production of electronic devices. We use the case studies to discuss general implications of digital fabrication for technology production and education: enabling collaboration and iteration through open-source hardware, enhancing the products of educational technologies and experiences, and increasing the diversity of and personal connections to electronic products. The case studies also suggest opportunities for further research into tools, materials, and people. © 2012 ACM.

AB  - In this paper the design and manufacturing processes for coreless axial flux permanent magnet generators are described for low cost rural electrification applications, where local production of small wind turbines is considered. The process is based on already existing open source design and construction manuals, while a systematic approach to designing generators of varying nominal power and for grid connection or direct battery charging schemes is described. The manufacturing process of a 3 kW small wind turbine generator for grid connection is used as a case study. Emphasis is given to the use of simple tools and techniques to achieve a lower cost, while intricate steps in the manufacturing process are described in more detail. The generator design is simulated and the constructed machine is tested in the laboratory.

AB  - Open source hardware is a type of hardware where the schematics and designs are made unrestricted and available to all. They are often accompanied by open source software. This can bring reliability, ease of debugging, and modular development for rapid prototyping using pre-written libraries. Merits of using open source hardware are discussed and then applied to a portable sensor system based on the open hardware Arduino-derived Jeenode microcontroller board. The system uses an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and seamless integration of other sensors, including a piezo-resistive pressure sensor. It is shown that open source hardware can help to increase rapid development, reduce costs, and encourage further development. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper the authors intend to demonstrate the utilization of remote experimentation (RE) using mobile computational devices in the Science areas of the elementary school, with the purpose to develop practices that will help in the assimilation process of the subjects taught in classroom seeking to interlink them with the daily students' activities. Allying mobility with RE we intend to minimize the space-temporal barrier giving more availability and speed in the information access. The implemented architecture utilizes technologies and freely distributed softwares with open code resources besides remotes experiments developed in the Laboratory of Remote Experimentation (RExLab) of Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC), in Brazil, through the physical computation platform of the open hardware of self-construction type. The utilization of open code computational tools and the integration of hardware to the 3D virtual worlds, accessible through mobile devices, give to the project an innovative face with a high potential for reproducibility and reusability. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - Urban spaces are pervaded by interpretive and reactive technologies that shape and are shaped by its inhabitants, with an increasingly active role for citizen technologists. Yet the role of domestic spaces in shaping lived experience within the urban environment, and subsequent technological interventions, is often overlooked. Homes are framed as closed-off environments which isolate their inhabitants from the city, despite being porous spaces that are also filled with ubiquitous computing. In this paper we draw on the participatory design and user innovation literatures to present the methodology for the "Homesense" research project that explored how users design and develop "smart" technologies within their own homes, based on the intersection of their concurrent urban/domestic lived experience. Kits of open-source hardware were used as cultural probes, and co-located "lead users" provided technical expertise. This methodology demonstrates the importance of physical space and location in user-led domestic activities, and of combinations of technical and "lived" expertise in developing these interventions. © 2012 Copyright The Society of Urban Technology.

AB  - Microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs) are superconducting detectors capable of counting single photons and measuring their energy in the UV, optical, and near-IR. MKIDs feature intrinsic frequency domain multiplexing (FDM) at microwave frequencies, allowing the construction and readout of large arrays. Due to the microwave FDM, MKIDs do not require the complex cryogenic multiplexing electronics used for similar detectors, such as transition edge sensors, but instead transfer this complexity to room temperature electronics where they present a formidable signal processing challenge. In this paper, we describe the first successful effort to build a readout for a photon counting optical/near-IR astronomical instrument, the ARray Camera for Optical to Near-infrared Spectrophotometry. This readout is based on open source hardware developed by the Collaboration for Astronomy Signal Processing and Electronics Research. Designed principally for radio telescope backends, it is flexible enough to be used for a variety of signal processing applications. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.

AB  - The real-time monitoring of events in an industrial plant is an advanced technique that presents the real conditions of operation of the machinery responsible for the manufacturing process. A predictive maintenance program includes various rotating machinery condition monitoring techniques of the machine to determine the conditions of failure. To increase the operational reliability and to reduce preventive maintenance, it is necessary an efficient tool for analysis and process monitoring, in real time, enabling the detection of incipient faults for rolling bearings. Over the past few years there has been a major technological developments related to digital system, including innovations in both hardware and software. These innovations enable the development of new design methodologies that take into account the ease of future modifications, upgrades and expansions of the designed system. This paper presents a study of new design tools for embedded digital systems based on open hardware architecture with reconfigurable logic. Will be discussed a case study in the area of fault detection of rolling bearings, as well as its implementation and testing. © 2012, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

AB  - This paper looks at collaboration in open-source hardware: physical goods whose digital design files are shared for others to make or modify. Through research into nine variations on the Arduino Duemilanove (an electronic circuit board) and interviews with their developers, we explore the process and outcome of open-source hardware development. We find a structure that differs substantially from that of most open-source software projects, involving many small-scale collaborations rather than a centralized process. We discuss three possible reasons for this structure: differing component selections, the investment required for prototyping, and the lack of software collaboration tools. © 2012 ACM.

AB  - CERN makes extensive use of the WorldFIP fieldbus interface in the LHC and other accelerators in the pre-injectors chain. Following the decision of the provider of the components to stop the developments in this field and foreseeing the potential problems in the subsequent support, CERN decided to purchase the design information of these components and in-source the future developments using this technology. The first in-house design concerns a replacement for the MicroFIP chip whose last version was manufactured in an IC feature size found to be more vulnerable to radiation of high energy particles than the previous versions. nanoFIP is a CERN design based on a Flash FPGA implementing a subset of the functionality allowed by the communication standard, fitting the requirements of the different users and including the robustness against radiation as a design constraint. The development presented involved several groups at CERN working together in the framework of the Open Hardware Repository collaboration, and aiming at maximizing the interoperability and reliability of the final product. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd and Sissa Medialab srl.

AB  - One leader in this niche is SparkFun Electronics, started by Nathan Seidle, a newly minted EE from the University of Colorado. Seidle had been looking for a source of small quantities of sometimes-obscure electronic parts and began offering them himself. Adafruit Industries has a similar story of how it got into the parts/kit business with detailed tutorials that include step-bystep instructions and photographs to lead newbies through the basics of Ohm's Law and soldering, and on to programming the open-source hardware Arduino platform. Then Adafruit fielded the part premounted on a small pc board with a couple of chip resistors and some headers, along with a tutorial as well as a software library for the open-source Arduino platform. Digi-Key Corp. had a similar start back in 1972, selling its Digi-Keyer Kit to ham radio enthusiasts. Today it is a $1 billion company. History could repeat itself with a whole new generation of parts and kits providers.

AB  - This paper documents the iterative design and development of six operational vertical axis wind turbine prototypes tailor built for rural electrification projects in Central America. All prototypes have been based on the unique lift type blade system consisting of sailcloth material which allows for the turbine to operate with variable blade pitch and profile camber. The latest prototype is presented along with a detailed discussion of fundamental design aspects such as the sail blades, frame tower, alternator, and transmission systems. The VosREC headquarters for research, development and testing is located in a remote, rural, and non-electrified village in Nicaragua. This location provides researchers with the unique opportunity to experience and observe first-hand how renewable energy technologies can be applied to improve quality of life for people living without connection to national electricity grids. Aspects and benefits of the "open source hardware" approach are presented along with a discussion on implementation models, "bottom-up", empowerment and self-organization. Copyright © 2012 by ASME.

AB  - The FireFader is a simple haptic force-feedback device that is optimized for introducing musician to haptics. It has one degree of freedom and is based upon a mass-produced linear potentiometer fader coupled to a DC motor, also known as a "motorized fader." Lights are connected in parallel with the motor to help visually communicate the strength of the force. Compatible with OS X, Linux, and Windows, the FireFader consists of only open-source hardware and software elements. Consequently, it is also relatively easy for users to re-purpose it into new projects involving varying kinds and numbers of motors and sensors. An open-source device driver for the FireFader allows it to be linked to a laptop computer via USB so that the computer can perform the feedback control calculations. For example, the laptop can simulate the acoustics of a virtual musical instrument to calculate the motor force as a function of the fader position. The serial connection over USB causes delay of the control signal, but the serial connection facilitates easier programming via the laptop, and the force feedback can be disabled when the user is not touching the fader. Some new devices derived from the FireFader design are presented. © 2012 Edgar Berdahl et al.

AB  - We describe a new, quadruped robot platform, Aracna, which requires non-intuitive motor commands in order to locomote and thus provides an interesting challenge for gait learning algorithms, such as those frequently developed in the Evolutionary Computation and Artificial Life communities. Aracna is an open-source hardware project composed of off-the-shelf and 3D-printed parts, enabling other research teams to modify its design according to their scientific needs. Aracna was designed to overcome the shortcomings of a previous quadruped robot platform, whose legs were so heavy that the motors could not reliably execute the commands sent to them. We avoid this problem by locating all motors in the body core instead of on the legs and through a design which enables the servos to have a greater mechanical advantage. Specifically, each of the four legs has two joints controlled by separate four-bar linkage mechanisms that drive the pitch of the hip joint and knee joint. This novel design causes unconventional kinematics, creating an opportunity for gaitlearning algorithms, which excel in counter-intuitive design spaces where human engineers tend to underperform. Because it is low-cost, flexible, kinematically interesting, and and improvement over a previous design, Aracna provides a useful new hardware platform for testing algorithms that automatically generate robotic behaviors. © 2012 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

AB  - Measuring the height of the vertical jump is an indicator of the strength and power of the lower body. The technological tools available to measure the vertical jump are black boxes and are not open to third-party verification or adaptation. We propose the creation of a measurement system called Chronojump-Boscosystem, consisting of open hardware and free software. Methods: A microcontroller was created and validated using a square wave generator and an oscilloscope. Two types of contact platforms were developed using different materials. These platforms were validated by the minimum pressure required for activation at different points by a strain gauge, together with the on/off time of our platforms in respect of the Ergojump-Boscosystem platform by a sample of 8 subjects performing submaximal jumps with one foot on each platform. Agile methodologies were used to develop and validate the software. Results: All the tools fall under the free software / open hardware guidelines and are, in that sense, free. The microcontroller margin of error is 0.1%. The validity of the fiberglass platform is 0.95 (ICC). The management software contains nearly 113.000 lines of code and is available in 7 languages.

AB  - The integration of the appropriate pedagogic methods for incorporating technologybased disciplines can be challenging within the design curriculum. However designers and design students who also possess the appropriate technological skills are being viewed by an ever increasing number of commercial organisations as valuable company assets. This paper discusses how the design team within NTU is using this platform to enhance the technological experience and knowledge of undergraduate, postgraduate and research degree students. A number of case studies demonstrate how such a relatively inexpensive and simple programming platform is being successfully utilised for a wide variety of design and research applications.

AB  - "Atoms are the new bits". That is the latest buzz arising from the Californian trade press. What do we get when this dictum is sampled with the old rallying cry: "Information wants to be free"? We suggest that the predominant, bounded critique of intellectual property is thereby destabilised. Constitutive of that critique was the exceptionality attributed to infor-mation goods (bits) vis-a-vis tangible goods (atoms). It was thus intellectual property could be presented as something altogether different from private property. We recognise that this way of framing the issue has had tactical advantages, but contend that it has stood in the way of a deeper understanding of what intellectual property is. When the critique of proprie-tary software is expanded by an emerging movement for open hardware development, however, the boundary between intellectual property and property as such crumbles. This enables us to renew our critique of the political economy of infor-mation.

AB  - This article's objective is to set up some foundational theory and practices for Open Source Development (OSD) of tangible products, a novel and emerging approach derived from the well-known open source software movement. As a contribution to the first steps of research in this discipline a clear definition for OSD is proposed and used to describe the key elements of a suggested OSD Process model. Several case studies are analysed to create an Archetypal Business Model characterising OSD of tangible products and the possibilities and delimitations within. Furthermore, strategic tools are suggested for companies that wish to explore the potentials OSD brings which form a so called OSD Method. The result of the method is the OSD Strategy and implementation thereof. This is done with the objective of determining the potential profitability that lies within OSD of tangible products and how companies can utilise this new approach to improve their business models and capture value in innovative ways. © 2012 NordDesign.All right reserved.

AB  - STEP-NC standard contains information on how CNC machine tools can be represented from STEP product data model. STEP-NC is an extension of STEP which is the standard for exchange product model data. This determines the neutral data format for digital information from a product. This paper is to propose an architecture of intelligent controller via multi-agent-based conceptual as the reference architecture. It can be successfully used to create an open CNC on ISO standard of ISO 14649 and ISO 10303. This offers interoperability, portability, and adaptability. The proposed framework consists of four main modules, STEP-NC interface, simulator, data warehouse, and communication. In order to optimize, the controller should incorporate with various technology related to intelligent, such as kernel software, open communication port and open hardware design. The architecture will be implemented in CNC controller and to be tested later on actual milling machine. It will simplify the design of CNC machine controller with the architecture layers responsible for data processing, data storage, execution and feedback. This paper will discuss order towards the requirements for global interoperable manufacturing for real-life machining system.

AB  - Because of the intrinsic advantages of wireless inertial motion tracking, standalone devices that integrate inertial motion units with wireless networking capabilities have gained much interest in recent years. Several platforms, both commercially available and academic, have been proposed to balance the challenges of a small form-factor, power consumption, accuracy and processing speed. Applications include ambulatory monitoring to support healthcare, sport activity analysis, recognizing human group behaviour, navigation support for humans, robots and unmanned vehicles, but also in structural monitoring of large buildings. This paper provides an analysis of the current state-of-the-art platforms in wireless inertial motion tracking and presents a novel open-source and open-hardware hybrid tracking platform that is extensible, low-power, flexible enough to be used for both short- and long-term monitoring and based on a firmware that allows it to be easily adapted after being deployed. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - Digital acquisition system designers have an always increasing number of options in terms of bus standards and digital signal processing hardware among which to choose. This allows for high flexibility but also opens the door to a proliferation of different architectures, potentially limiting the reusability and the design synergies among the various instrumentation groups. This contribution illustrates the design trends in some of the major institutes around the world with design examples including VME [1], PCI [2] and TCA [3] based modular systems using AMC [3] and/or FMC [4] mezzanines. Some examples of FPGA design practices aimed at increasing reusability of code will be mentioned together with some of the tools already available to designers to improve the information exchange and collaboration, like the Open Hardware Repository [5] project.

AB  - Mobile pervasive healthcare technologies can support a wide range of applications and services including patient monitoring and emergency response. At the same time they introduce several challenges, like data storage and management, interoperability and availability of heterogeneous resources, unified and ubiquitous access issues. One potential solution for addressing all aforementioned issues is the introduction of the Cloud Computing concept. Within this context, in this work we have developed and present a wearable - textile platform based on open hardware and software that collects motion and heartbeat data and stores them wirelessly on an open Cloud infrastructure for monitoring and further processing. The proposed system may be used to promote the independent living of patient and elderly requiring constant surveillance. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - The present work is focused on Software Defined Radar - (SDR) paradigm, which gives a more versatile solution when compared to classical radar systems. Thanks to this new system model, most of the fundamental operations, such as signal generation, filtering, up and down conversion, are easily implemented via software. The objective of this paper is to show the main issues related to the design of an effective Software Defined Radar device. Specifically, we will discuss and face the synchronization issues existing between a received and a transmitted signal when an open source hardware, namely the Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP), is considered. © 2011 ACM.

AB  - In this paper, we describe a new hardware tool to test new Quality of Service proposals. Thus, we want to reduce the digital divide between Latin America development countries. The problem is that in our region it is difficult to build hardware prototypes for new networking protocols and methods. Our tool, named U2-Route, is based on a NetFPGA board, an open source hardware system developed in Stanford University. U2-Route has a routing core and a Web Interface that allows research groups belonging to Universities to test new developments. As an example, we show the methodology to design and to implement a Classifier and the results obtained. © 2011 ACM.

AB  - CERN makes extensive use of the WorldFIP fieldbus interface in the LHC and other accelerators in the preinjectors chain. Following the decision of the provider of the components to stop the developments in this field and foreseeing the potential problems in the subsequent support, CERN decided to purchase the design information of these components and in-source the future developments using this technology. The first in-house design concerns a replacement for the MicroFIP chip whose last version was manufactured in an IC feature size found to be more vulnerable to radiation of high energy particles than the previous versions. NanoFIP is a CERN design based on a Flash FPGA implementing a subset of the functionality allowed by the communication standard, fitting the requirements of the different users and including the robustness against radiation as a design constraint. The development presented involved several groups at CERN working together in the framework of the Open Hardware Repository collaboration, and aiming at maximizing the interoperability and reliability of the final product.

AB  - This paper presents the development and testing of an open and flexible embedded system applied to positioning and telecontrol (OFESAPO) for outdoor applications. The system is composed of a control center (CC) and a set of remote terminal units (RTUs); the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 60870-5 series has been chosen for communication among them. This is a standard protocol of real-time telecontrol applications. The CC is a personal computer, and the RTUs are based on open hardware and software. The RTU hardware is an embedded system, i.e., a system-on-chip-type design using field-programmable gate array that has been programmed with the open-core LEON running Linux operating system. For prototyping, the GR-XC3S-1500 board has been used. As there is no open source code available for the IEC standard protocols, an open source code has also been implemented. Hence, both the hardware and the software are open source in OFESAPO. Several tests have been made to show the system's limitations and the suitability for real-time applications. A prototype has also been tested in a real environment, where the real position of two moving RTUs was shown by a CC using Google Map. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - Data centers' energy consumption has attracted global attention because of the fast growth of the information technology (IT) industry. Up to 60% of the energy consumed in a data center is used for cooling in wasteful ways as a result of lack of environmental information and overcompensated cooling systems. In this project, a wireless sensor network for data-enter environmental monitoring was developed to improve energy efficiency and to optimize data-center performance. The sensor network consists of a suite of sensor nodes for data sensing, a router node to relay sensed data, and a coordinator node to establish a network, receive the data, and process the data. The prototype sensor network was built on Arduino open source hardware with a seamlessly integrated XBee RF module and configured to operate within the ZigBee mesh network standard. A 24-hour test run at Argonne's data center demonstrated that the wireless networked environmental monitoring solution is easy to integrate and manage with the existing IT infrastructure, while delivering better visibility into the data center's 3D temperature and humidity distribution and substantial improvements in energy efficiency. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - A large proportion of the space industry is moribund with long development cycles, high, rising (or at best stagnant) costs, and an extreme aversion to risk. Meanwhile, other industries such as consumer electronics see development cycles between 3-6 months, exponentially lowering costs per unit capability and a more lenient attitude towards risk. Why aren't these trends seen more widely in the space industry? Based on our experience with the NASA "PhoneSat 1.0" mission and the joint SSTL and Surrey Space Centre "STRaND-I" mission, we explore the possibilities that arise by adopting and exploiting innovations from outside industries. The smartphone technology central to both our efforts is a good example, with the smartphone industry investing billions of dollars to produce robust, tightly packaged devices with very high levels of capability. Using this technology as-is offers many benefits for space applications. These include leveraging widespread open source software, the opportunity for extreme rapid prototyping, and faster, cheaper missions with potentially higher capability. Significantly, this approach dictates a new paradigm with different rules where the large consumer electronics industry leads and the space sector follows. There is room for greater risk tolerance, spacecraft can be disposable (while still being mindful of debris issues). They can be designed, built and be flight ready on very tight timescales (days or weeks), and also launched in great quantities (hundreds, thousands), offering technological and responsive capabilities not feasible today. They integrate more advanced multi-core technologies. The fast iteration time-scales of the hardware coupled with open source software and open hardware platforms also allow for rapid prototyping and testing of spaceflight software. The capability for fast release cycles is something not typically seen in space-flight software. Smartphones in particular offer standardized platforms for software development, as well as very large communities of talented programmers. This allows the focus of innovation to ultimately shift away from the hardware, and further into the software and information technology domains. The open source aspects of our efforts also open up the opportunity for many people to undertake their own space exploration, from school students to hobbyists. While CubeSats and other opportunities have been possible for some time, it is only through this approach that we are capable of easily producing high-capability spacecraft within the means of ordinary people. This means that their efforts are also meaningful, and could provide valuable contributions to science and human well being on Earth. Copyright ©2010 by the International Astronautical Federation.

AB  - Despite the internet's dynamic and collaborative nature, scientists continue to produce grant proposals, lab notebooks, data files, conclusions etc. that stay in static formats or are not published online and therefore not always easily accessible to the interested public. Because of limited adoption of tools that seamlessly integrate all aspects of a research project (conception, data generation, data evaluation, peerreviewing and publishing of conclusions), much effort is later spent on reproducing or reformatting individual entities before they can be repurposed independently or as parts of articles. We propose that workows-performed both individually and collaboratively-could potentially become more efficient if all steps of the research cycle were coherently represented online and the underlying data were formatted, annotated and licensed for reuse. Such a system would accelerate the process of taking projects from conception to publication stages and allow for continuous updating of the data sets and their interpretation as well as their integration into other independent projects. A major advantage of such workows is the increased transparency, both with respect to the scientific process as to the contribution of each participant. The latter point is important from a perspective of motivation, as it enables the allocation of reputation, which creates incentives for scientists to contribute to projects. Such workow platforms offering possibilities to fine-tune the accessibility of their content could gradually pave the path from the current static mode of research presentation into a more coherent practice of open science.

AB  - This gesture recognizer, developed by students in a third-year microprocessor-based laboratory course, takes Wii remote (Wiimote) as an input device to estimate the movements of the user and to compare the detected trajectory with the previously learnt movements, in order to carry out the associated actions. Such a cheap state-of-the-art wireless user interface is very attractive for the students and can be used in many interactive applications, from robotics to virtual reality and multimedia presentations. By combining commercially-available hardware, pattern-matching techniques and programming skills, we are able to foster students' interest on developing innovative potentiallymarketable systems. This freeware project, implemented as a configurable publicly-available library, can be adapted to the needs of any course or student. In our laboratory this open-source DLL is used for remotely controlling a robot (based on an open-hardware Arduino platform), using a PC and the Wiimote, although the DLL can be integrated in any C, C++, Java or C# project. A GUI application (based on a Model-View-Presenter paradigm) is also provided and can be used as a template for new applications or just for debugging purposes. Although the developed application only uses data from the accelerometers, data from the infrared camera and buttons of the Wiimote is also available.

AB  - High end print management systems offer integrated credit reception and efficient, parametrized accounting for the use of resources. Thus, print management inherently conforms with the rationale and mentality of green and eco-friendly technologies which also relate with the ethos of the open source movement in IT. The current paper presents the design of an open system that integrates the provision of automated credit reception with accounting services in order to produce an open solution that fully automates the process of print charging. The objective of the system is to decide and design the necessary automations for credit reception so that it can be realized without any human intervention, to plan the integration with a suitable open print accounting system and to specify any complementary utilities and tools necessary for pilot and production installations. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - Today conditional access (CA) and digital rights management (DRM) systems for digital TV, either broadcast or broadband, show an impressive lack of interoperability. The German Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur) has organized a collaboration of industry experts defining a truly interoperable architecture for CA/DRM systems for broadcast, broadband and "over the top (OTT)". The architecture allows owners of consumer premises equipment (CPE), like set top boxes, personal video recorders or TV sets, to have embedded CA/DRM from any vendor. The required security kernel can be downloaded in a designated software container with standardized interfaces. The download process is protected by proven methods, and under control of a trusted third party. Open hardware facilities in the CPE with proven security further support enhanced security, ensuring the best possible protection of the content. The result is a highly consumer friendly interoperability solution, for the first time truly merging TV over Internet and broadcast, without any compromise regarding security. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - The proliferation of open source hardware platforms and consequent connected objects has created novel design opportunities for end-users to realize their personalized "life-hacks" in an interactive environment. However, this lifehack culture is yet to become a mainstream practice due to the complexity of the creation process, application provisioning and the lack of appropriate distribution channels. In this paper, we address the first two issues and present a system platform that empowers ordinary individuals to create and share their personalized sensor driven applications in a highly abstract manner towards a co-creation ecosystem. Essentially, our platform enables users to i) attach personal concepts (abstraction) to sensor data, ii) create personalized visualization of sensor data and iii) share these concepts and visualizations with others to facilitate in-situ search and a co-creation experience. We present the design space and technical description of the corresponding system platform. A feasibility study suggests that the proposed approach is simple, comprehensive and has the potential for facilitating creativity in the connected object space. © 2011 ACM.

AB  - Traditionally, studies of open innovation (OI) focused on high-tech industry. Though consumer goods industry is increasingly adopting online open innovation (OOI), managers are unclear about the trends of OOI. This study proposes a new classification of OOI in consumer goods industry: firm-led OOI and customer-led OOI, and identify the evolution trends of customer-led OOI. The finding is based on a longitudinal study of 138 cases. The results highlight the important areas that managers should pay particular attention to. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - A Clicker or a wireless student response system is an example of a high density simple response ubiquitous system that processes real-time simple responses from a large number of students in a controlled environment like a classroom. Currently such systems are expensive and use proprietary hardware which makes it difficult to extend them for novel learning scenarios. This paper presents the design and implementation of a hybrid low-cost open-source hardware platform called InfoCoral that uses the 1-Wire wired protocol in conjunction with Bluetooth or a Zigbee wireless interface. The hardware also employs the open-source Arduino software for ease of programming and customization. A Case study of applying this platform to build a low-cost clicker system for a K-12 classroom is also presented. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - Although potentiostats are the foundation of modern electrochemical research, they have seen relatively little application in resource poor settings, such as undergraduate laboratory courses and the developing world. One reason for the low penetration of potentiostats is their cost, as even the least expensive commercially available laboratory potentiostats sell for more than one thousand dollars. An inexpensive electrochemical workstation could thus prove useful in educational labs, and increase access to electrochemistry-based analytical techniques for food, drug and environmental monitoring. With these motivations in mind, we describe here the CheapStat, an inexpensive (<$80), open-source (software and hardware), hand-held potentiostat that can be constructed by anyone who is proficient at assembling circuits. This device supports a number of potential waveforms necessary to perform cyclic, square wave, linear sweep and anodic stripping voltammetry. As we demonstrate, it is suitable for a wide range of applications ranging from food- and drug-quality testing to environmental monitoring, rapid DNA detection, and educational exercises. The device's schematics, parts lists, circuit board layout files, sample experiments, and detailed assembly instructions are available in the supporting information and are released under an open hardware license. © 2011 Rowe et al.

AB  - We present SensLAB, a very large scale wireless sensor network testbed 1. SensLAB is distributed among 4 sites having different topologies and consists of 1024 wireless nodes based on open source hardware &amp; software. Within a given site, each one of the 256 nodes is able to communicate via its radio interface (868Mhz or 2.4Ghz) to its neighbors. Furthermore, every sensor node is potentially configurable as a sink node and can exchange data with any other sink node of the whole SensLAB testbed and/or Internet application. The testbed is designed to achieve reproducibility of experimentation, while also supporting evaluation of protocols and applications in real world settings. It allows to monitor transparently, i.e., without any insertion/modification within the code, any deployed application in terms of energy consumption or radio activity. The main benefits of SensLAB for the users are to reduce the costs in terms of: infrastructure investment, maintenance cost and operating cost. With SensLAB you can be up and running minutes after you are assigned an account! SensLAB's main and most important goal is to offer an accurate open access multi-users scientific tool to support the design, development, tuning, and experimentation of real large-scale sensor network applications. During this demo, we propose to demonstrate the interests of the SensLAB testbed by developing and running two experimental scenarii that highlight the services offered by SensLAB. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - In the last years the functionality and type of UAV-systems increased fast, but unfortunately these systems are hardly available for researchers in some cases. A simple and low-cost solution was developed to build an autonomous aerial surveying airplane, which can fulfil the necessities (aerial photographs with very-high resolution) of other departments at the university and very useful and practical for teaching photogrammetry. The base was a commercial, remote controlled model airplane and an open-source GPS/IMU system (MatrixPilot) was adapted to achieve the semi- Automatic or automatic stabilization and navigation of the model airplane along predefined trajectory. The firmware is completely open-source and easily available on the website of the project. The first used camera system was a low-budget, low-quality video camera, which could provide only 1.2 megapixel photographs or low resolution video depending on the light conditions and the desired spatial resolution. A field measurement test was carried out with the described system: The aerial surveying of an undiscovered archaeological site, signed by a crop-mark in mountain Pilis (Hungary).

AB  - This contribution reviews the execution of an open source hardware (OSHW) project as part of the Master in Mechatronics Degree Programme at the University of Southern Denmark. There were a number of reasons that motivated us to carry out this project; educational, intellectual and research reasons. Open source projects provide unique opportunities for students to gain experience solving real-world problems. There was also a research consideration in pursuing an OSHW project. Three of the authors of this contribution are working towards a Master's Degree in Innovation and Business and wanted to carry out an OSHW project as a precursor to doing research work on the Commercialization of OSHW Projects. The choice of the project was all important and we choose to build a 3-D printer using information provided by the RepRap Open Source Community because this satisfied nearly all our specifications for an OSHW project. Our experiences in constructing a 3-D printer as well as documenting the areas where the open source information currently has deficiencies are documented here. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - Increasing cross-influence of technology on education and modern pedagogical approaches, could be integrated to act as an academic whole in the universities for the improvement of teaching-learning processes. By means of virtual laboratories, teachers and students can use technological means and web infrastructure to overcome classroom and laboratory limitations in equipment, personnel and space, additionally, by the guidance of correct pedagogical strategies, they can fulfill requirements of the education process not fully covered at classroom, during course time. Through proper design considerations, the operation of a virtual laboratory can be based on open-free hardware and software resources currently being used worldwide and widely known, available without any cost. A structural framework for the implementation of a virtual laboratory on electronic instrumentation to be supported on free-open resources is proposed. The proposed framework shows major economic advantages over other virtual laboratories based on commercial solutions; budget constraints due to high investments in license and proprietary hardware purchases are reduced. Long term sustainability is favored because of the growing worldwide efforts and communities continuously providing support, sharing resources and developing new materials related with the project. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - Secure processors have become increasingly important for trustworthy computing as security breaches escalate. By providing hardware-level protection, a secure processor ensures a safe computing environment where confidential data and applications can be protected against both hardware and software attacks. In this paper, we present a single-chip secure processor model and demonstrate rapid prototyping of the secure processor on the OpenSPARC FPGA platform. OpenSPARC T1 is an industry-grade, open-source, FPGA-synthesizable general-purpose microprocessor originally developed by Sun Microsystems, now acquired by Oracle. It is a multi-core, multi-threaded 64-bit processor with open-source hardware, including the microprocessor core, as well as system software that can be freely modified by researchers. We modify the OpenSPARC T1 processor by adding security modules: an AES engine, a TRNG and a memory integrity tree. These enhancements enable security features like memory encryption and memory integrity verification. By prototyping this single-chip secure processor on the FPGA platform, we find that the OpenSPARC T1 FPGA platform has many advantages for secure processor research. Our prototyping demonstrates that additional modules can be added quickly and easily and they add little resource overhead to the base OpenSPARC processor. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - Embedded systems are a fundamental part of almost all human activities. This, coupled with the availability of free and open software development tools, opens up great possibilities for developing countries as they are not large capital investments needed for the conception, design, and manufacture of these systems. However, currently very few universities offer courses for building the skills necessary to achieve a marketable product, increasing dependence on Asian technology. This paper presents a methodology for teaching embedded system design using open hardware and software tools. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - New open source hardware (OSH) for instrumentation and measurement are appearing regularly as the the OSH community requires more details and prefers that the journals be available online. OSH can provide a backup plan when parts are discontinued and makes it possible to publish a design in journals that specialize in instrumentation. Dr. Dan Steingart, a chemical engineering professor at the City College of New York, plans to publish an open hardware design with a Masters student, and says that such a move is expected to give him academic credit. Version tracking allows the designer to recover previous versions and create branches when major changes are made. Even if there is no OSH design that meets a project's immediate needs, it will help a user to download an OSH project and inspect the structure of the repository and the file types.

AB  - In 1this paper we investigate produsage using Actor-Network Theory with a focus on (produsage) skills, their development, and transformation. We argue that produsage is not a model that determines a change in the traditional consumption/production paradigm through a series of essential preconditions (such as open participation, peer-sharing, or common ownership). Rather, we explain produsage as the open-ended result of a series of heterogeneous actor-networking strategies. In this view, the so-called preconditions do not explain produsage but have to be explained along with its establishment as an actor-network. Drawing on this approach, we discuss a case study of an open hardware project: the Arduino board, and we develop a perspective that maps the skills of human and non-human entities in produsage actor-networks, showing how skills are symmetrical, relational, and circulating. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This paper explores the ways in which digital fabrication allows for the small-scale manufacture and individual customization of consumer electronic products. We present Fab FM, an open-source FM radio that integrates an electronic circuit board, laser-cut wood, and fabric. We describe a workshop in which participants designed and built their own Fab FM variants, modifying the form, materials, and behavior of the radio. Drawing from this experience, we discuss three themes: the issues involved in working across design domains, the ways in which design can serve as source code, and the difference between open-source and hackable. We present potential business models for Fab FM, and discuss the possibilities that digital fabrication offers for a more diverse landscape of high-tech products. © 2011 ACM.

AB  - Recent progress in sensor networks and wireless systems provides serious difficulties to the higher education community for teaching these technologies. The complexity is so high that no practical work content is normally found in the related learning process. In this paper, a novel platform is presented for teaching Bluetooth-based wireless sensor networks and embedded systems. The system is based on a commercial "Open Hardware" device called Openmoko, a personal computer and a suite of software applications, with the objective of introducing a learner-centre approach in aforementioned fields, based on laboratory works in subjects assigned to the Telecommunication Engineering degree and the Electronic Engineering Department of the University of Seville. © IEEE.

AB  - In this paper we describe the implementation of a Linux extension board for the e-puck educational mobile robot, designed to enhance the computation, memory and networking performance of the robot at very low cost. The extension board is based on a 32-bit ARM9 microprocessor and provides wireless network support. The ARM9 extension board runs in parallel with the dsPIC microprocessor on the e-puck motherboard with communication between the two via an SPI bus. The extension board is designed to handle computationally intensive image processing, wireless communication and high-level intelligent robot control algorithms, while the dsPIC handles low-level sensor interfacing, data processing and motor control. The extension board runs an embedded Linux operating system, along with a Debian-based port of the root file system stored in a Micro SD card. The extended e-puck robot platform requires minimal effort to integrate the well-known open-source robot control framework Player and, when placed within a TCP/IP networked infrastructure, provides a powerful and flexible platform for experimental swarm robotics research. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Interactive value creation and especially the open innovation phenomenon have experienced constantly increasing attention during the last years. But hardly any scientific publications are available concerning the topic of open source hardware, a subsection of open innovation. Basic characteristics, like community cooperation or the openness of intellectual property could already be identified as a technological and psychological framework of the phenomenon. Due to broad access to the customers' ability to solve problems and lower commitment of capital in the facilities open source hardware companies can benefit from specific advantages. This article systematically highlights the most important characteristics and illustrates - based on an exploratory study - the upcoming opportunities for designing modern supply chains. © Carl Hanser Verlag, München.

AB  - Based on a survey, we describe the demographic and motivational structure of one open source hardware (OSH) community and compare it to open source software (OSS) communities. Taken separately, both the demographics and the motivational structure of the OSH community fall clearly within the typology of OSS communities, but when the two are taken together the OSH community forms a type of its own. We also discuss bottlenecks in OSH development revealed by the survey and subsequent interviews.

AB  - Recently high-performance sequencers can read whole DNA sequence in short-time. On the other hand, phenotypic information is too short to analyze genomic data. Such phenotypic data will be collected in various environmental conditions (i.e. many places) by long-term observations for individual plants. It can be technologically realized by using low-cost multifunctional sensor networks and free cloud services instantly. We developed OpenFS (Open Field Server) employing open-source hardware. Also free cloud data service such as Twitter is employed to share observed data. Concept of ambient sensor cloud system is proposed by using both OpenFS and cloud computing. © 2011 SICE.

AB  - This paper describes a capstone project whose objective was to design, build and successfully test an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with real-time video surveillance capabilities. The student team was composed of seven students within an aeronautical concentration of their Mechanical Engineering Technology program. The students designed and built a UAV capable of flying under direct manual control and indirect automatic control. Direct manual control was accomplished via a model radio-control transmitter, while indirect control accomplished via the onboard autopilot system. Programmable autonomous flight software, utilizing global positioning satellites (GPS), controls the autopilot system. A ground control station (GCS) sends and receives telemetry from a 2.4GHz modem located in the UAV. The GCS utilized Paparazzi, an open-source hardware and software autopilot platform, which allows mission specific flight plans to be created, uploaded, and executed and monitored during the UAV's flight. Real-time video from the UAV is transmitted to the GCS via an antenna and receiver. This comprehensive design and build project, concluding with successful test flights, enhanced the student learning and performance during the course of the project. Assessment data gathered by the project faculty mentor are provided in the paper. © 2011 American Society for Engineering Education.

AB  - Teaching and learning programming with a traditional classroom/ lab-based approach is challenging. Students often struggle to learn program due to lack of extensive hands-on practice and sufficient time to become familiar with programming concept. In this paper we report on an action research study of students' exploration and use of previously unexplored low-cost open-source mobile devices for learning programming. The study was conducted over a period of 14 weeks in University of West London, UK, with the postgraduate students studying Mobile Application Development (MAD) module which is a part of the MSc Network and Mobile Computing course. We introduced the Wikireader, a handheld reading device, and Nanonote, a lightweight pocket computer. In this study, we used mixed methods research methodology and data analysis was guided by the Framework for the Rational Analysis of Mobile Education (FRAME) model. The results of our evaluations indicate open-source devices have potential to enhance motivation to learn programming without being restricted to the limited practical sessions in the university lab and also facilitate offline reading.

AB  - There is growing student interest in renewable energy and electric vehicles. Energy storage is a critical technology for electric vehicles and to some extent for intermittent renewable energy sources. Battery life, performance, and cost remain a barrier to widespread use of battery energy storage. Increasing the number of students researching these technologies would increase the likelihood of progress. The process of testing batteries to characterize performance and durability typically requires the use of specialized equipment that may be beyond the budget for many educators. Hence, many interested students may not have access to the tools to perform these experiments. To remedy this, we have begun the development of an open source battery-testing platform that can be built at a fraction of the cost of commercial systems. Furthermore, the development of the testing platform provides educational opportunities for students. © 2011 American Society for Engineering Education.

AB  - In this paper, we present a prototype of a spatially resolved force sensing floor surface. The force sensors are based on conductive paper and grouped into modules called tacTiles. Due to the cheap and widely available materials used for tacTiles, the approach is suitable as a low-cost alternative for spatially resolved tactile sensing. The necessary techniques are shared as an open source and open hardware project to provide an affordable tactile sensing for smart environments. As an interactive application of these tacTiles, we present a detection of step direction algorithm used to count steps into and out of a room. © 2010 ACM.

AB  - With the growing interest of cloud computing and carbon emission reduction, how to build energy efficient cloud architecture becomes a crisis issue for service providers. In this paper, we propose a power-aware cloud architecture based on DRBL (Diskless Remote Boot in Linux), cpufreqd and xenpm. We also introduce a low-cost smart metering system based on open hardware Arduino board. Composing with existing technique, such as Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling (DVFS), ACPI, diskless design and RAM disk storage, our experiment results show that this architecture will reduce energy consumption from 4 to 11% when running CPUintensive applications. In conclusion, this paper reveals that service providers could benefit from diskless design and RAM disk storage if their applications are CPU-intensive. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - During code review tasks, comparing two versions of a hardware design description using existing program differencing tools such as diff is inherently limited because existing program differencing tools implicitly assume sequential execution semantics, while hardware description languages are designed to model concurrent computation. We designed a position-independent differencing algorithm to robustly handle language constructs whose relative orderings do not matter. This paper presents Vdiff, an instantiation of this position-independent differencing algorithm for Verilog HDL. To help programmers reason about the differences at a high-level, Vdiff outputs syntactic differences in terms of Verilog-specific change types. We evaluated Vdiff on two open source hardware design projects. The evaluation result shows that Vdiff is very accurate, with overall 96.8% precision and 97.3% recall when using manually classified differences as a basis of comparison. © 2010 ACM.

AB  - The development model of Open Source Software (OSS) has been widely recognized as resilient and productive. Consequently, high hopes have been placed on projects that try to adapt the OSS model into material production, in projects that can be called Open Source Hardware (OSH). While OSS development has received increasing scholarly attention, the research on OSH is still in its early stages. Here, based on a survey done in 2010, we describe the demographic and motivational structure of one OSH community and compare it to OSS communities. The community analysis will be accompanied with a short discussion of what we see as bottlenecks in OSH development, i.e., features that may disable some of the beneficial dynamics of OSS development, and consequently merit further study. © 2010 ACM.

AB  - This paper presents the guidelines for building a low-cost network suitable for power-quality monitoring. The implementation of a standalone basic node capable of extracting various power-quality metrics (Total Harmonic Distortion-THD, Crest Factor, etc) in an open-source hardware embedded system board is described. By utilizing simple signal processing techniques directly in hardware, this node maintains high portability due to its small dimensions. Furthermore, exploitation of its built-in TCP/IP capabilities allows the deployment of a wide area network by the interconnection of basic nodes, in order to provide power-quality data collection for further processing and evaluation. Due to the distributed processing load, the proposed network can achieve high efficiency and reliability.

AB  - The use of customizable open-source software and affordable low-power open-hardware devices can help in building personalized connected-home applications. Open hardware, such as the BeagleBoard-xM and HawkBoard development boards, along with open software, such as the GeeXboX uShare media server and the XBMC media center, give developers the control to create an individualized, cost-efficient, and expandable system that allows them to quickly close the feature gap between the available and the desired solution. A networked media server can act as the basis of connected home applications and lets the owner share media among multiple local or remote network devices. The use of an an open platform with the right performance, peripherals, and connectivity options in combination with the appropriate open-source software will allow developers to join communities of other developers working jointly, to solve a shared set of problems.

AB  - We present a lab kit platform based on an Arduino microcontroller board and open hardware that enables students to use low-cost, course specific hardware to complete lab exercises at home. The platform is designed to be accessible to a wide range of students and easily adapted for other applications. Careful hardware selection allows existing laboratory exercises to be modified for use with the platform, and the platform enables new exercises that would not be possible in a traditional lab. We describe the adoption of these kits in a course designed for on-campus and remote students that teaches the science and technology of modern display systems. We find that the platform delivers a consistent, high quality laboratory experience for both on-campus and remote students. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - The aim of this work is to present a novel, low cost, reliable methodology to create and control an interactive Virtual Reality model of an Integrated Manufacturing Cell (IMC) for education and training. The presented approach is built upon open software and open hardware. Users can create computer graphics using CAD/CAM tools and they can interact with the Virtual Reality IMC scene using head mounted displays and haptic devices. Furthermore, the whole system can be controlled using real, non-expensive devices such as Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) and devices to communicate to the computer. The proposed virtual reality IMC can be used to enhance undergraduate courses of Manufacture, Industrial Networks as well as creating training systems for industrial environments so users can understand how machines and robots work and interact within an IMC. In addition this project can be used on public schools for the undeveloped countries, where only a computer and a low cost PLC are needed.

AB  - ANIMA has as a primary objective to compare three non-conventional human computer interfaces that comply with the industrial robot ST Robotics R-17 instructions. This module, Alpha Waves Related Potentials -ARP- explains how brain waves are obtained, processed, analyzed and identified depending on their frequency. This module makes use of the Open EEG Project's open hardware monitor for brain wave activity, called the modular EEG. The brain waves are obtained through an electrode cap complying with the international 10-20 system for electrode positioning. The brain waves are processed with a fast Fourier transform using a micro-controller and analyzed in software identifying the alpha wave's contribution. A program identifies the amount of time that alpha wave generation was maintained through concentration, and instructions are sent to the robotic arm, executing one of four pre-defined routines. Thirty percent of the users attained control over the robotic arm with the human computer interface. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Current Analog Telephone Adaptors (ATA) which are commonly used by small business and home offices to implement Internet telephony applications are designed to work with an audio bandwidth of 300 Hz to 3.4 KHz, a holdover from the one hundred year history of telephone companies trying to accommodate a high volume of calls over copper. Recent network improvements in the last decade allow for a wider bandwidth. However, existing work in wideband audio for telephony has been mainly focused either on mobile telephony or high end teleconferencing equipment but not on ATA devices. This paper proposes improvements to ATA devices that allow an audio bandwidth of 50 Hz to 7 KHz. An implementation is discussed where a minimal upgrade to an open source ATA based on GPL licensed hardware is modified to support wideband, and a middleware layer software is modified to also handle the wider bandwidth. Moreover, promising results when using the modified hardware and software were obtained. The results indicated that with slight CPU overloading, the modified hardware and software can be used for wideband telephony. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - This paper examines the distribution, adoption, and evolution of an open-source toolkit we developed called the LilyPad Arduino. We track the two-year history of the kit and its user community from the time the kit was commercially introduced, in October of 2007, to November of 2009. Using sales data, publicly available project documentation and surveys, we explore the relationship between the LilyPad and its adopters. We investigate the community of developers who has adopted the kit - -paying special attention to gender - -explore what people are building with it, describe how user feedback impacted the development of the kit and examine how and why people are contributing their own LilyPad-inspired tools back to the community. What emerges is a portrait of a new technology and a new engineering/design community in co-evolution. © 2010 ACM.

AB  - In developing countries, mobile devices can play an important role in delivering learning. But, poor information infrastructure and higher costs of mobile devices and connectivity restrict possibilities of providing successful mobile learning services. In the field of Information Communication for Development (ICT4D), this research aims to highlight the possible role of previously unexplored open hardware platforms for delivering affordable and sustainable mobile learning offline. This paper points out the technical challenge of using open hardware and need for a broader study to investigate its potential role in developing countries as supporting mobile learners in their own socio-cultural contexts is a significant challenge. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - Requirements for modern and future control systems for large projects like International Linear Collider demand high availability for control system components. Recently telecom industry came up with a great open hardware specification Advanced Telecom Computing Architecture (ATCA). This specification is aimed for better reliability, availability and serviceability. Since its first market appearance in 2004, ATCA platform has shown tremendous growth and proved to be stable and well represented by a number of vendors. ATCA is an industry standard for highly available systems. On the other hand Service Availability Forum, a consortium of leading communications and computing companies, describes interaction between hardware and software. SAF defines a set of specifications such as Hardware Platform Interface, Application Interface Specification. SAF specifications provide extensive description of highly available systems, services and their interfaces. Originally aimed for telecom applications, these specifications can be used for accelerator controls software as well. This study describes benefits of using these specifications and their possible adoption to accelerator control systems. It is demonstrated how EPICS Redundant IOC was extended using Hardware Platform Interface specification, which made it possible to utilize benefits of the ATCA platform. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The proposed system proved to be capable of digitizing real occurrences of impulse noise. The goal is to use such system in large scale measurement campaigns, and then derive stochastic models for behavioral description of impulse noise. These models will provide better methods to reduce impulse noise effects, ever improving the quality of service in digital subscriber line transmissions. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - This gesture recognizer, developed by students in a third-year microprocessor-based laboratory course, takes Wii remote (Wiimote) as an input device to estimate the movements of the user and to compare the detected trajectory with the previously learnt movements, in order to carry out the associated actions. Such a cheap state-of-the-art wireless user interface is very attractive for the students and can be used in many interactive applications, from robotics to virtual reality and multimedia presentations. By combining commercially-available hardware, pattern-matching techniques and programming skills, we are able to foster students' interest on developing innovative potentially-marketable systems. This freeware project, implemented as a configurable publicly-available library, can be adapted to the needs of any course or student. In our laboratory this open-source DLL is used for remotely controlling a robot (based on an open-hardware Arduino platform), using a PC and the Wiimote, although the DLL can be integrated in any C, C++, Java or C# project. A GUI application (based on a Model-View-Presenter paradigm) is also provided and can be used as a template for new applications or just for debugging purposes. Although the developed application only uses data from the accelerometers, data from the infrared camera and buttons of the Wiimote is also available. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - Recent reviews show large failure rates in the commercialization of new product designs. Often, the reason of failure has been not a lack of technological capability of the firm, but a wrong understanding of customer preferences. Extending the concept of adaptable smart products, our concept of "embedded toolkits for user co-design" proposes to design products with build-in flexibility by embedding knowledge and rules about possible product differentiations into the product. This approach can be seen as a scalable attempt towards "open hardware", extending the open innovation paradigm beyond software towards tangible products. Users are enabled to modify a product directly according to their individual needs. We present a technology acceptance study (TAM) of such an embedded toolkit in an automobile. Surveying 163 users demonstrates the general feasibility and value drivers of embedded toolkits. Our paper contributes to the literature by discussing the contingency factors and the tactical and strategic implications of embedded open toolkits for user innovation. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - This book is about the Arduino microcontroller and the Arduino concept. The visionary Arduino team of Massimo Banzi, David Cuartielles, Tom Igoe, Gianluca Martino, and David Mellis launched a new innovation in microcontroller hardware in 2005, the concept of open source hardware. Their approach was to openly share details of microcontroller-based hardware design platforms to stimulate the sharing of ideas and promote innovation. This concept has been popular in the software world for many years. This book is intended for a wide variety of audiences including students of the fine arts, middle and senior high school students, engineering design students, and practicing scientists and engineers. To meet this wide audience, the book has been divided into sections to satisfy the need of each reader. The book contains many software and hardware examples to assist the reader in developing a wide variety of systems. For the examples, the Arduino Duemilanove and the Atmel ATmega328 is employed as the target processor. Copyright © 2010 by Morgan & Claypool.

AB  - Moving object segmentation plays an important role in a complex object tracking system. This system decides whether the current block belongs to the object region or not. In this article, a scheme using background modeling based on runtime-weighted features for robustly adaptive moving object segmentation in infrared (IR) image sequence is proposed. Proposed background modeling for an open hardware (HAV) architecture design decreases the size of the search area to construct a sparse block template of search area in infrared images. The authors also compensate for motion compensation when the image moves in previous and current frames of IR imaging system. The method of separation of background and objects applies to adaptive values through time analysis of pixel intensity. The proposed method uses more feature information such as intensity, deviation, block matching error, and velocity. The weighting values give a higher weight to feature information which has a large difference between the object and the background region. Based on experimental results, the proposed method showed real-time moving object segmentation through background modeling in the proposed embedded system. ©2010 Society for Imaging Science and Technology:.

AB  - Human health is a priority for every country, unfortunately in undeveloped countries where Obesity and Hypertension disorders are increasing every year, the amount of unattended heart patients is growing up as well. Due to the lack of enough sanitary services, great efforts are been done to attend disabled, low incomes or rural population; nevertheless, there are still a great amount of work to do. Arduino is an open-hardware, Bluetooth wireless communication, single microcontroller, multiple I/O platform, used in this project to interface our Electrocardioagram (ECG) signal conditioning circuit to the computer, where, a Matlab program filters the signal, displays the ECG and, by means of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), is able to establish if the user is healthy, or is presenting Arrhythmia, Left bundle branch block or Right bundle branch block. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a low cost, open-hardware ECG system, which is able to diagnose among a finite number heart diseases, the systems keeps track of the user measurements and is able to log on a medical institution web site to update the clinical records of the patient. Such a system may be used for the benefit of that sector of the population whit limited sanitary services access. Artificial intelligence diagnosis, Open-Hardware ECG.

AB  - NYC Resistor, a communal hacker space in Brooklyn, NY, developed the Barbot Series, the electronic bartender. Barbot Series v3 is the third incarnation of the electronic bartender in which the brain is a configurable Twitchie microcontroller board. The Twitchie is based on the Arduino platform, a collection of development tools based on open source hardware designs and software. The Twitchie variant of Arduino has at its heart an Atmega168 chip running the Arduino coding environment and optimized to drive servos. The robot starts moving the drink from one filling station to the next so that alcohol, mixers, and bitters can be added in succession. At the first station, a servo-controlled arm swings out and delivers alcohol to the glass in exact measures, through hoses made from 1/4-inch tubing, using peristaltic pumps with bearings which when turn put revolving pressure on a tube and force liquids onward. In the next station, the mixers are gravity-fed from the top of the machine and measured with precisely timed 12-volt solenoid valves which let the liquid into the drink.

AB  - This work presents an on-going project that consists in providing low-cost telephony services in remote areas in the Amazon region, North Brazil. The idea is to build GSM networks using open-source and open-hardware projects, such as: OpenBTS, Openmoko, IP04, Asterisk and USRP. The NavegaPará Program, which currently connects thirteen cities in the state, provides the backbone network with optical fiber and digital radios. This paper summarizes the project and discusses the strategy adopted to circumvent a specific problem: the establishment of know-how on GSM technologies among engineering (electrical and computer) students. Several handson experiments in GSM technologies are being currently used and some are described here. For example, the work discusses how the Matlab toolkit GSMsim can be used to analyze digitized GSM waveforms. It also describes the development of a QAM modulator for better understanding the basics of GNU Radio. The success of the project will be measured by the effect in the life of citizens who, currently, do not have any access to a phone for basic communication needs. © 2009 IEEE.

AB  - In this article, we introduce our recent development of small-sized experimental devices for control research and education, with a special focus on the use of open-source technologies such as Arduino and Processing. Arduino is a pronominal open-source hardware whose architecture, implementation and other necessary resources are accessible to every users, while Processing is its software counterpart which supports rapid development of controller/interface programs without much expertise. We demonstrate their advantage with a kinematic nonholonomic system called the trident snake robot and an under-actuated mechanical system called the inverted unicycle robot.

AB  - Pattern matching is the critical part in Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). Fast pattern matching algorithm is the key to improve the system performance. In this paper, a fast reverse pattern matching algorithm and the hardware implementation suitable with Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) are proposed. Taking advantage of the parallelism and programmability of FPGA, this design reduces the pattern match delay greatly. This design is implemented in a NetFPGA platform, which is an open hardware platform optimized for high-speed network. The parallel pattern matching system provides a high throughput of 4 Gbps with no data loss, which proves the information processing rate of this design. © 2009 IEEE.

All the software design has been made in a PC platform using standard development tools. The source code generated for the protocol has been compiled with the standard Linux gcc compiler in LEON. Several tests have been made to prove that the RTU works correctly. ©2009 IEEE.

AB  - This paper describes the High Bandwidth High Throughput (HBHT) Government Reference Architecture (GRA) effort and utilization of Dependency Structure Matrix (DSM) tools to validate the architecture. This paper is intended to show how the development of GRA compliant modules advances both new and time-tested technologies through establishing a standard for Above 2 GHz SATCOM Terminal modules. The paper will also describe plans to develop and apply tools, products and solutions to validate the GRA. The paper describes the process associated with engaging industry in developing the GRA Functional Decomposition, validating the GRA through a prototype, creating the GRA as a standard for the Army HC3 Program, and managing to that architecture and standard in a development environment. The paper also describes how GRA validation through use of DSM tools, such as LATTIX, will aid in the development and testing of a GRA Hardware and Software Interface Test Development Environment designed to allow a GRA module developer to develop, interface, and test interface applications to the GRA compatible open hardware/software interfaces. Full documentation shall be developed for all open hardware and software interfaces, sufficient to develop applications with minimum interface or interaction with the module developer. Interface definition stability over time will be a key factor in the mission success of the HC3 open system interfaces, so they must be designed with stability and longevity in mind. This paper will review alternatives for validation of GRA compliant modules. Particular emphasis will be placed on DSM techniques. The interdependencies between modules will be modeled using a DSM so as to provide a big picture view of GRA. DSM can also be used to model and expose key design decisions for the entire team. Rules can be established in the DSM model for GRA compliance to guide a GRA module developer during development and testing for validation. The use of DSM to model various hardware and software modules in the HBHT will create a common artifact that can be shared across various teams with different skills and domains of expertise. DSM can also be used to analyze the impact of change. Over time, DSM will provide a blue print of the architecture and how it evolves to meet changing needs. © 2009 IEEE.

AB  - In today's society, collaboration between individuals and groups thousands of miles away has become increasingly common place. Due primarily to the rapid growth of broadband internet, cheap data storage and fast microchip technology, a new frontier has been opened where engineers and scientists can quickly and efficiently share large amounts of information with colleagues all across the globe. The implications of this technology have been and continue to become increasingly influential on the evolution of not just the sciences, but humanity as a whole. This paper will survey current successes that have been seen in open source software development and the emergent 'open design' realm. From here, parallels are drawn between the two disciplines to illustrate how engineering organizations can benefit from the highly distributed nature that open source software has implemented. In this light, this paper will establish the position that engineering design must make the shift towards a more open and collaborative environment to stay relevant and prosper in the Information Age. Additionally, a basic web framework detailing the technologies needed to see such a shift occur will be outlined. Currently, there is some research being done in this area, but overall the possibilities for growth and innovation are significant.

AB  - Open source appropriate technology (OSAT) refers to technologies that provide for sustainable development while being designed in the same fashion as free and open-source software. Facilitated by advances in information technology software and hardware, new ways to disseminate information such as wikis and Internet-enabled mobile phones, the global development of OSAT has emerged as a reality. This paper shows the sharing of design processes, appropriate tools, and technical information is enables more effective and rapid development of appropriate technologies for both industrialized and non-industrialized regions. This sharing will require the appropriate technology community to adopt open standards/licenses, document knowledge, and build on previous work. This paper offers solutions in the form of both business models and tools to overcome technical constraints of OSAT development in the forms of the platforms necessary on which to share and build knowledge about appropriate technologies. These solutions are open, easily accessible for those in need, have a low barrier to entry for both users and information creators, and must be vetted in order to utilized as a trustworthy source on critical information needs. Current progress towards implementing these solutions will be reviewed and recommendations will be made to further increase the rate of OSAT development. ©2009 IEEE.

AB  - The NetFPGA platform is designed to enable students and researchers to build networking systems that run at line-rate, and to create re-usable designs to share with others. Our goal is to eventually create a thriving developer-community, where developers around the world contribute reusable modules and designs for the benefit of the community as a whole. To this end, we have created a repository of "User Contributed Designs" at NetFPGA.org. But creating an "open-source hardware" platform is quite different from software oriented open-source projects. Designing hardware is much more time consuming - and more error prone - than designing software, and so demands a process that is more focussed on verifying that a module really works as advertised, else others will be reluctant to use it. We have designed a novel process for contributing new designs. Each contributed design is specified entirely by a set of tests it passes. A developer includes a list of tests that their design will pass, along with an executable set of tests that the user can check against. Through this process, we hope to establish the right expectations for someone who reuses a design, and to encourage sound design practices with solid, repeatable and integrated testing. In this paper we describe the philosophy behind our process, in the hope that others may learn from it, as well as describe the details of how someone contributes a new design to the NetFPGA repository. ©2009 IEE.

AB  - This article introduces a computer numerical control (CNC)-based open hardware architecture system to realize the special functions of automated tape-laying (ATL) in a numerical control system. It associates a programmable multi-axis controller (PMAC) as the motion control unit with programmable numerical controllers (PCL-725, PCL-730) for on-off control. To bring about synchronized movements of the main 5-axis tape-laying head system and the 3-axis ultrasonic tape-cutting sub-system, the tracking-control method associated with time-based mode attributed to PMAC is applied in different cases. In addition, with the goal of realizing real-time tasks in the software system such as synchronizing motion control and on-off control, the real-time Win 2000 system is adopted. As a device driver for PMAC and PCL, a user graphical interface and a numerical control program interpretation module are also designed. This system is helpful to solve complicated problems in designing numerical controls for ATL such as ensuring high requirements for precise machine control and synchronization of motion control and on-off control. © 2009 Chinese Journal of Aeronautics.

AB  - This paper revisits the problem of the readiness for field deployments of wireless sensor networks by assessing the relevance of using Open Hardware and Software motes for environment monitoring. We propose a new prototype wireless sensor network that finetunes SquidBee motes to improve the life-time and sensing performance of an environment monitoring system that measures temperature, humidity and luminosity. Building upon two outdoor sensing scenarios, we evaluate the performance of the newly proposed energy-aware prototype solution in terms of link quality when expressed by the Received Signal Strength, Packet Loss and the battery lifetime. The experimental results reveal the relevance of using the Open Hardware and Software motes when setting up outdoor wireless sensor networks. © 2009 by the authors; licensee Molecular Diversity Preservation International, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - To enable the open architecture Computer Numerical Control (CNC) system to be independent of specific hardware and software platforms, the NC pipeline architecture was proposed. The pipeline architecture was consisted of a NC pipeline thread, a driver and a NC Microcode Processor (NCMP). The NC Canonical Command (NCCC) interface and the NC Microcode (NCM) interface were defined to ensure the inter-changeability of different modules and the reconfiguration of the pipeline. The primary control functions from code interpretation to NCM generation were encapsulated in the NC pipeline thread. Standard programming interface and software development techniques were employed to guarantee the portability of the NC pipeline thread. The NCMP utilized reconfigurable open hardware to execute the NCM and perform the real-time control functions. The non-real-time section and real-time section of the NC pipeline was isolated by the NCM buffer. The experiment showed that the NC pipeline architecture was applicable to a wide range of general hardware and software platforms, and it provided a practical approach to construct open architecture CNC systems.

AB  - We have designed and built a new open hardware/ software board that lets miniaturized robots communicate and at the same time obtain the range and bearing of the source of emission. The open E-puck Range & Bearing board improves an existing infrared relative localization/communication software library (libIrcom) developed for the e-puck robot and based on its on-board infrared sensors. The board allows the robots to have an embodied, decentralized and scalable communication system. Its use and capabilities are demonstrated via an alignment experiment. © 2009 IEEE.

AB  - The concept of Wearable Computing can be used to support work processes of mobile workers e.g. in a factory environment or outdoors. The basis is a wireless network for an ubiquituous remote access to information. In the paper we explain the potential of Wearable Computing and focus on the technological challenges. During the last five years (2004 till 2009) the EC funded the worldwide largest project on Wearable Computing: wearIT@work (www.wearitatwork.com). The project did not focus on new technologies. However, with existing technologies new applications were developed. For new user groups of mobile workers a new quality of support had to be achieved. The paper reports at the end of the project on the main findings and lessons learned: An open hardware platform, an open software framework and for seven different application domains solutions were developed. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Fertilizer application in the sowing rows does not necessarily increase crop yields, but it does increase the variability of the soil chemical properties, particularly of the nutrients P and K. This variability is greater in the no-tillage system because there is no homogenization of the soil surface layer. This study evaluated the effect of fertilization strategies on soil chemical properties at distinct soil depths after three and six years from the beginning of the experiment in a Haplohumox under long-term no-tillage. Besides, the variation of these properties considering two methods of soil sampling, with and without inclusion of the seeding row, was evaluated. Ten treatments were applied, nine considering P sources (rock phosphate and triple superphosphate), row preparation equipment (double disc opener and coulter opener), fertilizer placement (in-row and broadcast), time of application (summer and winter) and one control treatment, without fertilizer. The measured soil chemical properties were higher in the surface layers and depth distribution, except for P, was not influenced by the fertilization strategies. The soil P values were the lowest in the 0-5 cm layer where the coulter opener equipment had been continuously used for more than three years and no fertilizer was applied. With the inclusion of the sowing row in the soil sampling, higher K, Ca and CEC values were observed. The methodologies of soil sampling, with and without the inclusion of the sowing row and the 0-10 and 0-20 cm sampling layers resulted in similar fertilizer and lime recommendations for areas under long-term no-tillage.

AB  - This paper presents the design of a complete RTU (Remote Terminal Unit) with a System-on-Chip solution based completely on both open hardware and software platforms, and developed in conjunction with two industrial companies. The target implementation of the embedded system is a Spartan family FPGA from Xilinx. The article presents the main features of the base system, which consists of the LEON microprocessor and a Linux operating system distribution (Debian) running on it. Moreover, it shows a complete example of how to add new peripherals to the system. The peripheral that has been added is the UART 16550 compatible peripheral available in OpenCores. Given that the design has been prepared for the WishBone bus, it was necessary to adapt it to the APB bus within the LEON core. Furthermore, it has been adapted to work with the Linux driver for that UART to get a full coupling of peripheral with the system. The experimental results confirm the work done. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - Satellite based navigation is a rapidly growing application of satellite systems. The research of the topic is lacking "open source" hardware receivers. Our group's purpose is to provide one. In this paper we outline the background to the topic, motivate the need for hardware receiver research and present the functional blocks for a generic GNSS receiver. Our implementations, with their current status, are presented and the initial block-by-block functionality is presented along the signal chain from antenna to the actual navigation solution. Our future work will be the connection of the currently discrete pieces to a solid framework - a real-time GNSS receiver. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - Immersive environments offer significant potential for engaging users in new ways of receiving information and learning. Although, commercial head-eye trackers offer advantages when compared to Open Source Software (OSS) solutions, their use for research presents the same problem as many proprietary software and hardware: restricted access to data and protocols. To overcome these problems, this paper describes the development of OSS which was designed to be used with either commercial or open source hardware. Particular focus was on designing the software from the ground up, to work with immersive environments. As a result, the Point of Regard (PoR) head-eye tracking software uses an open source library which takes as data input a users' head position, head orientation and eye data from any device giving the freedom to the developer for manipulating the resulting combined data. © 2008 IADIS.

AB  - An analog VLSI hardware architecture for the distributed simulation of large-scale spiking neural networks has been developed. Several hundred integrated computing nodes, each hosting up to 512 neurons, will be interconnected and operated on un-cut silicon wafers. The electro-technical aspects and the details of the hardware implementation are covered in a separate contribution to this conference. This paper focuses on the usability of the system by demonstrating that biologically relevant network models can in fact be mapped to this system. Different network configurations are established on the hardware by programmable switch matrices, repeaters, and address decoders. Systematic routing algorithms are presented to map a given network model to the hardware system. Routing is simulated for several network examples, proving the system's practical applicability. Furthermore, the routing simulations are used to fix values for yet open hardware parameters. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - Simultaneous recording of electrophysiology and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a technique of growing importance in neuroscience. Rapidly evolving clinical and scientific requirements have created a need for hardware and software that can be customized for specific applications. Hardware may require customization to enable a variety of recording types (e.g., electroencephalogram, local field potentials, or multi-unit activity) while meeting the stringent and costly requirements of MRI safety and compatibility. Real-time signal processing tools are an enabling technology for studies of learning, attention, sleep, epilepsy, neurofeedback, and neuropharmacology, yet real-time signal processing tools are difficult to develop. We describe an open-source system for simultaneous electrophysiology and fMRI featuring low-noise (<0.6 μV p-p input noise), electromagnetic compatibility for MRI (tested up to 7 T), and user-programmable real-time signal processing. The hardware distribution provides the complete specifications required to build an MRI-compatible electrophysiological data acquisition system, including circuit schematics, print circuit board (PCB) layouts, Gerber files for PCB fabrication and robotic assembly, a bill of materials with part numbers, data sheets, and vendor information, and test procedures. The software facilitates rapid implementation of real-time signal processing algorithms. This system has been used in human EEG/fMRI studies at 3 and 7 T examining the auditory system, visual system, sleep physiology, and anesthesia, as well as in intracranial electrophysiological studies of the non-human primate visual system during 3 T fMRI, and in human hyperbaric physiology studies at depths of up to 300 feet below sea level.

AB  - In this paper we describe a localization and local communication system which allows situated agents to communicate locally, obtaining at the same time both the range and the bearing of the emitter without the need of any centralized control or any external reference. The system relies on infrared communications with frequency modulation and is composed of two interconnected modules for data and power measurement. Thanks to the open hardware license under which it is released, the research community can easily replicate the system at a low cost and/or adapt it for applications in sensor networks and in robotics. © 2008 by the authors.

AB  - Methods to determine cytokine protein content in samples of interest, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), are often labor-intensive and costly. Furthermore, because ELISA requires relatively large sample volumes and protein concentrations, it is difficult using this technique to determine protein content for multiple cytokines from individual samples. Recently, Luminex has developed an open source hardware platform combining flow cytometry- and bead-based antibody capture that is capable of detecting multiple analytes from a single sample. In the present study we employed the Luminex 200® platform to determine the cytokine protein content in discrete brain regions of C57BL/6J mice. In spike-and-recovery experiments, known concentrations of murine recombinant interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α were added either singly or as a mixture of all three to whole brain homogenates containing known quantities of total protein. Spiked samples were assayed for either a single cytokine or for multiple cytokines using 1-plex or 3-plex assay kits, respectively. In whole mouse brain homogenate we recovered between 81% and 103% of the recombinant cytokines. We then injected C57BL/6J mice intraperitoneally with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and sacrificed them 4 h later. We detected in samples taken from LPS-stimulated mice 4- to 870-fold increases in serum or spleen cytokine protein, and 1.5- to 16-fold increases in cytokine protein in discrete brain regions, relative to protein content in samples obtained from vehicle-treated animals. These results indicate that multiple cytokines may be reliably assayed from discrete regions of mouse brain using a single sample. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Due to the complexity of multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) wireless channels, direct measurement is the main viable option for accurate characterization. Details on a new low-cost wideband channel sounder are presented, which was mainly constructed from conventional instruments and components. This switched architecture system is similar to commercial channel sounders and has modest cost (< US$ 50000). The sounder operates in the 2- to 8-GHz range with up to 100 MHz of instantaneous bandwidth and supports eight transmitters and receivers, which are sufficient to support the development and assessment of current and future MIMO wireless systems. In this "open-hardware"project, the hardware design and software components are openly available to other researchers interested in developing or enhancing the MIMO measurement capability. The actual systems built at the University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa, and Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, are presented, as are some example studies. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - The last developments of the home gateways, DSL-boxes, off-the-shelf wireless routers, wireless communities initiatives have brought a great number of network hardware to the home. These different developments have been followed by different initiatives of "hacking the box" to be able to flash this specific hardware with open-source firmware resulting from the contribution of several open-source developers (OpenWrt, Frei-funk...). Due to the lack of "open hardware" off-the-shelf available to adjust the platform to the home-networking (and networking) applications, Open-Pattern is a project to develop such a hardware based on the inputs from the past initiatives and bringing a box based on an open hardware (i.e. open specifications of the targeted hardware), using a motherboard and able to receive daughterboard to expand the functionalities in conjunction with the current open source project to be using the box once this one is ready to be shipped. © 2008 by International Federation for lnfonnation Processing.

AB  - A simple digital receiver named "GNU Radio Beacon Receiver (GRBR)" was developed for the satelliteground beacon experiment to measure the ionospheric total electron content (TEC). The open-source software toolkit for the software defined radio, GNU Radio, is utilized to realize the basic function of the receiver and perform fast signal processing. The software is written in Python for a LINUX PC. The open-source hardware called Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP), which best matches the GNU Radio, is used as a frontend to acquire the satellite beacon signals of 150 and 400 MHz. The first experiment was successful as results from GRBR showed very good agreement to those from the co-located analog beacon receiver.

AB  - A current trend in learning programs, even at high-degree studies, is applying the concepts of "learning by projects". In this context, the LEGO® MINDSTORMS® NXT modular robot appears as a simple, flexible and attractive educational platform to achieve the referred challenge in many domains of information technologies, especially in real-time control. The project team can operate with the real system (e.g. constructed robot) to realize a number of particular tasks. The ready-to-use embedded platform and dual microcontrollers architecture represents actual trends in the modern control systems designs. The open hardware and software architecture gives unlimited possibility to handle all devices connected to the main control brick and write effective control algorithms. The proposed rescue robot project is a good example of the simple system where, a number of real-time control problems can be analyzed. The project on this scale requires detailed planning, cooperation in teams, extensive literature survey, and comprehensive software design. That is exactly, what we need for "learning by projects" concept. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing of automotive control systems is a very mature methodology. Yet there are a number of reasons why it has not yet seen wide proliferation in the commercial vehicle industry. First, until recently, hardware-in-the-loop testing required the use of expensive special-purpose hardware solutions to achieve the needed real-time performance. Second, the development of highly accurate real-time-capable models of diesel engines, transmissions and complete vehicles was prohibitively labor-intensive. Third, the development of test cases required special programming skills. Fourth, the test cases were not portable from one controller program to the next, which limited their re-use. In recent years the performance and user-friendliness of commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and software products have changed to the point that they can now be used in very complex and sophisticated HIL test systems for automobiles and commercial vehicles. As a result, these next generation HIL systems are Built on open hardware and software architectures derived from PCs. This reduces long-term cost of ownership by a substantial amount. Capable of running simulation tools and plant models from many different origins and vendors in real-time. This reduces the effort in developing high-fidelity real-time models for the purpose of HIL testing by a large amount. Capable of running test cases that are implemented in such a way that they can be re-used across many controller programs and across different test benches. This paper will provide details on the three points made above. It will show how one can implement HIL testers for commercial vehicle applications based on COTS hardware and software. It will also show how one can re-use non-real-time plant models for HIL testing. Finally, it will show how one can develop test cases that are language independent, controller program independent, and test bench independent. Copyright © 2008 SAE International.

AB  - Power consumption is a hot topic, however using CPU designs from the world of battery powered devices, and flash memory based storage we can make cool systems. A Millicomputer is defined as a computer that uses less than one watt, so its power is specified in milliWatts. Enterprise Millicomputer clusters provide large numbers of small computing units at an aggregate cost, performance and power level that redefines the limits of what is possible. Initial Millicomputer systems are being constructed as open source hardware by their end users. This paper describes the architecture, capacity characteristics, and applications of Enterprise Millicomputers. The Future of Computing is Open Hardware by the milliWatt!

AB  - In this paper, we present a platform for system on chip (SoC) implementation that is suitable for telecommunication applications. To build the platform, we have adopted the OpenCores-Openhardware design concept. The benefit of using the OpenCores methodology is flexibility, reuse and accessibility of the cores at free cost. We demonstrate how the open hardware trend can help designers to build complex integrated circuits such as SoCs at low cost. To test the platform, our first application is a SoC implementation of a Voice Over IP (VoIP) Gateway. The first preliminary results show that the whole SoC can be implemented in the field programmable gate array (FPGA) - XC2V1000 circuit. ©2007 IEEE.

AB  - We propose an open hardware and software architecture for the cooperative coordination of multiple mobile robots operating in a common environment. It is designed to meet the stringent requirements of loosely coupled multi-robot architectures, such as flexibility, reliability, and fault-tolerance. As such, the proposed architecture enables the robots to deal with various types of uncertainties in their operating environments. The proposed architecture takes advantage of scalable sensory-based P2P framework. It also offers an inter-robot communication protocol, which is specifically designed to satisfy the requirements of physical sensory data publishing and fusion. The architecture is implemented and evaluated on a team of indoor mobile robots. The test results manifest the architecture's distinguished features and capabilities. © 2007 IEEE.

AB  - The open source software movement has been going on for a few decades now. Today, an increasing number of open source solutions enter the market and become valid alternatives to proprietary and closed solutions. Examples include operating systems like Linux and OpenSolaris, back-end solutions (e.g. LAMP - Linux, Apache web server, MySQL database, and Perl/PHP/Python programming languages - are among the most well-known and widely used open source software on the Internet), office applications (e.g. Firefox web browser, Thunderbird email, GIMP graphics, OpenOffice office suite), and complete enterprise systems like Compiere (ERP and CRM) and Mambo content management system (CMS). In addition, a variety of devices increasingly include open source (e.g. cellular phones, network equipment like routers, and Asterisk - a complete IP PBX). The open source culture is about much more than software and includes open source hardware, views on intellectual properties rights, completely changes how products are developed and owned, and how business models are developed. To decide if open source is something for you, a good understanding of what open source really means is necessary. This includes legal aspects (different licenses), availability of support with (hopefully a thriving) user community and commercial for-pay support options, and security. Intellectual properties rights, and the vast number of many types of open source licenses (e.g. GNU General Public License (GPL) and BSD License), is one of the more complex areas when using open source. What can and not can be done, what must be done, and so on, vary between licenses. One effort to bring some order in all this is the Open Source Definition (OSD) from Open Source Initiative (OSI) which lists ten conditions that must be met for an OSI Certified open source license. Today, many companies have already been forced to either remove or release as open source code borrowed by developers without properly complying with licenses. Such "dirty code" is increasingly easy to detect via compliance tools used by companies doing this as business. (Not to mention whistle-blowing employees tipping of property owners.) Searching for dirty code is also increasingly part of due diligence in mergers and acquisitions and can add costly delays and lawsuits. The perceived low cost is often a reason for considering open source solutions but the total costs of development (TCD) - including for example licenses, tools, labor, and support - must be considered from initial design, to maintenance, all through the end of life of the product. This paper reviews critical aspects for going open source, including software and hardware, use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) alternatives, system design going from a monlithic, single-binary, firmware to a layered design with operating system, middleware, and user applications. © 2007 IEEE.

AB  - The deployment of networks has become ubiquitous in the avionics world, as they have opened the door to a rich suite of common and open hardware and software tools that provide greater functionality and interoperability. Unfortunately, a number of networked avionic and other related applications can be affected by vendor or application specific proprietary implementations. These "closed" implementations may reduce or eliminate the benefits of a standardized network, requiring the customization of the data acquisition system to allow it to properly operate with the other devices. This paper presents the approach that was recently employed for the development of a network interface module that can be quickly reconfigured to address the changing requirements of network applications, including monitoring of industry standard and proprietary networks, or providing the command and data interface to the data acquisition system itself. This reconfigurability of the module is shown in a review of four different specific applications. © International Foundation for Telemetering, 2007.

AB  - IP-PBXs work with VoIP telephones to connect a number of private extensions through lines to the public phone system, routing outbound, and incoming calls and providing features such as voice services on an IP based data network and teleconferencing. IP-PBXs can also mix IP and traditional telephony, as in trunking a call from an analog phone over the Internet and routing an incoming analog call from the PSTN to a VoIP telephone. An extremely low cost yet powerful IP-PBX reference design can be developed and put into production by the combination of the Analog Devices Blackfin, which is an open hardware, to Asterisk, Oslec, and uClinux. The IP04 is such an open hardware IP-PBX design that uses a four port IP-PBX running Asterisk and uClinux on a Blackfin processor. The Blackfin boot ROM starts reading from the 256-kbit SPI flash chip, when power is applied. IP04 requires a lot of flash storage to store the Asterisk executable and audio prompts in comparison to embedded Linux systems.

AB  - A common multidisciplinary platform can improve and fine-tune the collaboration between several courses like data communication, software engineering, analog electronics and digital design. Therefore, De Nayer Instituut developed a platform that consists of two low-cost boards. An interface experimentation board featuring an analog experimentation area and various in- and outputs. The second board is build around a microcontroller that can be used to control the experimentation board. Both boards can be used without the need for expensive hardware allowing the students to prepare or finish their assignments at home. © 2007 IEEE.

AB  - Reusability is the key element in today's VLSI design. Open-source hardware provides a more thorough and effective way for design reusability than traditional charged closed-source IP by sharing its design documents and IP modules. And open-source hardware based SoC design method is being accepted and practiced by more and more designers. This paper introduces relative concepts, benefits, problems and perspectives of open-source hardware in detail, and discusses open-source hardware based design flow in depth by exampling an open-source processor design.

AB  - While robotics becomes pervasive and people get used to the idea of robots interacting with human beings in daily life, the culture of this technology and science has to be introduced in early studies. Robotics teaching is in fact a reality in Universities but a lot of interest truly exist even in High and Secondary School. However, since the cost of a robotic laboratory is relevant, the development of inexpensive devices for teaching in Secondary Schools is necessary. In this paper we present Eddy (Educational Device: Do it Yourself!) our own educational mobile robot. Our aim is to provide a inexpensive mobile platform with highly customizable sensor capability. Also, by following the Open Hardware Paradigm, we provide all schematics and source code in order to let students build, enhance and use their own robot.

AB  - An open hardware architecture for a goal-oriented indoor mobile robot navigation based on corrected odometry information using fuzzy logic controller is presented in this paper. The proposed approach exploits the ability of mobile robots to navigate in unstructured, cluttered and potentially hostile environments using calibrated odometry information, proximity sensor data and a fuzzy logic engine. A key advantage to this technique is its simplicity over similar navigation systems discussed in the literature. The simplification stems from the fact that only the previous traveled position of the robot needs to be tracked to reach to the target position. The superiority of this technique is supported by the experimental results that were collected for this purpose. ©2007 IEEE.

AB  - Application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in hygienic design has many possibilities at different levels of detail and complexity, from the prediction of adhesion and cleaning based on a hydrodynamic parameter point of view, over the more detailed approach where hydrodynamic parameters from CFD simulations are used as input to mathematical models of adhesion and cleaning, to the use of CFD for predicting pasteurization and sterilization of equipment based on heat transfer due to convection and in some cases also conduction of heat through solid surfaces. The sparse work done so far focuses on applying CFD for prediction of cleaning in closed processing equipment as this provides relatively well-defined boundary conditions. Extending it to open equipment increases the complexity of the modeling, as twophase flow and free surface flows in these cases have to be modeled and this is still a fairly new subject to treat for commercial CFD programs. © 2007 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - A fast and simple method for the chemical degradation of PET, poly(ethylene terephthalate) under microwave irradiation is reported, in the presence of basic catalysts. The all reactions were carried out in grycol under a open equipment using microwave oven. For the microwave promoted reactions, not only the reaction times were always notably shortened, but also the yields of terephthalic acid derivatives were quantitatively. Interestingly, the degradation of PET easily also proceeded by using sodium bicarbonate and glycerin to give terephthalic acid in high yeld.

AB  - The United States Air Force (USAF) has an inventory of over 24,000 aircraft with over 47,000 gas turbine engines. Aircraft systems are expensive and must be periodically modernized or upgraded to keep pace with changing threats, missions, and advancing technology. Controls and accessories comprise approximately 1/5 of the total cost of an engine. The main component of the controls system is the Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC). Legacy FADEC systems are both unique and dedicated to a specific weapon system. Today, each FADEC design is unique within its application class. Developing a universal or common standard for engine controls and accessories which includes FADECs would significantly reduce development and support costs across DoD platforms. With engines representing up to 60% of the platform operating costs, modernizing them could provide significant return on investment and avoid the high cost of full system replacement. Obsolescence issues consume considerable funds and manpower and increase the risk to operational missions and the supply pipeline. To minimize the impact obsolesce, technology insertion can provide alternatives that leverage state-of-the art hardware and software to resolve the unavailability of critical parts, enhance performance and decrease cost. These alternatives will be developed through open system architectures with common or "universal" standardized inputs and outputs with improved reliability (reduce failures), common and advanced materials, reusable software, decreased number of components, high-reliability modules and improved manufacturing processes. The universal FADEC system for DoD engines will involve a family of common components. It will consist of a real-time operating system and partitioned application software (AS) structure. These components will significantly ease the strain on the supply and maintenance infrastructure. The universal FADEC vision is to develop a common input/output scheme, open hardware and software architecture, and generic circuit modules. A systems approach will be employed, considering sensors, cabling, connectors, and interface standards, as well as the FADEC electronic hardware and software.

AB  - Background: Measurement of locomotor activity is a valuable tool for analysing factors influencing behaviour and for investigating brain function. Several methods have been described in the literature for measuring the amount of animal movement but most are flawed or expensive. Here, we describe an open source, modular, low-cost, user-friendiy, highly sensitive, non-invasive system that records all the movements of a rat in its cage. Methods: Our activity monitoring system quantifies overall free movements of rodents without any markers, using a commercially available CCTV and a newly designed motion detection software developed on a GNU/Linux-operating computer. The operating principle is that the amount of overall movement of an object can be expressed by the difference in total area occupied by the object in two consecutive picture frames. The application is based on software modules that allow the system to be used in a high-throughput workflow. Documentation, example files, source code and binary files can be freely downloaded from the project website at http://bioinformatics.org/gemvid/. Results: In a series of experiments with objects of pre-defined oscillation frequencies and movements, we documented the sensitivity, reproducibility and stability of our system. We also compared data obtained with our system and data obtained with an Actiwatch device. Finally, to validate the system, results obtained from the automated observation of 6 rats during 7 days in a regular light cycle are presented and are accompanied by a stability test. The validity of this system is further demonstrated through the observation of 2 rats in constant dark conditions that displayed the expected free running of their circadian rhythm. Conclusion: The present study describes a system that relies on video frame differences to automatically quantify overall free movements of a rodent without any markers. It allows the monitoring of rats in their own environment for an extended period of time. By using a low-cost, open source hardware/software solution, laboratories can greatly simplify their data acquisition and analysis pipelines and improve their workload. © 2006 Poirrier et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Eye tracking has long held the promise of being a useful methodology for human computer interaction. However, a number of barriers have stood in the way of the integration of eye tracking into everyday applications, including the intrusiveness, robustness, availability and price of eye-tracking systems. To lower these barriers, we have developed the openEyes system. The system consists of an open-hardware design for a digital eye tracker that can be built from low-cost off-the-shelf components, and a set of open-source software tools for digital image capture, manipulation, and analysis in eye-tracking applications. We expect that the availability of this system will facilitate the development of eye-tracking applications and the eventual integration of eye tracking into the next generation of everyday human computer interfaces. We discuss the methods and technical challenges of low-cost eye tracking as well as the design decisions that produced our current system.

AB  - Industrialised nations have dedicated significant investments toward the development of civil infrastructure. To preserve this investment, attention must be given to proper maintenance. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has emerged as a tool to support this task. Networks of smart sensors, built upon wireless communication, have the potential to significantly improve SHM. Numerous platforms for smart sensors have been developed, most of which utilise proprietary hardware/software. The Berkeley Mote, utilised in this study, was the first open hardware/software platform to be developed. However, the Berkeley Mote was designed for generic applications and therefore the available sensors are not optimised for use in civil infrastructure applications. Acceleration and strain are among the most important physical quantities to judge the health of a structure. Although commercially available sensor boards have accelerometers, their applicability towards civil infrastructure is limited. This paper presents the development of new acceleration and strain sensor boards based on the Berkely-Mote platform and provides experimental verification of their performance within civil infrastructure applications. © Imperial College Press.

AB  - With the new and powerful Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) families, new possibilities have been opened. One of these features is the possibility of reconfiguring a section of the FPGA while the rest is working. Moreover, this fixed part could be responsible for reprogramming the reconfigurable part, either because a change in functionality is required or because a new version of the hardware needs to be implemented. This paper shows how an FPGA system based on an Open Source OpenRISC 1200 microprocessor takes advantage of this feature to perform the Secure Download of the firmware and the hardware needed to run an application. In this particular case a Reed-Solomon Encoder and a Cryptographic application were used to demonstrate the viability of the scheme. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) is a standard computer application that molecular biologists use to search for sequence similarity in genomic databases. This report describes the implementation of an FPGA-based hardware implementation designed to accelerate the BLAST algorithm. FPGA-based custom computing machines, more widely known as Reconfigurable Computing, are supported by a number of vendors and the basic cost of FPGA hardware is dramatically decreasing. Hence, the main objective of this project is to explore the feasibility of using this new technology to realize a portable, Open Source FPGA-based accelerator for the BLAST Algorithm. The present design is targeted to an Acellcard and the design is based on the latest version of BLAST available from NCBI. Since the entire application does not fit in hardware, a profile study was conducted that identifies the computationally intensive part of BLAST. An FPGA hardware component has been designed and implemented for this critical segment. The portability and cost-effectiveness of the design are discussed.

Specifically, just as open source has spawned a revolution in the technical, business, and legal model for software, open hardware will provide a swell of collaborative innovation that will create entirely new markets and provide significant business benefits to the most creative, most reliable, and most adaptable semiconductor, EDA, System-On-Chip (SoC) and systems houses. The open-source software stack with Linux as its cornerstone is increasingly the preferred choice for newly venture-funded companies. Open hardware will also change the world of SoC venture investing. While the degree of openness and the business model may vary, SoC products have to be increasingly developed through a collaborative model that helps assemble IP blocks and services from multiple sources. In this paper we describe the open standards model for hardware, chip, and tool innovation, and we argue the a systematic IP valuation methodology will help the success of this environment, in that it will allow each member of the value chain especially small VC-backed companies - to capture enough value to desire to participate. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - Open source software running on inexpensive, commercially available GPS receivers promises to cut the expense and restrictions of developing extended GPS applications dramatically. Extended GPS applications, such as keeping GPS satellite signal lock in high-dynamic environments or deep coupling of inertial data, require direct access to the receiver's hardware. This access is usually only provided by very expensive and restrictive development kits, many of which still do not grant the developer direct access to the receiver chip set. Our software allows GPS developers to convert an inexpensive, commercially available GPS receiver into an open source development system that provides complete access to the receiver's hardware. The software, licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), is called GPL-GPS. This paper describes the motivations, principles and technical development of the GPL-GPS project. This includes choosing a GPS receiver chipset, choosing a receiver board, and porting the software necessary to make a fully functional open source GPS receiver and receiver development system. The paper concludes with results from a static positioning test, results from a GPS simulator running a simulated sounding rocket trajectory, and future work. GPL-GPS currently supports the Zarlink GP4020, a 12-channel L1 C/A GPS receiver baseband processor with an integrated 32 bit ARM7TDMI microprocessor, because of its open and extensive documentation. Commercially available receivers, coupled with an open hardware carrier board, can create a full featured development kit for less than US$300. GPL-GPS is intended to be part of an inexpensive 6 degree-of-freedom differential GPS-aided inertial navigation system designed for a small, inexpensive, and open source sounding rocket platform being developed by the Portland State Aerospace Society.

AB  - To make the complex mechanical equipment work in good service, the technology for realizing an embedded open system is introduced systematically, including open hardware configuration, customized embedded operation system and open software structure. The ETX technology is adopted in this system, integrating the CPU main-board functions, and achieving the quick, real-time signal acquisition and intelligent data analysis with applying DSP and CPLD data acquisition card. Under the open configuration, the signal bus mode such as PCI, ISA and PC/104 can be selected and the styles of the signals can be chosen too. In addition, through customizing XPE system, adopting the EWF (Enhanced Write Filter), and realizing the open system authentically, the stability of the system is enhanced. Multi-thread and multi-task programming techniques are adopted in the software programming process. Interconnecting with the remote fault diagnosis center via the net interface, cooperative diagnosis is conducted and the intelligent degree of the fault diagnosis is improved.

AB  - Eye tracking has long held the promise of being a useful methodology for human computer interaction. However, a number of barriers have stood in the way of the integration of eye tracking into everyday applications, including the intrusiveness, robustness, availability, and price of eye-tracking systems. To lower these barriers, we have developed the openEyes system. The system consists of an open-hardware design for a digital eye tracker that can be built from low-cost off-the-shelf components, and a set of open-source software tools for digital image capture, manipulation, and analysis in eye-tracking applications. We expect that the availability of this system will facilitate the development of eye-tracking applications and the eventual integration of eye tracking into the next generation of everyday human computer interfaces, We discuss the methods and technical challenges of low-cost eye tracking as well as the design decisions that produced our current system. © 2006 ACM.

AB  - In the biomedical applications it is often necessary to collect measurement data from different devices. It is relatively easy, if the devices are equipped with a MIB or Ethernet interface, however often they feature only the asynchronous serial link, and sometimes the measured values are available only as the analog signals. The system presented in the paper is a low cost alternative to commercially available data acquisition systems. The hardware and software architecture of the system is fully open, so it is possible to customize it for particular needs. The presented system offers various possibilities to connect it to the computer based data processing unit - e.g. using the USB or Ethernet ports. Both interfaces allow also to use many such systems in parallel to increase amount of serial and analog inputs. The open source software used in the system makes possible to process the acquired data with standard tools like MATLAB,1 Scilab2 or Octave 3,4 or with a dedicated, user supplied application.

AB  - An open condition-monitoring system combined C/S (Client / Server) with B/ S (Brower / Server) pattern was introduced. It consists of three parts of software: SE (Server-Terminal), ADE (Analysis-Diagnosis-Terminal) and DAE (Data-Acquisition-Terminal). SE can monitor every connection request from ADE or DAE user and determinate whether ADE or DAE can be run on client's PC. As a result, the system security is improved in a sense. Additionally, the system hardware part comprises two kinds of terminal portable instruments: DASOC(data-acquisition system on chip based-on the Cygnal MCU) and DSAI(dynamic signal analysis instrument based on an embedded OS:XPE). DASOC and DSAI can realize data-acquisition, signal analysis and data-transmission based-on internet. The system structure mode has been applied to a certain power plant's enterprise information network in Tianjin. Results show that the system is successful.

AB  - A distributed control system based on heterogeneous agent for mobile robot was described. The system architecture combines three layers including deliberative layer, reactive control layer and coordination layer, and adopts multiple heterogeneous agents to implement corresponding function distributed in different control systems. The information of the instantaneous environmental snap from a laser scanner is used to control the mobile robot dynamically in unknown environment in local planning, while reversed D* algorithm is adopted to search the leave point for avoiding local minimum trap in deliberative planning. Deliberative layer and control layer are implemented by heterogeneous and distributed control system with two low power-consuming industrial control computers. This system architecture realizes the real time of reactive control and the adaptability of deliberative planning in complex environment. Open hardware platform with software Agent architecture has a good scalability and provides a paradigm for mobile robot design.

AB  - The expansion of 'open' hardware, which will provide a boost in collaborative innovations, is discussed. The word 'open' is not limited to open source, where specifications or source code are freely available and can be modified by a community of users. It could also mean that the hardware details can be viewed, but not modified. The Power.org mission statement calls for an open-standard hardware development platform for the electronics industry, with open standards, specifications, and guidelines. An active community is also developing around open-source intellectual property (IP) cores. An OpenTech CD-ROM compiles several hundred open-source EDA software programs and hardware designs.

AB  - A current focus of many instrumentation and Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) designers is the area of Synthetic Instrumentation. This instrumentation, which consists of physically separate building blocks or modules, provides the opportunity to reduce the system's overall hardware content by eliminating common hardware functionality located within each traditional instrument. This modular design provides opportunities for lower lifecycle cost, smaller physical packages and increased capabilities through module upgrades. However, the design of synthetic instrumentation and its integration into an ATE system poses technical challenges not typically seen with traditional instrumentation. Traditional instrument developers are now faced with the challenge of determining how their existing and future modules, for example a digitizer or waveform generator, satisfy a portion of the requirements of a synthetic instrument. ATE developers are challenged to identify the proper set of modules, primarily Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS), that together satisfy the system level requirements. In addition, they must address instrumentation concurrency, synchronization, switching, and develop a software and hardware architecture that supports future upgrades as technology advances. Each of these issues requires a strong system engineering discipline that can develop a robust system architecture. In 2002 SEI began a program to integrate synthetic instrumentation that provided the functionality of a spectrum analyzer, A/D converter, counter timer, UART and AVMUX into a legacy Air Force Test Station. In 2003 SEI continued with an additional program that consisted of design and development of a synthetic instrument that provided the functionality of a power meter, spectrum analyzer, frequency time interval counter, oscilloscope and digital multi meter. During each of these programs SEI worked directly with commercial instrument manufacturers, electrical designers and the military to establish the system requirements and resulting architecture. This paper will describe the key technical issues encountered while defining the system architecture including concurrency, modularity, synchronization, and maintaining an open hardware and software architecture. In addition, the resultant system architecture will be described. ©2004 IEEE.

AB  - To date, the market for open-source software has significantly grown. Currently, the issue is whether open-source hardware (OSH)will be as successful as open-source software. A look at the market shows that some open-source reduced-instruction-set computing (RISC) microprocessor projects are already available. However, other issues still looms indicating that a design constructed entirely of OSH blocks is not likely to be a commercial success.

AB  - Advances in IC fabrication technology have made the design of complex and powerful embedded appliances feasible. To design such appliances, a hardware/software co-design methodology, which allows concurrent hardware and software development before a system prototype is available, is the preferred solution. While different hardware and software specification techniques present obstacles that each combined approach has to overcome, the introduction of SystemC, a C++ class library for hardware and system level specification, has opened a new horizon. This paper combines open source components, to built a custom and flexible co-simulation environment based on SystemC. Even though commercial solutions for this problem have recently been introduced, their high cost and small to medium scale customization capability, make this open source and fully customizable competitor look appealing, especially for researchers and small companies.

AB  - Events of recent world history notwithstanding, there is an undeniable increase in awareness and activity concerning the security of manufacturing and utility plant control systems. As process control systems have migrated from proprietary to open hardware and software platforms and as digital control systems have become ubiquitous in the control of manufacturng processes, they have become more subject to the same vulnerabilities and scrutiny as more conventional business information technology (IT). And, as recognition of the need for secure manufacturing control systems has grown considerably in recent years, a number of organizations have become involved in tthe development of policy, direction, standards, and practices for the secure design, implementation, and operation of manufacturing control systems. This session will present an overview of the organizations and initiatives involved in this and a review and update on the activities of the Instrumentation, Systems and Automation Society's (ISA) SP99 standards committee on Manufacturing and Control Systems Security.

AB  - An increasing interest towards the utilization of open hardware and software platforms for industrial control applications has arisen during the last decade. Some of the most important developed projects are OSACA in Europe, OSEC in Japan and OMAC in the US. All these efforts are directed to the definition of an open architecture for controllers of manufacturing systems. The PC (personal computer) as the control platform facilitates the conectivity, standardization and availability of components, and the cost reduction. An aspect, however, remains scarcely analized: the application of these concepts on equipments designed with a propietary control structure. An open control system for an SCARA industrial robot YAMAHA YK7000 has been developed to analize its viability and evaluate difficulties and limitations. The controller follows the guidelines defined by the OMAC architecture (Open Modular Architecture for Controllers). The control functions were implemented on a dual platform (two PCs): The first PC supports the critical functions, executing the paths planning and axes control tasks with a commercial axes control card. The second one supports the functions of user interfacing with the user and other non-critical time applications. Both computers are connected by a TCP/IP link.

AB  - In recent years, Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has emerged as an important research area in civil engineering. To investigate both local and global damage criteria, a dense array of sensors is anticipated to be required for large civil engineering structures. Traditional centralized data acquisition systems do not provide a scalable approach, since the shear number of accompanying wires, fiber optic cables, or other physical transmission medium may be prohibitive. Wireless communications have the potential to significantly impact monitoring systems. To assist in dealing with the large amount of data that will be generated, on-board processing at the sensor allows a portion of the computation to be done locally on the sensor's embedded microprocessor. The Mica Mote platform, along with Tiny Operating System (TinyOS) developed at the University of California at Berkeley offers for the first time, an open hardware/software environment for broad smart sensing research. However, because the accelerometers on the existing sensor boards have both poor low frequency sensitivity and high noise density, their suitability for civil engineering applications is unclear. This paper presents results for a new sensor board employing an SD-1221 accelerometer, which overcomes many of the deficiencies of the existing sensor. Finally, a number of the challenges still remaining are identified. Copyright © 2003 by DEStech Publications, Inc. All right reserved.

AB  - A fully integrated optical and electrical measurement system made of off-the-shelf optical components and electrical instruments that characterizes the micro motions for MEMS dynamic performance at the wafer/die level automatically is presented. Both periodic and non-periodic in-plane micro motions could be measured by the blur-synthesis method based on the machine vision technology. The periodic out-of-plane micro motions could be estimated by the laser stroboscopic phase-shifting interferometry with the digital image processing technology. Some improved algorithms together with the sub pixel method and 2D waveform transform technology are bought forward and experimented for the measurement of micro motions with higher resolution. The methods could measure micro motions up to tens of KHz in real time with nano resolution and the characterization is both in situ and nondestructive. Based upon the virtual instrument technology, the measurement system with friendly user interfaces, open hardware and software architectures and expansible features could be used practically in MEMS R&D field and more improvements to this system could be made continually.

AB  - In this paper, we describe additions and modifications to the Computational Plant (Cplant™) system software to support multi-processor compute nodes and to support heterogeneous node types. We describe how these capabilities have been incorporated into our scalable runtime system and how these changes affect the interface seen by end users and application developers. We also discuss several important operating system and networking issues that can directly impact application performance. We present some initial performance metrics that indicate how our current implementation scales when multiple processes are running on a single node. © 2002 IEEE.

We have constructed a test-bed using Pentium PCs and Linux and used this test-bed to try a well-known MPLS traffic engineering feature of separating flows into multiple trunks. The purpose of this separation is to experimentally assess the quality of service benefits we can expect from MPLS networks. We experiment with a hierarchical separation structure where the first level of separation is based on the transport layer used (TCP or UDP). This high level separation prevents UDP from unfairly grabbing the available bandwidth from TCP applications. Since different applications using TCP have different needs, e.g., some might want high bandwidth while others are more sensitive to packet delay, the second level of separation is based on application type. The results from our open experimental test-bed confirms the intuitive results by demonstrating better QoS with the flow separation in the MPLS core.

AB  - The Cuban Weather Radar Network is composed by 3 RC-32B (Japan) and 4 MRL-5 (Russia). In 1993 the Cuban Meteorological Service decided to mount a modernized radar prototype at Camaguey Meteorological Center, incorporating computer control and data acquisition hardware to achieve fully unmanned operation. Modernization of conventional weather radars is now possible within a small budget using open hardware and software architectures. Our Primary Processor 'ELBRUS' (Signal Processor + Radar Controller) makes use of available computer cards and commercial PC systems. The system architecture was designed with a particular stress on software. All functions that could be handled within the Data Acquisition Computer have been put there. Also, a versatile Product Generator and Processing System were developed. Vesta processor Vesta RPG and its front end application VestaζProcess deal with product and composite generation, data base management and web server links. They function in a server-client fashion using standard protocols. Results obtained with this prototype are now being extended to other 6 radars under a National Program for the modernization of the Cuban Weather Radar Network, which also includes composition and distribution of the products.

AB  - This paper present an approach for building a multiprocessor robot controller. It is well known, that new concepts of the automatic control have to be tested not only with the use of simulation techniques, but also with experiments on the real mechanisms. Transfer from simulations to experiments is enabled by the use of the open structure of robot controller. For user, it is also possible to include algorithm in the existing structure, like the assembling of blocks in the simulation programs. Results can be followed by the real-time display of the desired system variables, which can also be saved for the later processing. Since real-time operation is required, local decisions about the packet contents have to be made. Also communication connections - paths are destined in such a manner that the fastest possible transfer is enabled. Because of the complexity of the tasks multiprocessor control system with the optimal distribution of tasks is used. In recent years the number of applications using laser beam for cutting various materials, such as metals (in most cases iron), fabric and paper, is increasing. In our Institute a belt driven machine of that kind was built. PC and transputer based controller width open hardware and software architecture was implemented. Complete laser cutting system represents successful industrial application of emerging technologies.

AB  - With the widespread applications of GPS and the ever changing and evolving GPS requirements and capabilities, both in the commercial and military markets, there is a need for a flexible open architecture GPS receiver that would support laboratory development testing of GPS receiver design concepts, integration schemes, and GPS applications. The experience of the Central Engineering Activity (CEA) GPS Laboratory at NRaD San Diego supports the need for such a receiver. The special investigations and R&D GPS projects conducted by NRaD frequently require novel integration or data collection capabilities. These would only be readily available in a flexible receiver with a high degree of adaptability to the laboratory's ever-changing needs. The GPS Integration Receiver-Programmable (GPS-PRO) receiver, which utilizes an open hardware and software architecture, provides the necessary flexibility to perform this function. The GPS-PRO uses Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) hardware, an open architecture for external sensors, external communications and control, digital control, open software architecture, functional breakout points, and an upgradable daughter board concept for application specific systems. Such a receiver configuration provides the flexibility to interchange or insert new hardware or software modules in order to evaluate their performance in a controlled environment or provide an integrated system solution. The GPS-PRO flexible (programmable) functionality allows for its use as a design tool for R&D and hardware in-the-loop testing, application specific tailoring for low cost, small size customer demands, while providing benchmark performance capabilities.

AB  - A robotic testbed has been developed in our laboratory by retrofitting a PUMA 560 industrial robot with a custom-built controller. The main objective of the testbed is to provide researchers with a robot control system possessing an open hardware structure, high computational capacity, and good software programmability, such that various advanced control schemes intended for robots can be implemented in real-time and evaluated through physical experiments rather than simulation. On this testbed, different control schemes including regressor based adaptive control of the robot performing tracking tasks are implemented. Dynamics of robot actuators are incorporated in the experiments. The performance of these control schemes is quantitatively evaluated. For comparison purposes, a conventional PD controller is also implemented independently in each joint of the robot. This paper outlines the hardware configuration and software support of the testbed. Adaptive control scheme incorporating actuator dynamics is described and experimental results are presented. These experiments show that advanced control schemes can be effectively used to improve the performance of an industrial robot in a significant manner.

AB  - A neurorehabilitation workstation (NRW) which integrates multiple data acquisition devices, interface technologies, advanced analytical techniques, and multisensory rendering capabilities is described. Emphasis is placed on machine-resident intelligence embedded at several levels. The goals of the NRW are twofold; 1) to provide an open hardware platform and modular infrastructure which will expedite the implementation of new technologies into the clinic; and 2) to augment clinical therapy with new methods of interaction and analysis. Success should result in providing neurorehabilitation, and the medical community in general, with a powerful tool for characterizing the complex nature of normal and impaired human performance.

AB  - CAM systems for PCB tooling have evolved through several phases in the 80's. The market was entered first with software adapted from other industries, such as mapmaking or publishing. In the next phase, software was developed specifically for the PCB tooling task. These systems were all 'closed' and usually ran on proprietary hardware. The next step, in the late 80's, was the move to standard hardware platforms. Soon, almost all CAM systems were available either on DOS based PC's or Unix based workstation platforms. The vendors of these systems presented them as the complete solution to the PCB CAM process. However, users soon learned that no CAM system could completely meet all of their needs. At the start of the 90's we see systems that are 'closed' to outside access running on 'open' hardware platforms with many third party software products trying to fill in the gaps in these systems.

AB  - Current programmable logic controllers (PLCs) have a broader range of flexibility than ever before. Advances in technologies with increased memory, open hardware architectures and common communication protocols allow for more complex control applications. In particular, expanded RLL (Relay Ladder Logic) programming languages incorporate high level commands for data manipulation and math algorithms such as table creation, alternate numeric conversions and PID functionality to name just a few. The ladder language has evolved to allow for structured programming which permits greater capabilities especially in control loop repeated function reusability. Computers interfaced through 'real time' local area networks (LAN's) can archive data, store recipes, log events, log alarms, provide process analysis functions, and a variety of other applications. This paper will concentrate on a GE Fanuc Automation system utilizing these new emerging abilities for process control systems incorporating up to 64 loops (or more) of control. PLCs offer flexibility in design, installation, and maintenance for the system without the need for dependent vendor service and support for configuration, implementation, and modification. The control system was applied in the chemical production of base polymers for various types of plastics.

AB  - AS we enter the second decade of automated geographic information systems, important technology trends are emerging that will have a strong impact on how these systems are used and by whom. No longer are departmental systems hidden in the back room, accessible only to the technocrats. Today, cooperating organizations require an approach through which the system is accessible to a diverse blend of nontechnical users with differing applications. These multiparticipant groups also demand technology capable of managing the distribution of data to these numerous end users. To accommodate these requirements, six important trends have evolved: Continuous geographic coverage, spatial-relational data-base management, topological structures, distributed processing, content management, and open hardware and software architectures. This paper describes these trends and their impact on multiparticipant, multiapplication geographic information systems. © ASCE.
