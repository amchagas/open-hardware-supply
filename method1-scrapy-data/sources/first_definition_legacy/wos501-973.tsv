The proposed technology consists in an embedded system developed with an open-source hardware platform and connected through a wireless sensor and actuator mesh network. By learning commands from the air conditioner's remote control, the system is capable of implementing automatic control of the air conditioner equipment. Through a central command unit, it is possible to configure timers to turn on and off all devices connected to the network. The system also adds intelligence to conventional equipment by making use of a motion sensor, avoiding electricity waste. An automatic temperature control is implemented through sensors that monitor external conditions. By making use of a mesh network based on DigiMesh protocol, each device acts like a router, increasing network range and making it easier to add or remove new devices. The proposed system was validated through case study.

The PalmNET monitoring system is composed by a WSN used for in-field soil's condition measurement and a web-server interface for data visualization. PalmNET can automatically collect soil moisture data and transmit field data through a ZigBee network to a web-server. The PalmNET proof-of-concept is a WSN built upon open-source hardware and software, which includes two sensor nodes, a sink and a Gateway with a GPRS module. The WSN was deployed in Palmar de la Vizcaina Experimental Field Station having the following proof of concept objectives: (i) collect and centralize soil moisture data and (ii) post data to a web application interface. Results have revealed PalmNET as a feasible, automated and solar powered application for oil palm plantations in Colombia.	[Culman, Maria; Portocarrero, Jesus M.

Consequently, the risk of blades breakage by hitting the tower has increased. In order to prevent such incidents, this study proposes a deflection monitoring system that can be installed to already operating wind turbine's blades. The monitoring system is composed of an estimation algorithm to detect blade deflection and a wireless sensor network as a hardware equipment. As for the estimation method for blade deflection, a strain-based estimation algorithm and an objective function for optimal sensor arrangement are proposed. Strain-based estimation algorithm is using a linear correlation between strain and deflections, which can be expressed in a form of a transformation matrix. The objective function includes the terms of strain sensitivity and condition number of the transformation matrix between strain and deflection. In order to calculate the objective function, a simplified experimental model of the blade is constructed by interpolating the mode shape of a blade from modal testing. The interpolation method is effective considering a practical use to operating wind turbines' blades since it is not necessary to establish a finite element model of a blade. On the other hand, a sensor network with wireless connection with an open source hardware is developed. It is installed to a 300 W scale wind turbine and vibration of the blade on operation is investigated. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved..

The instrument implements the higher order Campbelling methods and self-monitoring capabilities on an open source development board. The board includes an CPU/FPGA System on a Chip. The feasibility of the measurement instrument was tested both in laboratory with a signal generator and in the Minerve reactor. It is shown that the instrument provides reliable and robust count rate estimation over a wide reactor power range based on the third order statistics of the fission chamber signal. In addition, the system is able to identify whether the measured count rate change is due to the malfunction of the detector or due to the change in the neutron flux. The applied self-monitoring method is based on the spectral properties of the fission chamber signal. During the experimental verification, the considered malfunction was the change of the polarization voltage. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In smart buildings it is necessary to allow for the integration of human behaviour in the HVAC system. In addition, many researchers are limited in their investigation by not having low cost tools that can provide information for their studies. This article is a review of the present state of art about the globe thermometer. It describes how to build your own globe temperature sensor and describes experiments that illustrate the feasibility of using a black globe thermometer with 40 mm diameter.

The efficient use of irrigation water is a key factor in coping with the food demands of an increasing world population and with the negative effects of climate change on water resource availability in many areas. In this complex context, it is important that farmers can rely on instruments and practices that enable a better management of water at the field scale, whatever the irrigation method they adopt. In this paper, we present an open-hardware device based on the Arduino technology that was developed to allow the continuous monitoring of soil water potential in the root zone for supporting irrigation scheduling at the field scale. The structure of the device is flexible and can be adapted to host different types of sensors. The results, obtained managing irrigation in a peach orchard, show that adoption of the device, together with a simple irrigation scheduling criterion, allowed a significant increase of water use efficiency without causing a reduction of the quantity and quality of crop production.

The superior-inferior movement required to simulate tumour motion during a normal breathing cycle was achieved via the novel use of an Arduino Uno (TM), a low-cost open-source microcontroller board connected to a high torque servo motor. Slow CT imaging was used to acquire the image set and a 4D cone beam CT (4D-CBCT) verified the efficacy of contoured margins before treatment on the moving phantom. Treatment fields were delivered to a section of a CIRS (TM) anthropomorphic phantom. Dose verification to the dynamic phantom with Gafchromic EBT3 film using 3 %-1 mm gamma analysis acceptance criteria registered an absolute dose pass rate for IMRT and VMAT of 98 and 96.6 %, respectively. It was verified that 100 % of the PTV received the prescribed dose of 12 Gy per fraction using the dynamic phantom, and no major discrepancy between planned and measured results due to interplay between multileaf collimator sequences and target motion was observed. This study confirmed that the use of an in-house solution using open source hardware and software with existing quality assurance equipment was appropriate in validating a new treatment technique.

This system is capable of deposition using three different techniques sequentially on the same substrate. The techniques available are ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR), electrodeposition, and dip coating on both rigid and flexible conductive substrates (FTO, ITO-PEN). Using low-cost electronic components, we built a working prototype, driven by a simple software that is open source and user-friendly. In order to test our system, we used it to fabricate dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and counter electrodes of platinum and cobalt sulfide using both rigid glass-FTO and flexible ITO-PEN substrates. The electrodes as well as the complete devices have been characterized through cyclic voltammetry (CV). The solar cell devices have been characterized through current versus voltage curves (I-V) under simulated solar illumination.	[Congiu, M.; Graeff, C. F.

An open-hardware platform for optogenetics and photobiology	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							CIRCADIAN PHOTOTAXIS RHYTHM; GENE-EXPRESSION SYSTEM; MAMMALIAN-CELLS; SPATIOTEMPORAL CONTROL; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; OPTICAL CONTROL; PROTEIN INTERACTIONS; MEDIATED INDUCTION; ACTION SPECTRUM; LIVING CELLS	In optogenetics, researchers use light and genetically encoded photoreceptors to control biological processes with unmatched precision. However, outside of neuroscience, the impact of optogenetics has been limited by a lack of user-friendly, flexible, accessible hardware. Here, we engineer the Light Plate Apparatus (LPA), a device that can deliver two independent 310 to 1550 nm light signals to each well of a 24-well plate with intensity control over three orders of magnitude and millisecond resolution. Signals are programmed using an intuitive web tool named Iris. All components can be purchased for under $400 and the device can be assembled and calibrated by a non-expert in one day. We use the LPA to precisely control gene expression from blue, green, and red light responsive optogenetic tools in bacteria, yeast, and mammalian cells and simplify the entrainment of cyanobacterial circadian rhythm. The LPA dramatically reduces the entry barrier to optogenetics and photobiology experiments.

Methods to Create and Control Shape Memory Alloy Wire Actuators as Reference Design for Makers	ADVANCED SCIENCE LETTERS			English	Proceedings Paper	8th National Conference on Thermophysical Properties (NCTP)	DEC 14-16, 2015	Jaipur, INDIA			Shape Memory Alloy Actuator; Maker; Maker Culture; Reference Design		Today, maker culture as an extension of DIY culture is rapidly spreading in the world with the advent of open source hardware. Makers currently learn and use practical skills based on different reference designs that are available to makers through the Internet. However, Reference design of SMAs for makers is not provided sufficiently despite commercial applications for shape memory alloys (SMAs) in different industrial fields. The objective of this research was to develop reference design for actuators based on SMA wires so that makers could easily and quickly utilize and learn. This research began by exploring different cases of actuators based on SMA wires. Through these case studies, we extracted essential parameters and classified cases into the essential parameters in order to develop reference design for actuators based on SMA wires. In order to prove the validity of reference design developed in this research, this reference design was subjected to experiments and tested.	[Jeon, B.; Choi, S.; Park, J.

An Embedded Systems Course for Engineering Students Using Open-Source Platforms in Wireless Scenarios	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION			English	Article						Cooperative/collaborative learning; engineering education; IEC 61160; innovation; open-source hardware; open-source software; teaching strategies		This paper presents a case study analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of using project-based learning (PBL) combined with collaborative learning (CL) and industry best practices, integrated with information communication technologies, open-source software, and open-source hardware tools, in a specialized microcontroller and embedded systems engineering Master's course. In addition to addressing industry requirements in both contents and methodology, the course develops capabilities and competencies in problem solving, independent learning, teamwork, and technical knowledge. Since PBL methodology alone does not ensure teamwork, it was complemented with CL. Design review meetings (as described in IEC 61160), deliverables, and organizational resources were also introduced to mirror industry demands. This structure integrated course content and student academic achievement in a simulated industrial environment. The course had students build a modular management system for home appliances, implementing control software on the "Arduino" open-source platform, as well as using wireless communications. The results show that teaching, learning, and student assessment processes can be improved by using PBL with CL. In addition, the introduction of industry practices, such us peer review meetings, brings academia closer to a real-world context.	[Rodriguez-Sanchez, M.

Citizen-based contributions can fill observational gaps and increase environmental stewardship amongst the public. For this purpose, tools and methods for citizen science need to (1) complement existing datasets; and (2) be affordable, while appealing to different user and developer groups. In this article, tools and methods developed in the 7th Framework Programme of European Union (EU FP 7) funded project Citclops (citizens' observatories for coast and ocean optical monitoring) are reviewed. Tools range from a stand-alone smartphone app to devices with Arduino and 3-D printing, and hence are attractive to a diversity of users; from the general public to more specified maker-and open labware movements. Standardization to common water quality parameters and methods allows long-term storage in regular marine data repositories, such as SeaDataNet and EMODnet, thereby providing open data access. Due to the given intercomparability to existing remote sensing datasets, these tools are ready to complement the marine datapool. In the future, such combined satellite and citizen observations may set measurements by the engaged public in a larger context and hence increase their individual meaning. In a wider sense, a synoptic use can support research, management authorities, and societies at large.

This study describes the development of an affordable and robust robotic beer pourer using low-cost sensors, Arduino (R) boards, Lego (R) building blocks and servo motors for prototyping. The RoboBEER is also coupled with video capture capabilities (iPhone 5S) and automated post hoc computer vision analysis algorithms to assess different parameters based on foamability, bubble size, alcohol content, temperature, carbon dioxide release and beer color. Results have shown that parameters obtained from different beers by only using the RoboBEER can be used for their classification according to quality and fermentation type. Results were compared to sensory analysis techniques using principal component analysis (PCA) and artificial neural networks (ANN) techniques. The PCA from RoboBEER data explained 73% of variability within the data. From sensory analysis, the PCA explained 67% of the variability and combining RoboBEER and Sensory data, the PCA explained only 59% of data variability. The ANN technique for pattern recognition allowed creating a classification model from the parameters obtained with RoboBEER, achieving 92.4% accuracy in the classification according to quality and fermentation type, which is consistent with the PCA results using data only from RoboBEER. The repeatability and objectivity of beer assessment offered by the RoboBEER could translate into the development of an important practical tool for food scientists, consumers and retail companies to determine differences within beers based on the specific parameters studied.

Despite technological advances and a need for methodological improvements, chromogenic and fluorogenic enzymatic techniques remain the mainstays of water quality monitoring for both public health agencies and regulated utilities. We demonstrated that bioelectroanalytical approaches to FIB enumeration are possible and can be achieved using commercially available enzyme-specific resorufin glycosides, although these are expensive, not widely available or designed for purpose. Following this, we designed two naphthoquinone glycosides which performed better, achieving Escherichia coli detection in the range 5.0x10(2) to 5.0x10(5) CFUml(-1) 22-54% quicker than commercially available resorufin glycosides. The molecular design of the naphthoquinone glycosides requires fewer synthetic steps allowing them to be produced for as little as US$50 per kg. Tests with environmental samples demonstrated the low tendency for abiotic interference and that, despite specificity being maintained between -glucuronidase and -galactosidase, accurate enumeration of E.coli in environmental samples necessitates development of a selective medium. In comparison to a commercially available detection method, which has U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approval, our approach performed better at high organism concentrations, detecting 500 organisms in 9h compared with 13.5h for the commercial method. Bioelectroanalytical detection is comparable to current approved methods and with further development could result in improved detection times. A recent trend for low-cost open-source hardware means that automated, potentiostatically controlled E.coli detection systems could be constructed for less than US$100 per channel.

Free and open-source automated 3-D microscope	JOURNAL OF MICROSCOPY			English	Article						3-D microscope; imaging; microscope; optics; open hardware; stage	SOURCE SOFTWARE-DEVELOPMENT; OPEN-SOURCE HARDWARE; PLATFORM; PRINTER	Open-source technology not only has facilitated the expansion of the greater research community, but by lowering costs it has encouraged innovation and customizable design. The field of automated microscopy has continued to be a challenge in accessibility due the expense and inflexible, noninterchangeable stages. This paper presents a low-cost, open-source microscope 3-D stage. A RepRap 3-D printer was converted to an optical microscope equipped with a customized, 3-D printed holder for a USB microscope. Precision measurements were determined to have an average error of 10 m at the maximum speed and 27 m at the minimum recorded speed. Accuracy tests yielded an error of 0.15%. The machine is a true 3-D stage and thus able to operate with USB microscopes or conventional desktop microscopes. It is larger than all commercial alternatives, and is thus capable of high-depth images over unprecedented areas and complex geometries. The repeatability is below 2-D microscope stages, but testing shows that it is adequate for the majority of scientific applications. The open-source microscope stage costs less than 3-9% of the closest proprietary commercial stages. This extreme affordability vastly improves accessibility for 3-D microscopy throughout the world. Lay description The concept of open-source technology stems from the developmental model of accessibility and ease of use, enabling an environment of continual improvement and open communication. This approach has the potential to dramatically change many fields of study including that of microscope use in research settings. Automated microscopy is often a challenging and inaccessible field due to the cost and non-interchangeable stages, the flat plate on which samples are placed for analysis. This paper presents a low-cost, open source microscope 3-D stage. A RepRap 3-D printer was converted to an optical microscope equipped with a customized, 3-D printed holder for a USB microscope. Precision measurements were determined to have an average error of 10 ?m at the maximum speed and 27 ?m at the minimum recorded speed. Accuracy tests yielded an error of 0.15%. The machine is a true 3-D stage and thus able to operate with USB microscopes or conventional desktop microscopes. Because it is larger than all current commercial alternative systems, it is capable of high depth images over unprecedented areas and complex geometries. The repeatibility is below 2-D microscope stages, but testing shows that it is adequate for the majority of scientific applications. The open source microscope stage costs less than 3% to 9% of the closest proprietary commercial stages. This extreme affordability vastly improves accessibility for 3-D microscopy throughout the world.

Analysis is usually performed through the liberation of the carbohydrate moieties from proteins, followed by fluorescent labeling and identification using either standardized HPLC or mass spectrometry techniques. A simple and robust automated process for the release and isolation of N-glycans would greatly improve analytical throughput and reproducibility, and is thus highly desirable. Inspired by the increasing number of reported projects involving open source labware, which allows the design and construction of otherwise inaccessible laboratory equipment using low-cost 3D printers, we used this technique to fabricate a platform for the automated isolation of N-glycans. As a proof of concept, we demonstrated the successful recovery of glycan samples from the glycoprotein model fetuin using our self-made 3D-printed equipment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

These datasets must be made publicly available for the community could validate and accept them. It is reasonable to concede that a collective, guided enterprise could serve to devise solid and substantial datasets, as a result of a collaborative effort, in the same sense as the open software community does. In this way datasets could be complemented, extended and expanded in size with, for example, more individuals, samples and human actions. For this to be possible some commitments must be made by the collaborators, being one of them sharing the same data acquisition platform. In this paper, we offer an affordable open source hardware and software platform based on inertial wearable sensors in a way that several groups could cooperate in the construction of datasets through common software suitable for collaboration. Some experimental results about the throughput of the overall system are reported showing the feasibility of acquiring data from up to 6 sensors with a sampling frequency no less than 118 Hz. Also, a proof-of-concept dataset is provided comprising sampled data from 12 subjects suitable for gait analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Therefore, monitoring parameters involved in the deterioration process, principally temperature and relative humidity, is useful for preventive conservation. In this study, a total of 15 microclimate stations using open source hardware were developed and stationed at the Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba, which is registered with UNESCO for its outstanding universal value, to assess the behavior of interior temperature and relative humidity in relation to exterior weather conditions, public hours and interior design. Long-term monitoring of these parameters is of interest in terms of preservation and reducing the costs of future conservation strategies. Results from monitoring are presented to demonstrate the usefulness of this system.

However, it has proved challenging to 3D print PDMS in complex structures due to its low elastic modulus and need for support during the printing process. Here we demonstrate the 3D printing of hydrophobic PDMS prepolymer resins within a hydrophilic Carbopol gel support via freeform reversible embedding (FRE). In the FRE printing process, the Carbopol support acts as a Bingham plastic that yields and fluidizes when the syringe tip of the 3D printer moves through it, but acts as a solid for the PDMS extruded within it. This, in combination with the immiscibility of hydrophobic PDMS in the hydrophilic Carbopol, confines the PDMS prepolymer within the support for curing times up to 72 h while maintaining dimensional stability. After printing and curing, the Carbopol support gel releases the embedded PDMS prints by using phosphate buffered saline solution to reduce the Carbopol yield stress. As proof-of-concept, we used Sylgard 184 PDMS to 3D print linear and helical filaments via continuous extrusion and cylindrical and helical tubes via layer-by-layer fabrication. Importantly, we show that the 3D printed tubes were manifold and perfusable. The results demonstrate that hydrophobic polymers with low viscosity and long cure times can be 3D printed using a hydrophilic support, expanding the range of biomaterials that can be used in additive manufacturing. Further, by implementing the technology using low cost open-source hardware and software tools, the FRE printing technique can be rapidly implemented for research applications.

Laminated micro-machine: Design and fabrication of a flexure-based Delta robot	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	44th North American Manufacturing Research Conference (NAMRC)	JUN 27-JUL 01, 2016	Virginia Polytechn & State Univ, Blacksburg, VA		Virginia Polytechn & State Univ	Laminated manufacturing; Delta robot; PC-MEMS		Mesoscale electromechanical systems find applications in fields such as medical instrumentation, soft robotics, microscopy, flexible electronics and imagining. This paper implements the printed circuit MEMS (PC-MEMS) process [1] for the fabrication of a 'pop-up' flexure-based mesoscale system that exploits the simplicity of 2-D manufacturing techniques such as sheet-metal operations and laser cutting to realize a 3-D mechanism. The fabrication of a laminated Delta robot with prismatic actuation is presented to exemplify this process. A working device with actuation and functional components such as linear guides, stepper motors and limit switches is designed and fully realized. Because the mechanism is popped out of the plane to achieve its 3D shape, we present a stiffness analysis to arrive at the out-of-plane (or 'pop-out') angles that the planar system must accommodate so that constraints/limits on actuator torque/force can be can satisfied while producing an operational system. The simplicity of the processes makes it a candidate for the use in the emerging open-source hardware technologies for fabricating low-cost, complex, electromechanical systems.

MultispeQ Beta: a tool for large-scale plant phenotyping connected to the open PhotosynQ network	ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE			English	Article						agriculture; chlorophyll fluorescence; open-source hardware; phenomics; photosynthesis	SUDDEN-DEATH SYNDROME; CYCLIC ELECTRON FLOW; CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; ABSORBENCY CHANGES; ATP SYNTHASE; STATE; LIGHT; ABSORPTION; EXCITATION; PHENOMICS	Large-scale high-throughput plant phenotyping (sometimes called phenomics) is becoming increasingly important in plant biology and agriculture and is essential to cutting-edge plant breeding and management approaches needed to meet the food and fuel needs for the next century. Currently, the application of these approaches is severely limited by the availability of appropriate instrumentation and by the ability to communicate experimental protocols, results and analyses. To address these issues, we have developed a low-cost, yet sophisticated open-source scientific instrument designed to enable communities of researchers, plant breeders, educators, farmers and citizen scientists to collect high-quality field data on a large scale. The MultispeQ provides measurements in the field or laboratory of both, environmental conditions (light intensity and quality, temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, time and location) and useful plant phenotypes, including photosynthetic parameters-photosystem II quantum yield (FII), non-photochemical exciton quenching (NPQ), photosystem II photoinhibition, light-driven proton translocation and thylakoid proton motive force, regulation of the chloroplast ATP synthase and potentially many others-and leaf chlorophyll and other pigments. Plant phenotype data are transmitted from the MultispeQ to mobile devices, laptops or desktop computers together with key metadata that gets saved to the PhotosynQ platform (https://photosynq.org) and provides a suite of web-based tools for sharing, visualization, filtering, dissemination and analyses. We present validation experiments, comparing MultispeQ results with established platforms, and show that it can be usefully deployed in both laboratory and field settings. We present evidence that MultispeQ can be used by communities of researchers to rapidly measure, store and analyse multiple environmental and plant properties, allowing for deeper understanding of the complex interactions between plants and their environment.

This paper provides an open source design for a laser polymer welding system, which can be fabricated with low-cost fused filament fabrication and off-the-shelf mechanical and electrical parts. The system is controlled with free and open source software and firmware. The operation of the machine is validated and the performance of the system is quantified for the mechanical properties (peak load) and weld width of linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) lap welds manufactured with the system as a function of linear energy density. The results provide incident laser power and machine parameters that enable both dual (two layers) and multilayer (three layers while welding only two sheets) polymer welded systems. The application of these parameter sets provides users of the open source laser polymer welder with the fundamental requirements to produce mechanically stable LLDPE multi-layer welded products, such as heat exchangers.

The signal goes first through an instrumentation amplifier, INA155, which is suitable for low amplitude signals like the seismic noise, and an anti-aliasing filter based on the MAX7404 switched-capacitor filter. After that, the amplified and filtered signal is digitized and processed by Arduino Due and registered in an SD memory card. Geophonino is configured for continuous registering, where the sampling frequency, the amplitude gain and the registering time are user-defined. The complete prototype is an open source and open hardware system. It has been tested by comparing the registered signals with the ones obtained through different commercial data recording systems and different kind of geophones. The obtained results show good correlation between the tested measurements, presenting Geophonino as a low-cost alternative system for seismic data recording. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast, it is not standard to demonstrate optical scattering experiments on the undergraduate level beyond simple diffraction gratings. We present an inexpensive Mie scattering setup manufactured with 3D printing and open hardware. The experiment can be used to determine the particle size in dilute monodisperse colloidal suspensions with surprisingly high accuracy and is, thus, suitable to demonstrate relations between scattering measurements and microscopic properties of particles within undergraduate lab course projects.

However, more information has not translated into a greater understanding of disease complexity to satisfy diagnostic and therapeutic needs. Challenges include noncompatible technology platforms, the need for wide-scale and long-term deployment of sensor technology (among vulnerable elderly patients in particular), and the gap between the big data acquired with sensitive measurement technologies and their limited clinical application. Major opportunities could be realized if new technologies are developed as part of open-source and/or open-hardware platforms that enable multichannel data capture sensitive to the broad range of motor and nonmotor problems that characterize PD and are adaptable into self-adjusting, individualized treatment delivery systems. The International Parkinson and Movement Disorders Society Task Force on Technology is entrusted to convene engineers, clinicians, researchers, and patients to promote the development of integrated measurement and closed-loop therapeutic systems with high patient adherence that also serve to (1) encourage the adoption of clinico-pathophysiologic phenotyping and early detection of critical disease milestones, (2) enhance the tailoring of symptomatic therapy, (3) improve subgroup targeting of patients for future testing of disease-modifying treatments, and (4) identify objective biomarkers to improve the longitudinal tracking of impairments in clinical care and research. This article summarizes the work carried out by the task force toward identifying challenges and opportunities in the development of technologies with potential for improving the clinical management and the quality of life of individuals with PD.

Frugal Droplet Microfluidics Using Consumer Opto-Electronics	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MANIPULATION	The maker movement has shown how off-the-shelf devices can be combined to perform operations that, until recently, required expensive specialized equipment. Applying this philosophy to microfluidic devices can play a fundamental role in disseminating these technologies outside specialist labs and into industrial use. Here we show how nanoliter droplets can be manipulated using a commercial DVD writer, interfaced with an Arduino electronic controller. We couple the optical setup with a droplet generation and manipulation device based on the "confinement gradients" approach. This device uses regions of different depths to generate and transport the droplets, which further simplifies the operation and reduces the need for precise flow control. The use of robust consumer electronics, combined with open source hardware, leads to a great reduction in the price of the device, as well as its footprint, without reducing its performance compared with the laboratory setup.

Functionally and energy optimized hardware systems and development tools maybe is the most critical facet of this technology for the achievement of such prospects. Especially, in the area of agriculture, where the hostile operating environment comes to add to the general technological and technical issues, reliable and robust WSAN systems are mandatory. This paper focuses on the hardware design architectures of the WSANs for real-world agricultural applications. It presents the available alternatives in hardware design and identifies their difficulties and problems for real-life implementations. The paper introduces SensoTube, a new WSAN hardware architecture, which is proposed as a solution to the various existing design constraints of WSANs. The establishment of the proposed architecture is based, firstly on an abstraction approach in the functional requirements context, and secondly, on the standardization of the subsystems connectivity, in order to allow for an open, expandable, flexible, reconfigurable, energy optimized, reliable and robust hardware system. The SensoTube implementation reference model together with its encapsulation design and installation are analyzed and presented in details. Furthermore, as a proof of concept, certain use cases have been studied in order to demonstrate the benefits of migrating existing designs based on the available open-source hardware platforms to SensoTube architecture.

J	Coakley, M; Hurt, DE				Coakley, Meghan; Hurt, Darrell E.			3D Printing in the Laboratory: Maximize Time and Funds with Customized and Open-Source Labware	JALA			English	Article						3D printing; computer-assisted design; prototyping; equipment		3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, is the computer-guided process of fabricating physical objects by depositing successive layers of material. It has transformed manufacturing across virtually every industry, bringing about incredible advances in research and medicine. The rapidly growing consumer market now includes convenient and affordable desktop 3D printers. These are being used in the laboratory to create custom 3D-printed equipment, and a growing community of designers are contributing open-source, cost-effective innovations that can be used by both professionals and enthusiasts. User stories from investigators at the National Institutes of Health and the biomedical research community demonstrate the power of 3D printing to save valuable time and funding. While adoption of 3D printing has been slow in the biosciences to date, the potential is vast. The market predicts that within several years, 3D printers could be commonplace within the home; with so many practical uses for 3D printing, we anticipate that the technology will also play an increasingly important role in the laboratory. ?? ?????????????3D?????????????????????????????????????????????????3D printing????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????3D?????????????????????????????3D?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????3D????????????????????????????3D??????????????????????????????????????????3D????????????????????????????????3D?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ?? ?? ????? ??? 3D ???? ??? ???? ?? ???? ?? ??? ???? ??? ?? ??? ???????. ? ??? ?? ?? ??? ?? ?? ??? ??? ???? ??? ?? ??? ??? ??? ??? ????. ??? ???? ??? ??? ?? ???? ??? ???? 3D ???? ???????. ??? ??? 3D ?? ??? ??? ?? ????? ???? ???, ???? ???? ????? ??? ? ??? ??? ??? ? ?? ?? ??? ?????? ??? ???? ????. ?? ???(National Institutes of Health)? ????? ?? ?????? ??? ?? ???, 3D ??? ??? ?? ??? ??? ??? ??? ? ??? ?????. ???? 3D ???? ?????? ??? ?????? ???? ?????. ??? ? ? ??? 3D ???? ?? ??? ???? ??? ?????. ??? ?? 3D ??? ?? ??? ??, ? ??? ?????? ?? ? ??? ??? ? ??? ?????. ?? 3D ??,???????,??????????????????????????????????????????????,?????????????????,???????3D ??????????????????????,????????? 3D ????,???????????????????????,???????????????,??????????????????(National Institutes of Health)??????????????????????,3D ?????????????????????,?? 3D ????????????????,?????????????????,?????,3D ??????????????? 3D ??????,????,??,????,?????????????????? ?? 3D ?????????,???????????????????????????????????????????,?????????????????,?????????3D ??????????????????????,????????? 3D ????,??????????????????????????,???????????????,??????????????????

Open-Source Wax RepRap 3-D Printer for Rapid Prototyping Paper-Based Microfluidics	JALA			English	Article						3-D printing; wax; paper-based microfluidics; lab-on-a-chip; electrochemical detection	OPEN-SOURCE HARDWARE; CHEMICAL-SYNTHESIS; DEVICES; REACTIONWARE; PLATFORM; ELECTRODES; SENSORS	The open-source release of self-replicating rapid prototypers (RepRaps) has created a rich opportunity for low-cost distributed digital fabrication of complex 3-D objects such as scientific equipment. For example, 3-D printable reactionware devices offer the opportunity to combine open hardware microfluidic handling with lab-on-a-chip reactionware to radically reduce costs and increase the number and complexity of microfluidic applications. To further drive down the cost while improving the performance of lab-on-a-chip paper-based microfluidic prototyping, this study reports on the development of a RepRap upgrade capable of converting a Prusa Mendel RepRap into a wax 3-D printer for paper-based microfluidic applications. An open-source hardware approach is used to demonstrate a 3-D printable upgrade for the 3-D printer, which combines a heated syringe pump with the RepRap/Arduino 3-D control. The bill of materials, designs, basic assembly, and use instructions are provided, along with a completely free and open-source software tool chain. The open-source hardware device described here accelerates the potential of the nascent field of electrochemical detection combined with paper-based microfluidics by dropping the marginal cost of prototyping to nearly zero while accelerating the turnover between paper-based microfluidic designs.

Open-source, self-replicating 3-D printer factory for small-business manufacturing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						3-D printing; RepRap; Entrepreneurship; Disruptive innovation; Distributed manufacturing; Business model	OPEN-SOURCE HARDWARE; POLYMER; REPRAP; COST	Additive manufacturing with 3-D printers may be a key technology enabler for entrepreneurs seeking to use disruptive innovations such as business models utilizing distributed manufacturing. Unlike centralized manufacturing, distributed manufacturing makes the parts and products (the prints) at (or closer to) the source of the demand, cutting out much of the traditional supply chain. Although many expect 3-D printing to take off at the household level and previous work has shown significant returns for those choosing to do so, there are still significant barriers to entry for typical consumers. Our analysis demonstrates that for an individual to make an abnormally high return on their investments in 3-D printers, they must serve others to achieve high utilization rates. The impetus to do so is created by a service that can undercut traditionally manufactured products due to affordability and customizability. Low-cost, open-source 3-D printers are now priced within range of individual entrepreneurs who can take advantage of the long tail of consumers with highly varied interests. The margin advantage, net present value, and return on investment (ROI) analysis provided herein could form the basis of thousands of new small-business ventures in the coming years.

Open ISEmeter: An open hardware high-impedance interface for potentiometric detection	REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS			English	Article							FLOW-INJECTION-ANALYSIS; ELECTRODES; SYSTEM; SENSOR; PH; CHLORIDE; FIA	In this work, a new open hardware interface based on Arduino to read electromotive force (emf) from potentiometric detectors is presented. The interface has been fully designed with the open code philosophy and all documentation will be accessible on web. The paper describes a comprehensive project including the electronic design, the firmware loaded on Arduino, and the Java-coded graphical user interface to load data in a computer (PC or Mac) for processing. The prototype was tested by measuring the calibration curve of a detector. As detection element, an active poly(vinyl chloride)based membrane was used, doped with cetyltrimethylammonium dodecylsulphate (CTA(+)-DS-). The experimental measures of emf indicate Nernstian behaviour with the CTA(+) content of test solutions, as it was described in the literature, proving the validity of the developed prototype. A comparative analysis of performance was made by using the same chemical detector but changing the measurement instrumentation. Published by AIP Publishing.	[Salvador, C.; Carbajo, J.; Mozo, J.

Accessible bioprinting: adaptation of a low-cost 3D-printer for precise cell placement and stem cell differentiation	BIOFABRICATION			English	Article						induced pluripotent stem cells; bioprinting; tissue engineering; 3D differentiation; open labware; 3D printing	TISSUE-ENGINEERED CONSTRUCTS; SCAFFOLDS; VIABILITY; FABRICATION; DESIGN; FLOW; HYDROGEL; IMPACT; DAMAGE	The precision and repeatability offered by computer-aided design and computer-numerically controlled techniques in biofabrication processes is quickly becoming an industry standard. However, many hurdles still exist before these techniques can be used in research laboratories for cellular and molecular biology applications. Extrusion-based bioprinting systems have been characterized by high development costs, injector clogging, difficulty achieving small cell number deposits, decreased cell viability, and altered cell function post-printing. To circumvent the high-price barrier to entry of conventional bioprinters, we designed and 3D printed components for the adaptation of an inexpensive 'off-the-shelf' commercially available 3D printer. We also demonstrate via goal based computer simulations that the needle geometries of conventional commercially standardized, 'luer-lock' syringe-needle systems cause many of the issues plaguing conventional bioprinters. To address these performance limitations we optimized flow within several microneedle geometries, which revealed a short tapered injector design with minimal cylindrical needle length was ideal to minimize cell strain and accretion. We then experimentally quantified these geometries using pulled glass microcapillary pipettes and our modified, low-cost 3D printer. This systems performance validated our models exhibiting: reduced clogging, single cell print resolution, and maintenance of cell viability without the use of a sacrificial vehicle. Using this system we show the successful printing of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into Geltrex and note their retention of a pluripotent state 7 d post printing. We also show embryoid body differentiation of hiPSC by injection into differentiation conducive environments, wherein we observed continuous growth, emergence of various evaginations, and post-printing gene expression indicative of the presence of all three germ layers. These data demonstrate an accessible open-source 3D bioprinter capable of serving the needs of any laboratory interested in 3D cellular interactions and tissue engineering.

An Open Sensing and Acting Platform for Context-Aware Affective Support in Ambient Intelligent Educational Settings	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL			English	Article						Affective computing; emotion recognition; sensor systems; continuing education; open systems	SENSORS	Supporting learners affectively while carrying out stressful educational activities is an open research issue. It requires the appropriate infrastructure for recognizing emotional states and reacting accordingly in runtime. In this paper, we describe the open platform that we have implemented (named AICARP v2) to detect changes in physiological signals that can be associated with stressful situations, and when this happens, it recommends the learner to relax by delivering modulated sensorial support in terms of light, sound, or vibration at a relaxation breath rate. In this way, by taking advantage of ambient intelligence, the learner can perceive the recommended action without interrupting the learning activity (in this case, practicing the oral exam of a second language). The signal acquisition of the system (which combines sensors from Libellium e-Health platform with others integrated ad hoc) has been compared with a commercial system (J&J Engineering I-330-C2), obtaining similar outcomes as to identifying significant changes in the physiological signals when the learner experiments an emotional reaction. However, the cost of AICARP v2 is much lower, and at the same time, it is open hardware and flexible and, thus, has the advantage of providing runtime data processing.

This paper introduces a design for a low-cost smart meter system as well as explaining fundamentals of smart metering. The smart meter platform, provided as open hardware, is designed with a connector interface compatible to the Arduino platform, thus opening the possibilities for smart meters with flexible hardware and computation features, starting from low-cost 8 bitmicro controllers up to powerful single board computers that can run Linux. The metering platform features a current transformer which allows a non-intrusive installation of the current measurement unit. The suggested design can switch loads, offers a variable sampling frequency, and provides measurement data such as active power, reactive and apparent power. Results indicate that measurement accuracy and resolution of the proposed metering platform are sufficient for a range of different applications and loads from a few watts up to 5 kW.

Arthroscopic Removal of Symptomatic Proximal Humerus Locking Plates With Bone-Void Filler Augmentation	ARTHROSCOPY TECHNIQUES			English	Article							FRACTURES; FIXATION	Open reduction internal fixation of proximal humerus fractures is often accomplished with proximal humerus locking plates. While these plates have a good track record, they can become symptomatic and require removal once the fracture has healed. Open hardware removal is associated with a number of additional risks to the patient, including infection, scarring, nerve damage, and blood loss. In addition, the recovery time after open hardware removal may be prolonged, thereby predisposing the patient to postoperative stiffness. The purpose of this article is to describe a technique for removing proximal humerus locking plates arthroscopically. Although technically demanding, the benefits of this technique include smaller incisions, quicker recovery time, decreased risk of infection, and reduced blood loss. Arthroscopy also provides the surgeon with the ability to address concomitant intra-articular pathology at the time of surgery. Additionally, we use a bone-void filler to reduce the risk of fracture through stress caused by previous screw holes.

The widespread availability of open-source hardware together with novel analytical methods based on pulsed flows have opened the possibility of implementing standalone automated analytical systems at low cost. Among the areas that can benefit from this approach are the analysis of industrial products and effluents and environmental analysis. In this work, a multi-pumping flow system is proposed for the determination of phosphorus in effluents and polluted water samples. The system employs photometric detection based on the formation of molybdovanadophosphoric acid, and the fluidic circuit is built using three solenoid micropumps. The detection is implemented with a low cost LED-photodiode photometric detection system and the whole system is controlled by an open-source Arduino Uno microcontroller board. The optimization of the timing to ensure the color development and the pumping cycle is discussed for the proposed implementation. Experimental results to evaluate the system behavior are presented verifying a linear relationship between the relative absorbance and the phosphorus concentrations for levels as high as 50 mg L-1.

Return on investment for open source scientific hardware development	SCIENCE AND PUBLIC POLICY			English	Article						open hardware; science policy; return on investment; free and open source hardware; free hardware; open source	MICROSCOPY PLATFORM	The availability of free and open source hardware designs that can be replicated with low-cost 3D printers provides large values to scientists who need highly-customized low-volume production scientific equipment. Digital manufacturing technologies have only recently become widespread and the return on investment (ROI) was not clear, so funding for open hardware development was historically sparse. This paper clarifies a method for determining an ROI for the development of scientific free and open source hardware (FOSH). By using an open source hardware design that can be manufactured digitally, the relatively minor development costs result in enormous ROIs for the scientific community. A case study is presented of a syringe pump released under open license, which results in ROIs for funders ranging from hundreds to thousands of percent after only a few months. It is clear that policies encouraging FOSH scientific hardware development should be adopted by organizations interested in maximizing return on public investments for science.	[Pearce, J.

Due to the flexibility of the hardware, firmware, and software architectures, the platform is capable of interfacing with a wide variety of detector modules not only in medical imaging but also in homeland security applications. Analog signals from radiation detectors share similar characteristics-a pulse whose area is proportional to the deposited energy and whose leading edge is used to extract a timing signal. As a result, a generic design method of the platform is adopted for the hardware, firmware, and software architectures and implementations. The analog front-end is hosted on a module called a Detector Board, where each board can filter, combine, timestamp, and process multiple channels independently. The processed data is formatted and sent through a backplane bus to a module called Support Board, where 1 Support Board can host up to eight Detector Board modules. The data in the Support Board, coming from 8 Detector Board modules, can be aggregated or correlated (if needed) depending on the algorithm implemented or runtime mode selected. It is then sent out to a computer workstation for further processing. The number of channels (detector modules), to be processed, mandates the overall OpenPET System Configuration, which is designed to handle up to 1,024 channels using 16-channel Detector Boards in the Standard System Configuration and 16,384 channels using 32-channel Detector Boards in the Large System Configuration.

The dependability of the Internet of Things is critical because the services will be concerned with real life. However, the inexpensive hardware provides limited resources for communication. In this paper, we present exact all-terminal reliability of the wireless networks of which the number of links of each node is bounded. First, we analyze the all-terminal reliability of the regular wireless network, where any two nodes are connected by a wireless link consisting of a pair of radio modules. The reliability polynomial is derived from the Tutte polynomial that is the seminal work of the algebraic graph theory. Second, we analyze the all-terminal reliability of the wireless network including the random mesh network under the assumption that if the module fails, all radio links connected through a radio module are cut off. We consider both the fault of the communication module and the fading of the wireless channel in the indoor channel condition. For improving the reliability, we also propose a fault-tolerant method giving redundant radio modules into each node. We also analyze cost-effectiveness. We also calculate the mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) for wireless networks. We show that the random mesh network of which each node includes three or more the radio-broadcast modules is more dependable than any other regular network of which each node comprises four point-to-point modules if it is the connected graph in the static environment.

Several commercial hardware and software solutions for the realization of such monitoring measurements are available on the market. In addition to them, a research team at the University of Applied Sciences in Neubrandenburg (NUAS) is actively developing a software package for monitoring purposes in geodesy and geotechnics, which is distributed under an open source licence and free of charge. The task of managing an open source project is well-known in computer science, but it is fairly new in a geodetic context. This paper contributes to that issue by detailing applications, frameworks, and interfaces for the design and implementation of open hardware and software solutions for sensor control, sensor networks, and data management in automatic deformation monitoring. It will be discussed how the development effort of networked applications can be reduced by using free programming tools, cloud computing technologies, and rapid prototyping methods.

One parameter to assess the water transparency is the diffuse attenuation coefficient. However, the number of subsurface irradiance measurements obtained with conventional instrumentation is relatively low, due to instrument costs and the logistic requirements to provide regular and autonomous observations. In recent years, the citizen science concept has increased the number of environmental observations, both in time and space. The recent technological advances in embedded systems and sensors also enable volunteers (citizens) to create their own devices (known as Do-It-Yourself or DIY technologies). In this paper, a DIY instrument to measure irradiance at different depths and automatically calculate the diffuse attenuation K-d coefficient is presented. The instrument, named KdUINO, is based on an encapsulated low-cost photonic sensor and Arduino (an open-hardware platform for the data acquisition). The whole instrument has been successfully operated and the data validated comparing the KdUINO measurements with the commercial instruments. Workshops have been organized with high school students to validate its feasibility.

This paper describes a recipe for the design, development, and deployment of a low-cost environmental data logging and transmission system for environmental sensors and its connection to an open source data-sharing network. The hardware is built using several low-cost, open-source, mass-produced components. The system automatically ingests data into HydroServer, a standards-based server in the open source hydrologic information system (HIS) created by the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Sciences Inc. (CUAHSI). By publishing data in this way, they are discoverable through the geographic information system (GIS)-based CUAHSI tools, HydroDesktop and HydroShare. In addition, because they follow WaterML encoding, open hardware data stored in the HIS can be included in international catalog such as the global earth observation system of system catalog.

It is autonomous (runs off the bike battery), replicable (open source and open hardware), scalable (different fleet sizes) and modular (sensors can be added), so it can be used for further research and development. The system monitors location (global positioning system), rider control data (level of assistance) and other custom sensor input in real time. The SEMS data feeds an online interface for data analysis, for riders to view their own data and for sharing on social media. The basic system can be replicated by other researchers and can be extended with modules to explore various issues in e-bike research. The source code and hardware design are publicly available, under the General Public License, for non-commercial use. SEMS was implemented on 30 bikes and collected data during 10 months of real-word trials in the UK. This study details the design and implementation of the hardware and software, discusses the system use and explores features for future design iterations. The SEMS turns singular e-bikes into a networked fleet and is an example of the internet of things in the cycling context.

A one-piece 3D printed flexure translation stage for open-source microscopy	REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	16th International Conference on Ion Sources (ICIS)	AUG 23-28, 2015	New York, NY	Brookhaven Natl Lab, Collider Accelerator Dept			OPTICAL TWEEZERS; HINGES; INTENSITY; DIAGNOSIS; LENSES	Open source hardware has the potential to revolutionise the way we build scientific instruments; with the advent of readily available 3D printers, mechanical designs can now be shared, improved, and replicated faster and more easily than ever before. However, printed parts are typically plastic and often perform poorly compared to traditionally machined mechanisms. We have overcome many of the limitations of 3D printed mechanisms by exploiting the compliance of the plastic to produce a monolithic 3D printed flexure translation stage, capable of sub-micron-scale motion over a range of 8 x 8 x 4 mm. This requires minimal post-print clean-up and can be automated with readily available stepper motors. The resulting plastic composite structure is very stiff and exhibits remarkably low drift, moving less than 20 mu m over the course of a week, without temperature stabilisation. This enables us to construct a miniature microscope with excellent mechanical stability, perfect for time-lapse measurements in situ in an incubator or fume hood. The ease of manufacture lends itself to use in containment facilities where disposability is advantageous and to experiments requiring many microscopes in parallel. High performance mechanisms based on printed flexures need not be limited to microscopy, and we anticipate their use in other devices both within the laboratory and beyond. (C) 2016 Author(s).

Snowball sampling was used in this study to survey 300 people who work and have had experiences with online brand communities for open source hardware (OSHW) at Fab Lab Seoul. The findings of this study indicate that content, consumer support, user interface, and reward are among the five factors that trigger an online brand community to develop a social OSHW platform. However, this study also found that brand reputation was insignificant relative to activating a social media platform for open-source software. In addition, activating a social platform for OSHW can positively affect to the brand community's loyalty for OSHW, which means that social platform innovation for OSHW can help form the positive attitude necessary to develop and diffuse an OSHW culture in a rapidly changing ICT ecosystem. This can be an important strategy for OSHW business and can contribute to the growth of the IoT market in South Korea. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The platform proposed here is intended for research which trades smaller population size with more sophisticated individual robot capabilities. The validation of proposed swarm robotic algorithms using real-world hardware is essential, but is fraught with difficulty due to the expense and complexity of developing and maintaining multiple operational units. A number of open hardware platforms have been proposed, although most prioritize small size and low cost over advanced capabilities such as vision. We are interested in a number of different research directions which utilize vision as a core capability and find the existing open hardware platforms to be insufficient (and existing commercial platforms too expensive). In this paper we describe a set of desirable characteristics for an open, extensible visually-guided robot platform. We then present our solution, the BuPiGo (pronounced buppy-go), describing the hardware itself and a model developed for simulation purposes. We also present some initial results on using the BuPiGo for visual homing an individual navigation task that we hope to exploit for swarm tasks in the future.

With the widespread availability of low-cost open source hardware and free open source software, robotics has become central to the promotion of STEM education in schools, and active learning at college/university level. With robots, children in developed countries gain from technological immersion, or exposure to the latest technologies and gadgets. Yet, developing countries like India still lag in the use of robots at school and even college level. In this paper, an innovative and low-cost educational outdoor mobile robot is developed for deployment by school children during volunteer trash pickup. The wheeled mobile robot is constructed with inexpensive commercial off-the-shelf components, including single board computer and miscellaneous sensors. It is remote controlled by children using smart phone app or video game controller. The robot is also equipped with air quality sensors to display air pollution levels to the children and public. The project can improve STEM education, environmental literacy and civic engagement among school children, while providing interdisciplinary service learning opportunities for college and university students. Results of a prototype mobile robot design, development, and deployment are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.

Recording from dozens to hundreds of electrodes is today routine; novel means of manipulating the system in real time, through electrical stimulation, optogenetics or sensory manipulation are allowing us to decipher neural circuit function at an unparalleled rate. To contribute to the wide dissemination of such techniques, we present an open hardware project, High-Channel Count Electrophysiology (HiCCE), aiming to produce low-cost, high-channel count (>= 128 channels) electrophysiology instrumentation capable of fast data acquisition rates, real-time processing and feedback capabilities. Our design is centered on an open standard, FPGA Mezzanine Card (FMC), which permits a varied choice of FPGA carrier architectures suited to different laboratory experimental needs. The HiCCE-128, a low-cost high-performance 128-channel data acquisition board for small voltage signals, is being introduced. It is a FMC module that can be operated from any FPGA carrier conforming to the FMC/VITA57 standard. This specialized board with a low input referred noise of about 3 mu V is capable of acquiring 128 channels simultaneously at 31.25 kS/s per channel with 16 effective bits of resolution. We present the global architecture and some preliminary measurement to illustrate its potential for electrophysiological and medical applications.

It has chosen as study case, the teaching of Python language due to versatility, structure and robustness that this language provides in the design and construction of hardware and software elements in devices such as Arduino or Raspberry PI. However, this methodology can be employed in the teaching of other type of programming languages such as C, Java, or Dart. It has selected as educational framework of the methodology some sections of the model known as Stage Self Direct Learning (SSDL) which provides a conceptual base that serves as reference model allowing to build a methodology in which the students will be participant of their own educational process. In order to enhance the learning process in the students, in the structure of course, it has designed an e-learning course taking as platform to ILIAS (Integriertes Lern-, Informations-und Arbeitskooperations-System). It is an open source platform with some features such as Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) resources, forums, surveys, taxonomy services, exercises and assessment. During the development of course, different kinds of resources were created and shared through this platform, these were subject to discussion providing a space for the exchange of ideas and experiences associated with the main topics of this course. The methodology established allowed to encourage the interest of the students in the learning and use of programming languages as likewise using them in the design of projects that require the use of open hardware resources.

Existing literature in the Internet of Things (IoT) landscape detail opportunities and difficulties, but performance data to evaluate the overheads and suitability of services provisioning for industrial applications is not readily available. So, we designed and developed a General Telematic Framework for Rapid Application Development using Service-Oriented Architectural (SOA) principles and then provisioned services used in typical CPSS environments on embedded Raspberry Pi hardware modules.

Correspondingly, we can observe (new) modes of value creation that put into question traditional economic strategies and assumptions by stressing collaboration instead of competition and knowledge sharing instead of black box engineering. Open Source Ecology (OSE) is a famous example of a nonprofit organization which fosters worldwide participation and collaboration to jointly develop open source hardware for operation in both developing and industrialized countries. Based on the concepts open source appropriate technology (OSAT), the community aims at the free access to the knowledge and knowhow of low-cost and easy-to-build products to empower people to build and run a civilization. This case study describes and analyzes the value creation processes of OSE and derives new opportunities for business models based on openness.

Multirotors are particularly versatile platforms which offer some clear advantages for marine-based research missions including mapping and surveying of coastal, glacial, or marine features, photogrammetry, remote atmospheric or water sample collection, specimen tracking, and rare-event monitoring. The Olin College Intelligent Vehicle Laboratory has been actively developing on multirotor platforms to autonomously perform these missions, with special focus on photogrammetric and breath condensate sample collection from cetaceans. A critical part of our work is the design of an intelligent controller which will allow the multirotor to land on the deck of a research vessel or vessel of opportunity following the completion of a mission. A central control computer that may be located on the vessel will call the multirotor to return to the research vessel's deck, which has continued to travel during the mission. A global positioning system (GPS) attached to a specialized platform on the deck of the boat provides the current position of the landing platform to the multirotor. Once the multirotor arrives above the perceived location of the landing platform, a downward facing camera mounted onto the vehicle is used to identify a fiducial element that is located on the platform. Using the fiducial element and known state of the vehicle, a visual surveying methodology is used to allow the vehicle to land accurately on the specialized landing platform. Unlike in most simulated or controlled environments, the deck of a vessel of opportunity can move unpredictably in 5 axes (roll, pitch, yaw, longitudinal, latitudinal) due to oceanic characteristics and weather conditions. At present, trained multirotor pilots are the standard for controlling air vehicles, especially under these conditions. The scalability, risk, and cost of using a highly skilled human pilot limits the usefulness of these platforms in large-scale research missions. We are aiming to minimize the cost and risk associated with these platforms by making them accessible to untrained pilots as well as allowing for use of multiple platforms at one time and allowing for easy design of missions that the vehicle can conduct semi-supervised. Beyond obvious physical changes to the multirotor, including reinforcing structures or waterproofing, the multirotor itself must behave adaptively and sensitively to its environment. Our multirotors are equipped with the open hardware/software PixHawk autopilot system, which automatically rejects small environmental disturbances and provides telemetry data, such as GPS position and state of the vehicle which we use for our controller. A camera mounted to a stabilizing gimbal at the nose of the multirotor captures HD images, and a wireless video link transmits these images and the data from the autopilot to the vessel-mounted computer for processing. Our landing platform is also equipped with a GPS and streams information to the central computer. Two types of error are calculated by the computer: macro-error and micro-error. Macro-error refers to the gross positions of the landing platform and the vehicle using GPS signals. Microerror refers to the position of the vehicle in reference to the position of the landing platform fiducial element. These are used to determine the appropriate thrust and directional vectors to give to the vehicle to make a successful landing. In Spring of 2016, we implemented successful fiducial identification using computer vision techniques which extract vehicle state and image information to determine relative location of the vehicle to a known fiducial. Using this, we have developed a preliminary controller which allows for station-keeping of the vehicle above an identified fiducial on the ground. In the Summer of 2016, we will continue to develop the control scheme for fiducial identification, vehicle navigation, and landing procedure through field tests at locations including Buzzards Bay, Lake Waban, and the Gloucester Harbor. Our technology depends upon, and is itself, open-source. This allows for rapid iteration of controller design and means that what we develop can be made widely available to the marineresearch community for immediate use or customization. By putting these powerful tools in the hands of marine researchers, the need for completing missions manually can be eliminated. Landing on a vessel of opportunity is a significant step towards fully autonomous aerial instrumentation for marine-based research.

Within this context, the farm's management decisions include information from data collected about the crops health development, which need to be gathered in a timely basis. There are several means of obtaining information about the plants health, including manual data collection from sensors installed in the soil and/or its vicinity, mobile sensor systems, for example embedded sensors in UAVs, or aircrafts, or other vehicles, and satellite imagery, to name just a few examples. The adoption of UAVs in such applications has gaining a lot of attention in recent years due to ease of access, low cost and available flight control software. UAV systems may carry several sensors, which include RGB, infrared, multispectral and hyper-spectral cameras. These cameras are respectively more powerful, in terms of data quality, as well as more expensive. The current paper contribution include the platform model, design and characterization of a multispectral camera system made from two low cost, commercial of the shelf cameras that can be integrated in a small UAV. These aforementioned cameras are compatible with open source hardware, namely Raspberry Pi boards, that are used to collect, process and store information.

Children and youth are fascinated by mechanisms, machines and robots. Therefore, robotics using inexpensive open source hardware and software is increasingly being used in innovative STEM education. But, developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America are well behind the curve in the use of robots in schools and colleges. An innovative and extremely affordable robotic system is developed in this paper, whereby school children anywhere can go online and race multiple indoor mobile robots over the Internet. Virtual reality and force feedback are used to make the racing realistic and interactive. Children will be introduced to building their own inexpensive mobile robots using commercial, off-the-shelf components and materials. Advanced learners, e.g., college and university students, can modify and improve the hardware and software for Internet-based teleoperation. The project can be used to introduce or improve robotics education at a low cost among school children, while providing opportunities in service learning for college/university students.	[Harini, V.

Its urgency is due to the incorporation need of the numerous advances in mobile robotics to the area of the Assistive Technologies, and more specifically in the field of the so called Intelligent Wheelchairs (IW). In this paper we propose a common core for IWs based both on an open robotic platform and an open and a well extended software for robotics (ROS "Robotic Operating System"). Such an IW core has got a distributed architecture whose processing nodes are linked through a CAN standard bus, which connects the low level control functions based on low cost and highly portable Cortex platforms. This paper describes also the autonomous navigation algorithm developed for the Intelligent Wheelchair by using an Extended Kalman Filter. In the chosen approach the absolute position of the IW (a mobile robot) is estimated using sensor fusion which combines data from two of the sensory systems included in the described open platform: the dead-reckoning system and a visual system based on QR landmarks located on the ceiling. Within this context, the paper demonstrates the potential of the platform proposal in relation to the quick and easy incorporation of recent advances in mobile robotics.

Timeline: An Operating System Abstraction for Time-Aware Applications	PROCEEDINGS OF 2016 IEEE REAL-TIME SYSTEMS SYMPOSIUM (RTSS)			English	Proceedings Paper	37th IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS)	NOV 29-DEC 02, 2016	Porto, PORTUGAL	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, IEEE Tech Comm Real Time Syst				Having a shared and accurate sense of time is critical to distributed Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the Internet of Things (IoT). Thanks to decades of research in clock technologies and synchronization protocols, it is now possible to measure and synchronize time across distributed systems with unprecedented accuracy. However, applications have not benefited to the same extent due to limitations of the system services that help manage time, and hardware-OS and OS-application interfaces through which timing information flows to the application. Due to the importance of time awareness in a broad range of emerging applications, running on commodity platforms and operating systems, it is imperative to rethink how time is handled across the system stack. We advocate the adoption of a holistic notion of Quality of Time (QoT) that captures metrics such as resolution, accuracy, and stability. Building on this notion we propose an architecture in which the local perception of time is a controllable operating system primitive with observable uncertainty, and where time synchronization balances applications' timing demands with system resources such as energy and bandwidth. Our architecture features an expressive application programming interface that is centered around the abstraction of a timeline -a virtual temporal coordinate frame that is defined by an application to provide its components with a shared sense of time, with a desired accuracy and resolution. The timeline abstraction enables developers to easily write applications whose activities are choreographed across time and space. Leveraging open source hardware and software components, we have implemented an initial Linux realization of the proposed timeline-driven QoT stack on a standard embedded computing platform. Results from its evaluation are also presented.

However, the availability of developer tools is lacking in comparison with the development of sensor devices. This shortcoming has been partially addressed by the introduction of open source hardware but it is difficult to develop applications using this alone.

The proposed data acquisition (DAQ) system has features that it uses the framed data protocol based on hex encoding, it can acquire multiple data which are not of the same type at different sample rates, and the system receives data through USB communication or serial communication. The software of the proposed system consists of the firmware of a microcontroller and user-defined Simulink function block. The firmware of a microcontroller is in the form of a header file, and the data acquisition can be easily achieved by calling a few functions defined in the header file. The developed user-defined Simulink block can get multiple data at different sample rates by configuring the GUI parameters appropriately. For implementation of the system, we use the Arch Max, which is the open-source hardware with an ARM Cortex-M4 core, and also use a user-defined c-code S-function of Matlab/Simulink. For the demonstration of the superiority of the implemented system, we compare the proposed system's performance with that of the data acquisition system provided in Matlab/Simulink Instrument Control Toolbox. Finally we illustrate how presented system can be actually used by applying the proposed system to DC motor control.

A key difference between such systems and the human visual system is that the latter dedicates most of its resources to a small fraction of the visual field (the fovea), which it moves frequently and rapidly to acquire a series of rich representations of small parts of a scene. We are developing an artificial system to approximate this aspect of human vision on a robot. The main components are a novel foveating lens, and a novel gimbal that can perform rapid and precise stereo camera orientation. This paper focuses on the gimbal design, which we are releasing under an open hardware license. We expect that it will serve as both an advanced robot vision system, and a source of further insight into human vision.

The advanced control strategies when applied into BLDC motor drive systems may further enhance their performance. However, these methods are relatively complex and computationally intensive, which may hamper the implementation. Fuzzy logic control algorithm has been developed in this investigation and embedded into a commercially available motion control system for the position control of BLDC motors. BLDC motor drives offered by PicoMotion Inc. and Motion Control Framework software platform have been selected for the experiments due to their compactness, flexibility and the open hardware and software concept they have been created upon. The obtained comparative results with respect to the built in PI control law have confirmed that the implementation of more advanced control strategies on inexpensive hardware and software platforms, nowadays available on the market for the control of BLDC motors, can be practically feasible and can enhance their performance.

The current technology is inaccessible to smaller community groups, citizen scientists, teachers, and even university researchers needing to collect real time or high density data. The HydroSense project aims to build an open-source hardware and software framework to enable hydroclimatic monitoring in a more cost effective manner. At present, several prototype system components have been designed, fabricated, and tested. Our design demonstrates that a complete hydroclimatic monitoring system can be deployed at 1/8th the cost of modern commercially available systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability to interface with existing water quality sensors, allowing stakeholders the ability to use instruments they may already own.

This paper describes the development of new models for underwater haptic actuation and the ongoing prototype development process necessary for creating this tool. Our objective is to create a system that detects underwater topographies to assist the location of sunken objects in flooded areas by sending haptic signals to wearer's fingertips produced by micro-pumps that propel water of varying pressures. This feedback system extends current haptic technologies by providing hybrid actuation including pressure and vibration underwater, while preserving the wearer's natural ability to grasp objects. This technology has many potential applications beyond underwater echo-haptic location, such as new interfaces for virtual reality object simulation in aqueous environments.

The ECG signal is composed by different waveforms: P, Q, R, S and T. The R wave is normally the easiest waveform to identify on the ECG. The R wave is also the component with the highest amplitude and its detection allows the estimation of the heart rate. This paper is devoted to present the design of a digital filter implemented on an open hardware platform called Arduino to detect the R wave of the ECG signal. The filter design is based on the integration of a smooth filter and the first order derivative. The implemented digital filter has been tested using different ECG signals generated by a patient simulator. Finally, this paper shows a positive performance of the implemented filter in tests related to R wave detection even in the presence of unwanted noise components.

The implemented system has three major components: A Glove and Sensor Unit (GSU) - consisting of a pair of gloves embedded with custom made, low-cost flex and contact sensors, a Primary Supporting Hardware (PSH) that maps change in input values from GSU, a Secondary Supporting Hardware (SSH) that processes the input values and recognizes the gesture accurately. When a gesture is signed, the GSU tracks the change in orientation of the fingers, which results in a change in voltage levels of the sensors. This change is mapped by the PSH and passed on to SSH which comprises of two ATmega328P microcontrollers, one connected to each of the glove. The two microcontrollers are connected in a master-slave configuration and communication between them is facilitated through an XBee module. The performance of this gesture recognition system is evaluated using a data set comprising of 36 unique gestures. These gestures represent a total of 120 gestures that include all gestures across five globally used sign languages. A gesture recognition engine that resides in the master microcontroller processes the input and identifies the gesture. The gesture recognition engine comprises of a two stage selection-elimination embedded intelligence algorithm that is used to enhance the system efficiency from 83.1% to 94.5% without any additional hardware. The cost of the system is USD 30, which the authors believe on commercialization, could be brought under USD 9.

If implemented on hardware these techniques provide more accuracy, faster response in real time predictions than any software implementation. Existing hardware implementations are not at all cost effective, and require specific knowledge of hardware platform. In this paper a cost effective implementation of a statistical classifier has been proposed on Raspberry Pi, an open source hardware platform. This proposed implementation provides on board training of the classifier and real time class prediction. Moreover, it does not require knowledge about the hardware platform to classify the data.

Automated regulation of pressure or flux through a membrane is required to minimize membrane fouling, thus maximizing efficiency and lifespan. Myriad automation tools exist, ranging from single purpose-built solutions to numerous linked sensors and hardware controls, all analyzed and controlled though commercially-available proprietary hardware and software. This paper outlines a way to design control systems for membrane-based filtration that utilize open source hardware and software, increasing the flexibility of a system to changing performance requirements while simultaneously minimizing the expense in time and resources to implement the control scheme. The method presented here can reduce the capital requirement for system control by one to two orders of magnitude while enhancing flexibility for system expansion and process sharing.

While many others have created schemes for remote operation of equipment, many tend to either be customized to a target hardware, lack the requisite security protocols, or not be scalable. We have created such an architecture, leveraging existing commercial or open source hardware and software, and creating customizations where necessary to integrate the parts into an entire system. The result is an experience that connects students with industrially relevant hardware and software in a manner that approximates an industrial operator involved in remotely troubleshooting or configuring a networked remote resource.

Environmental downtime is a significant cost to organizations and makes them unable to do business because what happens in the data center affects everyone. In addition, the amount of electrical energy consumed by data center increases with the amount of computing power installed. One strategy of reducing energy consumption in data centers is to adjust the temperature and humidity data. Installation of physical Information Technology and facilities related to environment on monitoring temperature, humidity, power, flood, smoke, air flow, room entry is the most proactive way to reduce the unnecessary costs of expensive hardware replacement or unplanned downtime and decrease energy consumed by servers. In this paper, we present remote system for monitoring auxiliary data centers implemented using open-source hardware platforms, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and the Gobetwino. The objective of collecting temperature and humidity data allows monitoring server's health and gets alerts if things start to go wrong. When the temperature hits 50 degrees C., the supervisor at remote headquarters would get a SMS, then take appropriate actions that make sense to reduce electrical costs and preserve functionality of servers in auxiliary data centers. The data center environmental monitoring represents a step forward towards addressing awareness monitoring of energy efficiency and data centers located far with ability to receive a notification by email.

The Do-It-Yourself Assistive Technology (DIY-AT) approach investigates methodologies and tools to support accessible making practices. In prior work, we successfully used a DIY-AT approach to develop TalkBox, an open-source direct-selection communication board for those with little or no functional verbal communication. In this paper, we describe a follow-up project in which we use TalkBox as a prototyping platform to facilitate co-design and co-fabrication of DIY-AT. We present results from (1) a workshop in which users with disabilities and their parents/caregivers fabricated their own TalkBoxes, and (2) a collaborative co-design session with a nonverbal child and his mother wherein the potential for TalkBox variants led to novel design decisions. We illustrate the outcome of our process by describing the multi-vocabulary variant called Hot Swappable TalkBox, in which RFID technology is used to afford easy switching among different vocabulary sets.

BCI based on non-invasive neuroimaging techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG) have many applications, however the dissemination of the technology is limited, in part because of the price of the hardware. In this paper we compare side by side two EEG amplifiers, the consumer grade OpenBCI and the medical grade g. tec g. USBamp. For this purpose, we employed an original montage, based on the simultaneous recording of the same set of electrodes. Two set of recordings were performed. During the first experiment a simple adapter with a direct connection between the amplifiers and the electrodes was used. Then, in a second experiment, we attempted to discard any possible interference that one amplifier could cause to the other by adding "ideal" diodes to the adapter. Both spectral and temporal features were tested - the former with a workload monitoring task, the latter with an visual P300 speller task. Overall, the results suggest that the OpenBCI board - or a similar solution based on the Texas Instrument ADS1299 chip - could be an effective alternative to traditional EEG devices. Even though a medical grade equipment still outperforms the OpenBCI, the latter gives very close EEG readings, resulting in practice in a classification accuracy that may be suitable for popularizing BCI uses.

In this paper we present the design and the initial development of a new security-oriented open hardware and software platform easy to be integrated and capable of hiding significant complexity behind a set of simple high-level APIs. This SoC platform is called SEcube (TM) (Secure Environment cube). It is a single-chip design that embeds three main cores: a highly powerful processor, a Common Criteria certified smartcard, and a flexible FPGA. The SEcube (TM) platform provides several functional entry levels, ranging from the hardware to software APIs amenable to become service-ready in a near future. This way, developers who do not feel comfortable on security aspects can use the easy-to-use API abstraction layer and experience the Cube as a high-security black box. Conversely, security experts can avail of the open source character, and verify, change, or write from scratch the entire system, starting from the elementary low-level blocks.

In the networking community, innovative solutions are being developed for the Device Layer of the Internet of Things, which includes the IoT wireless protocols. In order to study their performance, researchers turn more often to real world platforms, commonly designated by the term "testbeds", on which they may implement and test the protocols and algorithms. This is even more important in the Industrial IoT field, where environments are perturbed by industrial systems like automated production systems. In this paper, after a brief presentation of the context of testbeds, we introduce WiNo and OpenWiNo, an open hardware and software framework for fast-prototyping in the field of the Internet of Things. Compared to existing platforms, the solution WiNo+OpenWiNo offers a wide array of Physical layers and easy integration of various sensors as it is developed as part of the Arduino ecosystem.

These necessary efforts are however constrained if the surrounding business model patterns are not challenged at the same time. In this article, open source design (OSD) is presented as a potential concept leading towards alternative and eco-efficient production and consumption patterns. Potential advantages of OSD for environmental sustainability are hypothesized and confronted with the analysis of the environmental friendliness of four open source products. Two synergies between sustainable design and OSD are identified (product modularity and design for local manufacturing) as well as corresponding challenges for further research.

The quantum bits are prepared in the polarization of weak optical pulses generated with light emitting diodes, and detected using a sole single-photon counter and a temporally multiplexed scheme. The system generates a shared cryptographic key at a rate of 365 bps, with a raw quantum bit error rate of 2.7%. A detailed description of the peripheral electronics for control, driving and communication between stages is released as supplementary material. The device can be built using simple and reliable hardware and it is presented as an alternative for a practical realization of sophisticated, yet accessible quantum key distribution systems.

In the RoboCup MSL, two teams of five autonomous robots play on an 18- x 12-m field. Equipped with sensors and on-board computers, each robot should be able to perceive the environment, make decision and control itself to play the soccer game autonomously. Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents the design of our soccer robots, participating in RoboCup MSL. The mechanical platform, electrical architecture and software framework are discussed separately. The mechanical platform is designed modularly, so easy maintainability is achieved; the electronic architecture is built on industrial standards using PC-based control technique, which results in high robustness and reliability during the intensive and fierce MSL games; the software is developed upon the open-source Robot Operating System (ROS); thus, the advantages of ROS such as modularity, portability and expansibility are inherited. Findings - Based on this paper and the open-source hardware and software, the MSL robots can be re-developed easily to participate in the RoboCup MSL. The robots can also be used in other research and education fields, especially for multi-robot systems and distributed artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the main designing ideas proposed in the paper, i.e. using a modular mechanical structure, an industrial electronic system and ROS-based software, provide a common solution for designing general intelligent robots. Originality/value - The methodology of the intelligent robot design for highly competitive and dynamic RoboCup MSL environments is proposed.

This program was developed in a senior class at the high school Liceo Paschini in Tolmezzo (northeast Italy). The students under the supervision of their physics teacher and seismologists, used an Arduino board, ADXL345 accelerometers, and open-source software to create a low-cost seismometer able to record local strong motion. In this article, we provide a "how-to" (instructional) guide to enable other students to reproduce the experiment. Certain introductory lessons in computer sciences and electronics were required for the students to acquire the necessary skills and to fill gaps in their background knowledge. In addition, lectures by seismologists and specific laboratory activities allowed the class to explore different aspects of the physics of earthquakes, particularly of the seismic waves, and to become familiar with seismic-hazard topics through inquiry-based learning. We believe that this exercise is a good example of how earthquake issues can be taught through a multidisciplinary approach in subjects traditionally covered by scientific and technological disciplines.

An Open and Modular Hardware Node for Wireless Sensor and Body Area Networks	JOURNAL OF SENSORS			English	Article							SIMULATION; DESIGN; SYSTEM	Health monitoring is nowadays one of the hottest markets due to the increasing interest in prevention and treatment of physical problems. In this context the development of wearable, wireless, open-source, and nonintrusive sensing solutions is still an open problem. Indeed, most of the existing commercial architectures are closed and provide little flexibility. In this paper, an open hardware architecture for designing a modular wireless sensor node for health monitoring is proposed. By separating the connection and sensing functions in two separate boards, compliant with the IEEE1451 standard, we add plug and play capabilities to analog transducers, while granting at the same time a high level of customization. As an additional contribution of the work, we developed a cosimulation tool which simplifies the physical connection with the hardware devices and provides support for complex systems. Finally, a wireless body area network for fall detection and health monitoring, based on wireless node prototypes realized according to the proposed architecture, is presented as an application scenario.

The frequently cited promises of modular robotics-versatility, robustness, and low cost-assume the availability of large numbers of modules. However, modules in most MR prototypes are large, mechanically complex, expensive, and difficult to manufacture. Soldercubes partially overcome this contradiction through optimizing some components for volume manufacturing processes. With the integration of a soldering connector which weighs only 2 g and has no moving parts, Soldercubes are among the cheapest, lightest and smallest among comparable self-reconfiguring MR systems. This paper describes the Soldercube module design in detail, reports on experiments in a lattice configuration, explores non-lattice applications of the system, and discusses the effects of utilising volume manufacturing processes in module production. All Soldercubes design files are released as open source hardware.

The objective has been to radiation harden existing Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) emergency luminaires to maximise lighting performance, without compromising IEC 60598-2-22 compliance. A systems level approach has been adopted, leading to the development of a diode bridge based AC/DC power converter. Modified COTS luminaires including this converter design have been irradiated (to 100 kGy TID using a Cobalt-60 source), with results of a subsequent photometric analysis presented. Following encouraging tests results, a reference design for the power converter has been released under the CERN Open Hardware License to encourage manufacturer adoption. The paper concludes with areas of interest for future research in further improving the radiation hardness of LED emergency lighting for accelerators with detailed studies at the component level for high power white LED devices and associated optical components.

The effect of using the quality-based scenarios is that it allows more rigorous treatment of non-functional requirements and hence proper selection of an architecture modeling to satisfy these requirements.

The most significant solution in that area are Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). These networks consist of a large number of small devices, each with different kinds of sensors. Sensor network nodes are arranged near or inside the potentially dangerous environment, which may cause the damage of the node. However, due to the small size and low cost nodes, these networks have a very broad application. The use of the WSN is dependent on the type of application used. Typical applications for this type of network can be: environmental monitoring, detection and tracking of people and vehicles, to detect various types of threats, machine monitoring or even health monitoring. The ability of the design and implement of the Wireless Sensor Networks is very important for today's engineers. The subject of the paper is issue related to the way of teaching Wireless Sensor Networks with the use of Arduino open source development board. The review of the learning path, which starts from the design and finishes on the implementation, was made. The advantages of the use of the open source hardware platform as also as open source software were determined. The way of design of Wireless Sensor Network using XBee protocol was explained.

One of the most successful example is the Robot Operating System (ROS), which aims at supporting robot development and research in robotics by providing a modular and general purpose software framework; yet, at a lower level, i.e., mechanics, electronics, and firmware, component-based robotics is still in its early stages. Moreover, basic functionalities, such as robust odometry and pose tracking, seem to be solved on an ad-hoc basis, while no generic solution can be plugged in a system as an off-the-shelf component. This paper presents two modular tools for the development of robotics applications and how these can be deployed on different robot platforms as off-the-shelf, open hardware and open software, components at the hardware, firmware, and core software levels. A case study based on two mobile platforms is described showing how it is possible to reuse physical components in the building of a mobile robot and provide an off-the-shelf architecture which sports multi-sensor fusion for robust odometry and pose tracking, requiring a fraction of the effort with respect to ad hoc techniques.

The robot has 13 DOFs: 4 DOFs with series elastic actuators in each arm, 3 DOFs for roll, pitch and yaw of the waist, and 2 DOFs for head pan and tilt. Our main innovation is in the employment of a polyurethane based compliant spring system attached to conventional robotics servo motors, turning them into low-cost series elastic actuators (SEAs). To demonstrate the robot's capabilities in the context of cognitive robotics research and goal-directed behavior, we successfully employed a multiple timescale recurrent neural network (MTRNN), enabling the robot to reproduce combined prototypical movement patterns previously trained via interactive demonstration.

J	West, J; Kuk, G				West, Joel; Kuk, George			The complementarity of openness: How MakerBot leveraged Thingiverse in 3Dprinting	TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE			English	Article						3D printing; Online communities; Open innovation; Open design; Complementary assets	OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE; OPEN INNOVATION; EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; COMMUNITY; FIRMS; KNOWLEDGE; USERS; ARCHITECTURE; PROPRIETARY; INFORMATION	Selective openness allows a firm to sell a systemic innovation that combines both open and proprietary technologies. Such firm strategies are now common for open source software and other information goods. However, they pose conceptual and practical uncertainties for hardware-focused companies, particularly as research on open hardware has emphasized community rather than firm success. Here we study firm openness in 3D printing, with a case study of how MakerBot Industries leveraged external communities and selective openness become the consumer market leader. After reviewing the literature on systemic innovation and selective openness, we document the proprietary strategies of a dozen startup companies during the first two decades of the 3D printing industry. We contrast this to the open hardware, software and content strategy that MakerBot's founders used to enter and grow the consumer market from 2009 onward. We show how MakerBot shifted to a selectively open, systemic innovation strategy that complemented proprietary hardware and software with open user-generated content from its Thingiverse online community. From this, we suggest the inherent complementarity of selective openness strategies between open and proprietary components, and conclude with predictions as to when and how a startup or incumbent firm will combine open and proprietary elements.

In situ formation of substrate release mechanisms for gas metal arc weld metal 3-D printing	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						3-D printing; Additive manufacturing; Aluminum; Steel; In situ formation; Distributed manufacturing; Gas metal arc weld; GMAW; Metal processing; Metal inert gas welding; MIG welding; Open-source; Open-source electronics; Open-source hardware; Personal fabrication; Rapid prototyping	RESIDUAL-STRESSES; FABRICATION; TECHNOLOGY; STEEL; MODEL	This study provides an in-depth investigation into low-cost and no-cost substrate release mechanisms that allow gas metal arc weld 3-D printed ER4043 aluminum and ER70S-6 steel parts to be removed from a reusable print substrate with minimal energy. Aluminum oxide, boron nitride, and titanium nitride coatings were evaluated as possible substrate release agents for aluminum printing. Additionally, the in situ formation of substrate release agents such as intermetallics and oxides were tested for both aluminum and steel printing. Testing was performed with a modified Charpy impact tester to remove 3D printed metal parts from an 1100 aluminum or A36 low carbon steel print substrate to assess the impact energy required for removal. Specimen porosity was measured prior to sectioning and microstructural analysis, hardness traverses were measured across the specimens, and the elastic and shear moduli of the parts were analyzed via ultrasonic methods. All of the employed substrate release mechanisms minimized weld penetration and, in some instances, formed a brittle phase with the print substrate that allowed the specimens to be removed with minimal impact energy. These results thus provide methods with the removal of metal 3-D printed parts from print substrates with no specialized tooling or equipment conducive to distributed manufacturing.

Integrated Voltage-Current Monitoring and Control of Gas Metal Arc Weld Magnetic Ball-Jointed Open Source 3-D Printer	MACHINES			English	Article						3-D printing; additive manufacturing; data logging; GMAW; metal printing; open-source hardware; quality control; RepRap; welder; welding	SUBSTRATE RELEASE MECHANISMS; DIGITAL FABRICATION; REPRAP; POLYMER	To provide process optimization of metal fabricating self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) 3-D printers requires a low-cost sensor and data logger system to measure current (I) and voltage (V) of the gas metal arc welders (GMAW). This paper builds on previous open-source hardware development to provide a real-time measurement of welder I-V where the measuring circuit is connected to two analog inputs of the Arduino that is used to control the 3-D printer itself. Franklin firmware accessed through a web interface that is used to control the printer allows storing the measured values and downloading those stored readings to the user's computer. To test this custom current and voltage monitoring device this study reports on its use on an upgraded all metal RepRap during the printing of aluminum alloy (ER1100, ER4043, ER4943, ER4047, and ER5356). The voltage and current data were analyzed on a per alloy basis and also layer-by-layer in order to evaluate the device's efficacy as a monitoring device for 3-D printing and the results of the integrated design are discussed.

The robot uses computer vision, a self-organizing map, and a learning program to automatically categorize the behavior of the droplet that it creates. The robot can then use this categorization to autonomously detect the current state of the droplet and respond. The robot is programmed to visually track the droplet and either inject more chemical fuel to sustain a motile state or introduce a new chemical component that results in a state change (e.g., division). Coupling inexpensive open source hardware with sensing and feedback allows for replicable real-time manipulation and monitoring of nonequilibrium systems that would be otherwise tedious, expensive, and error-prone. This system is a first step towards the practical confluence of chemical, artificial intelligence, and robotic approaches to artificial life.

Implementation of an electronic system to monitor the thermoregulatory capacity of honeybee colonies in hives with open-screened bottom boards	COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE			English	Article						Honey bee; Arduino; Temperature; Humidity; Monitoring; Precision beekeeping	HEAT-PRODUCTION; BEES; TEMPERATURE; HUMIDITY; WINTER; BROOD	Electronic systems are not widely used for measuring biological variables in beehives despite the importance that honeybees have for both the environment and humans. A better understanding of bee colonies is needed in order to prevent certain dangers that threaten the bee population. In this study, we have developed an electronic system based on the Arduino Open Hardware platform, to which we have added temperature and humidity sensors to adapt the system to the particular conditions of beehive management. The system has been used to record changes in temperature and humidity inside hives and assess bees' thermoregulation adaptability within colonies in hives with opened-screened bottom boards; an interesting management tool for controlling the harmful Varroa destructor mite as compared to beehives with conventional closed bottom boards. The results revealed that bee colonies were able to thermoregulate in hives with open anti-Varroa bottom boards to the same degree as those in conventional bottom board hives even under winter conditions in a mediterranean climate, thus indicating that there are no additional risks associated with the use of open-screened bottom board models.

Such a system provides for the use of an electric pump for the circulation of heat transfer fluid connecting the solar thermal panel to the storage tank. The running plant temperatures are the fundamental parameter to evaluate the system performance such as proper operation, and the control and management system has to consider these parameters. A solar energy-powered wireless-based smart object was developed, able to monitor the running temperatures of a solar thermal system and aimed at moving beyond standard monitoring approaches to achieve a low-cost and customizable device, even in terms of installation in different environmental conditions.

Here, the Bellwether Phenotyping Platform for controlled-environment plant growth and automated multimodal phenotyping is described. The system has capacity for 1140 plants, which pass daily through stations to record fluorescence, near-infrared, and visible images. Plant Computer Vision (PlantCV) was developed as open-source, hardware platform-independent software for quantitative image analysis. In a 4-week experiment, wild Setaria viridis and domesticated Setaria italica had fundamentally different temporal responses to water availability. While both lines produced similar levels of biomass under limited water conditions, Setaria viridis maintained the same water-use efficiency under water replete conditions, while Setaria italica shifted to less efficient growth. Overall, the Bellwether Phenotyping Platform and PlantCV software detected significant effects of genotype and environment on height, biomass, water-use efficiency, color, plant architecture, and tissue water status traits. All similar to 79 000 images acquired during the course of the experiment are publicly available.

A novel marine mesocosm facility to study global warming, water quality, and ocean acidification	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Experimental biology; flow-through system; marine mesocosm; open-source board control system; pCO(2) reactor; realism; stress physiology	CORAL COVER; REEF; PSEUDOREPLICATION; TOXICITY; DECLINE; COPPER	We describe a completely randomizable flow-through outdoor mesocosm for climate change and ecotoxicology studies that was built with inexpensive materials. The 16 raceway tanks allow up to 6x water renewal per hour, avoiding changes in natural abiotic seawater conditions. We use an open-source hardware board (Arduino) that was adapted to control heaters and an innovative CO2 injection system. This system reduced seawater pH up to -0.9 units and increased temperature up to +6 degrees C in three treatments and a control. Treatments can be continuously compared with the control and vary according to diel fluctuations, thus following the diel range observed in the sea. The mesocosm facility also includes an integrated secondary system of 48 aquaria for ecotoxicology studies. We validated the reproducibility and relevance of our experimental system by analyzing the variation of the total DNA of the microbial community extracted from corals in three elevated temperature scenarios during a 40-day experiment. We also present data from temperature, acidification, and copper contamination trials, which allowed continuous, reliable, and consistent treatment manipulations.

Three-dimensional printing of complex biological structures by freeform reversible embedding of suspended hydrogels	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article								We demonstrate the additive manufacturing of complex three-dimensional (3D) biological structures using soft protein and polysaccharide hydrogels that are challenging or impossible to create using traditional fabrication approaches. These structures are built by embedding the printed hydrogel within a secondary hydrogel that serves as a temporary, thermoreversible, and biocompatible support. This process, termed freeform reversible embedding of suspended hydrogels, enables 3D printing of hydrated materials with an elastic modulus <500 kPa including alginate, collagen, and fibrin. Computer-aided design models of 3D optical, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging data were 3D printed at a resolution of similar to 200 mm and at low cost by leveraging open-source hardware and software tools. Proof-of-concept structures based on femurs, branched coronary arteries, trabeculated embryonic hearts, and human brains were mechanically robust and recreated complex 3D internal and external anatomical architectures.

Open source hardware, which is the free exchange of a product's design information, is gaining popularity as well. Both ideologies are motivated by trading away competition against collaboration. In this paper we suggest the application of the open source movement to space technology. In the focus of our discussion are CubeSats, considered as an ideal playground for the introduction of technological and methodological novelties. We examine the legal background of open source designs and contrast the advantages of open source products for developers and users against closed source products. We then present an open source initiative for CubeSat technologies with the intention to encourage the CubeSat community to move towards open design. (C) 2015 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

These open designs-both hardware and software-empower students and the communities in which they live. They are free to shape the tools that they use to experiment and to engage in projects that are authentic in their design.

Open source hardware to monitor environmental parameters in precision agriculture	BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING			English	Article						Open source; Arduino; Environmental parameters	WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS; TEMPERATURE; DESIGN; HORTICULTURE	Precision agriculture combines the use of information and technology to ensure the best agricultural practices. Obtaining real-time non-invasive information to monitor crops or make yield predictions is a challenge. An approach is to use crop yield models in combination with real-time data used as input in such models. It was demonstrated that it is possible to design an accurate system using open source hardware and open systems to record the input for these models and monitor crops. The system presented has two main components: a device that records environmental parameters and a smartphone application (software) that links this device to a data server in order to process and analyse the information. The solution is scalable in terms of the type of sensors used (i.e. temperature and relative humidity of the air or soil), the rate of information retrieval and so on, so it can be used in various scenarios, including environmental or land policy monitoring. Moreover, this open source hardware can be used by a broad variety of users and is an alternative in poor rural areas because of its low cost compared to other solutions. It can enable increased agricultural production and management of the local environment, bringing new agricultural practices to these areas. Furthermore, progress in the use of this type of technology can help to develop new capabilities for growers. Results of calibration tests and measurements to demonstrate the usefulness of this system in precision agriculture are presented. (C) 2015 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Automatically generated embedded model predictive control: Moving an industrial PC-based MPC to an embedded platform	OPTIMAL CONTROL APPLICATIONS & METHODS			English	Article						embedded real-time model predictive control; linear model predictive control; automatic custom code generation		An embedded model predictive controller (eMPC) based on the linear MPC module in Statoil Estimation and Prediction Tool for Identification and Control has been developed, and it is intended to facilitate the MPC application on embedded hardware. The control design approach illustrates a viable way of migrating from an industrial PC-based MPC technology to an embedded platform. This work also provides the transformations and the real-time considerations necessary to achieve a functional high-performance predictive controller on a low-cost embedded hardware, with limited computational resources. The eMPC was implemented for rapid prototyping on the Ethernut 5 open-source hardware, and its performance was tested for a simulated process. The concept was tested using a real MPC application developed for a prototype of a new industrial process that requires an advanced embedded multivariable, constraint handling control solution. The results confirm the viability of the embedded MPC design approach. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	[Kufoalor, D. K. M.; Aaker, V.; Johansen, T.

J	Lindtner, S				Lindtner, Silvia			Hacking with Chinese Characteristics: The Promises of the Maker Movement against China's Manufacturing Culture	SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY & HUMAN VALUES			English	Article						other; expertise; labor; politics; power; governance		From the rising number of hackerspaces to an increase in hardware start-ups, maker culture is envisioned as an enabler of the next industrial revolutiona source of unhindered technological innovation, a revamp of broken economies and educational systems. Drawing from long-term ethnographic research, this article examines how China's makers demarcate Chinese manufacturing as a site of expertise in implementing this vision. China's makers demonstrate that the future of makingif to materialize in the ways currently envisioned by writers, politicians, and scholars of the global tech industryrests on taking seriously the technological and cultural fabrics of professional making outside familiar information technology innovation hubs like Silicon Valley: making-do, mass production, and reuse. I trace back to China's first hackerspace, documenting how a collective of makers began to move away from appropriating Western concepts of openness toward promoting China as source for knowledge, creativity, and innovation. This article demonstrates that when China's makers set up open hardware businesses and articulate a unique culture of hacking with Chinese characteristics, they draw boundaries between the professional making they saw embodied in Chinese industrial production and the hobbyist making embodied in Western histories and cultures of hacking.

Open-Source Photometric System for Enzymatic Nitrate Quantification	PLOS ONE			English	Article							OPEN-SOURCE HARDWARE; APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGY; NITROGEN-CYCLE; LOW-COST; POLYMER; DESIGN; EQUIPMENT; PLATFORM; ARDUINO; REPRAP	Nitrate, the most oxidized form of nitrogen, is regulated to protect people and animals from harmful levels as there is a large over abundance due to anthropogenic factors. Widespread field testing for nitrate could begin to address the nitrate pollution problem, however, the Cadmium Reduction Method, the leading certified method to detect and quantify nitrate, demands the use of a toxic heavy metal. An alternative, the recently proposed Environmental Protection Agency Nitrate Reductase Nitrate-Nitrogen Analysis Method, eliminates this problem but requires an expensive proprietary spectrophotometer. The development of an inexpensive portable, handheld photometer will greatly expedite field nitrate analysis to combat pollution. To accomplish this goal, a methodology for the design, development, and technical validation of an improved open-source water testing platform capable of performing Nitrate Reductase Nitrate-Nitrogen Analysis Method. This approach is evaluated for its potential to i) eliminate the need for toxic chemicals in water testing for nitrate and nitrite, ii) reduce the cost of equipment to perform this method for measurement for water quality, and iii) make the method easier to carryout in the field. The device is able to perform as well as commercial proprietary systems for less than 15% of the cost for materials. This allows for greater access to the technology and the new, safer nitrate testing technique.	[Wittbrodt, B. T.; Pearce, J.

The CloudThink infrastructure promotes the commoditization of vehicle telematics data by facilitating easier, flexible, and more secure access. It enables drivers to confidently share their vehicle information across multiple applications to improve the transportation experience for all stakeholders, as well as to potentially monetize their data. The foundations for an application ecosystem have been developed which, taken together with the fair value for driving data and low barriers to entry, will drive adoption of CloudThink as the standard method for projecting physical vehicles into the cloud. The application space initially consists of a few fundamental and important applications (vehicle tethering and remote diagnostics, road-safety monitoring, and fuel economy analysis) but as CloudThink begins to gain widespread adoption, the multiplexing of applications on the same data structure and set will accelerate its adoption.

X4-MaG is a small, low-cost open quadrotor of only 307-grammes which offers two levels of controllers providing a manual mode and an automatic mode thanks to powerful Linux-based controller embedded onboard. The experiments presented here show the reliability of the open hardware and software embedded onboard the quadrotor. To estimate the robot s attitude, a quaternion-based complementary filter requiring very few computational resources was developed and implemented on an 8-bit Arduino board. It was also established that the stabilization feedback system based on quaternions tracks the attitude setpoints with precision up to twice greater than a classical cascaded PI controller. The controllers and estimators were designed in the Matlab/Simulink environment and directly implemented onboard the tiny Linux-based autopilot board using a custom made toolbox (RT-MaG toolbox). The autopilot was tested in the brand-new Marseilles Flying Arena with various 3-D flight trajectories and found to be highly accurate with errors of only 0.7cm in hover and less than 3.2cm at 1.2m.s(-1). The X4-MaG quadrotor was able to reach speeds greater than 2m.s(-1) and reject attitude disturbances of 20' within 0.8s.

Open systems have a reputation for being difficult to acquire, poorly documented, and hard to maintain. With the arrival of more powerful and compact integrated circuits, rapid prototyping services, and web-based tools for collaborative development, these stereotypes must be reconsidered. We discuss some of the reasons why multichannel extracellular electrophysiology could benefit from open-source approaches and describe examples of successful community-driven tool development within this field. In order to promote the adoption of open-source hardware and to reduce the need for redundant development efforts, we advocate a move toward standardized interfaces that connect each element of the data processing pipeline. This will give researchers the flexibility to modify their tools when necessary, while allowing them to continue to benefit from the high-quality products and expertise provided by commercial vendors.

Power consumption monitoring in manufacturing companies can lead to a reduction of machine tools energy wastes and consequently to lower expenses. To this end, a complete transparency of energy usage among the entire manufacturing facilities is required. Despite the small volume of material processed, micro manufacturing processes are energy intensive and the optimization of energy usage becomes critical for manufacturing sustainability. Electrical discharge machining (EDM) is considered an attractive solution for the manufacturing of microcomponents. In this paper, a low cost and modular data acquisition system, based on open-hardware and open-source software, for online energy consumption monitoring, is presented. The system described is applied for energy efficiency analysis of the micro EDM milling process by using a state of the art commercial machine tool. A number of sensors is connected to the data acquisition system to measure the energy consumption of the main sub-systems of the machine tool, data is recorded through a microcontroller, and sent to the main computer via Wi-Fi for data storage and analysis. Results show that the process efficiency depends on machine parameters but it is always far below 0.01 %. Solutions are suggested to improve the energy efficiency of the machine tool considered in this work.

Open-source 3-D printing technologies for education: Bringing additive manufacturing to the classroom	JOURNAL OF VISUAL LANGUAGES AND COMPUTING			English	Article						3-D printing; Open-source hardware; STEM education; Transformative education; Teacher workshop; Teacher education	CONSERVATION CULTURE; SCHOOL; REPRAP	Objective: 3-D printing technologies have the potential to improve both Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education and Career and Technical Education (CTE), as well as integrating these two educational emphases and providing opportunities for cross-curriculum engagement. The objective of this study is to investigate the potential of open-source (OS) technologies in an educational setting, given the combination of economic constraints affecting all educational environments and the ability of OS design to profoundly decrease the cost of technological tools and technological innovation. Methods: This paper reports on a 3-day workshop augmented with online instructional and visual tools designed for middle school and high school level educators from a wide array of disciplines (including traditional science, math, and engineering as well as computer, shop, and art). Teachers (n=22) submitted applications to participate in the workshop, the workshop was observed for both evaluation and research, teachers participated in focus groups (n=2) during the workshop in order to discuss their interest in OS 3-D printing technology and its potential role in their classrooms, and teachers completed a voluntary post-workshop survey and responded to follow-up after printers were in the classroom for one year. Results: During the workshop teachers built 3-D printers using OS technologies that they were then able to take back to their schools and into their classrooms. Conclusion: Through workshops augmented with online instructional and visual tools designed to provide facilitated yet self-directed engagement with a new, relatively unknown, and relatively complex technology, paired teacher teams were able to successfully build and use RepRap 3-D printers based on OS design in just three days. Practice: Here, we discuss both what the teachers learned and what we learned from the teachers regarding the potential for educators to construct OS 3-D printing technologies as a tool of empowering and transformative education. Implications: Open-source 3-D printing technologies have the potential to improve education through a sense of empowerment resulting from active participation, as well as through cross-curriculum engagement.

It is a holistic concept, which considers several categories, each related to a specific environmental parameter. This article describes a low-cost and open-source hardware architecture able to detect the indoor variables necessary for the IEQ calculation as an alternative to the traditional hardware used for this purpose. The system consists of some sensors and an Arduino board. One of the key strengths of Arduino is the possibility it affords of loading the script into the board's memory and letting it run without interfacing with computers, thus granting complete independence, portability and accuracy. Recent works have demonstrated that the cost of scientific equipment can be reduced by applying open-source principles to their design using a combination of the Arduino platform and a 3D printer. The evolution of the 3D printer has provided a new means of open design capable of accelerating self-directed development. The proposed nano Environmental Monitoring System (nEMoS) instrument is shown to have good reliability and it provides the foundation for a more critical approach to the use of professional sensors as well as for conceiving new scenarios and potential applications.

Implementation of an Intelligent Computing Platform for Determination of Moisture Content of Subgrade Soil	GEOTECHNICAL TESTING JOURNAL			English	Article						subgrade soil; water content; soil compaction; soil stabilization; artificial neural network	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK	Determination of moisture content of soil is absolutely crucial and must be performed frequently to assure the quality of construction work. In a view to suppress the limitations and inaccuracies of the existing methods, a new concept is successfully implemented. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and state-of-the-art electronic circuitry are embedded to realize an automatic measurement system based on an open-source computing platform. Moreover, to facilitate user interaction with the system, a sophisticated graphical user interface (GUI) is created. This system, from both the hardware and software perspective, brings new ideas in, not only the moisture content determination test, but in geotechnical engineering laboratory and field instrumentation in terms of accuracy, automation, and machine intelligence. It will be obvious from this work that open-source hardware and software embedded in test equipment can automate the whole test procedure for almost all types of tests in geotechnical engineering using appropriate sensor, and data-acquisition and processing routines. This paper presents the technical know-how of the system setup, hardware, and software development, workflow, and system validation for the determination of moisture content of subgrade soil in two distinct test modes-supervised and unsupervised. This work will demonstrate that, not only the test procedure can be automated, but time optimization is also possible, which results in at least 50 % test time reduction.

One of its key components is the printer nozzle. The performance and reliability deficiencies of currently available nozzle designs are common topics in the RepRap community, and our own experience with a RepRap 3D printer has identified a need for improvement in a few particular areas. We set out to eliminate melt leakage, improve thermal isolation, and develop a more effective method of nozzle assembly attachment. Here, we review the issues, describe design efforts, and report results.

The fundamental workings of the detector-the interferometer-are easily explained in undergraduate physics courses, but practical implementations are dominated by specialized, and commercial, devices. We present a robust and relatively inexpensive detector, which consists of a heterodyne interferometer and phase locked loop frequency demodulator, as an open-source alternative. We illustrate the broadband capabilities with the detection of ultrasonic waves in a mudstone sample, and low-frequency (100 Hz) vibrations of a piston.

Closed-loop DBS with real-time feedback is gaining attention in recent years, after proved more effective than conventional DBS in terms of pathological symptom control clinically. Here we demonstrate the conceptualization and validation of a closed-loop DBS system using open-source hardware. We used hippocampal theta oscillations as system input, and electrical stimulation in the mesencephalic reticular formation (mRt) as controller output. It is well documented that hippocampal theta oscillations are highly related to locomotion, while electrical stimulation in the mRt induces freezing. We used an Arduino open-source microcontroller between input and output sources. This allowed us to use hippocampal local field potentials (LFPs) to steer electrical stimulation in the mRt. Our results showed that closed-loop DBS significantly suppressed locomotion compared to no stimulation, and required on average only 56% of the stimulation used in open-loop DBS to reach similar effects. The main advantages of open-source hardware include wide selection and availability, high customizability, and affordability. Our open-source closed-loop DBS system is effective, and warrants further research using open-source hardware for closed-loop neuromodulation.

Open culture and innovation: integrating knowledge across boundaries	MEDIA CULTURE & SOCIETY			English	Article						hacking culture; innovation; licenses; open hardware; open knowledge; research		What does open source mean for culture? For knowledge? As cultural production has come to be characterized by contribution as well as consumption and as alternative modes of intellectual property transfer challenge the dominant paradigm' that knowledge and information should be protected and monetized, the logic of open sourcing' has extended into many cultural spheres. This article positions openness' as a value that intermediates between re-usable software code, institutional transparency, and expanded opportunities for participation in knowledge production cultures. By observing and analyzing the expansion of openness' from computer software to electronics hardware, we can develop a framework that identifies the tensions between socio-cultural visions of knowledge commons and the realities of governing those commons. This research focuses in particular on the knowledge related to electronics hardware and other material objects governed by open hardware licenses. The insights in this article are valuable for anyone studying open source and peer production processes and the knowledge claims surrounding them.

JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH			English	Editorial Material						governmental regulations; health services; medical devices; mHealth; mobile phones; open source initiative; software; standards; technology	SMARTPHONE APPLICATIONS; MANAGEMENT	Technology is changing at a rapid rate, opening up new possibilities within the health care domain. Advances such as open source hardware, personal medical devices, and mobile phone apps are creating opportunities for custom-made medical devices and personalized care. However, they also introduce new challenges in balancing the need for regulation (ensuring safety and performance) with the need to innovate flexibly and efficiently. Compared with the emergence of new technologies, health technology design standards and regulations evolve slowly, and therefore, it can be difficult to apply these standards to the latest developments. For example, current regulations may not be suitable for approaches involving open source hardware, an increasingly popular way to create medical devices in the maker community. Medical device standards may not be flexible enough when evaluating the usability of mobile medical devices that can be used in a multitude of different ways, outside of clinical settings. Similarly, while regulatory guidance has been updated to address the proliferation of health-related mobile phone apps, it can be hard to know if and when these regulations apply. In this viewpoint, we present three examples of novel medical technologies to illustrate the types of regulatory issues that arise in the current environment. We also suggest opportunities for support, such as advances in the way we review and monitor medical technologies.

Some authors have described the innovation process as Engineering Innovation. Currently the software is no longer a technology support, hidden and invisible, to become the driver of value-creating process. Consequently, the challenge of software engineering and engineering innovation should be integrated and complement in order creates new ways to create value. To encourage innovation, in addition to understanding tools and practices of the innovation process, the innovation skills are required. These skills can be grouped into: technical, creativity, collaboration, critical thinking, and management. This paper proposes a strategy based on the use of open source hardware and software to address the development of skills to innovate. The strategy is presented by narrating academic experiences.

The drive towards smart cities has produced the need for smart sensors to be able to monitor what is happening in our cities. This, combined with the decrease in hardware component prices and the increase in the popularity of open hardware, has favored the deployment of sensor networks based on open hardware. The new trends in Internet Protocol (IP) communication between sensor nodes allow sensor access via the Internet, turning them into smart objects (Internet of Things and Web of Things). Currently, WSNs provide data in different formats. There is a lack of communication protocol standardization, which turns into interoperability issues when connecting different sensor networks or even when connecting different sensor nodes within the same network. This work presents a sensorized platform proposal that adheres to the principles of the Internet of Things and the Web of Things. Wireless sensor nodes were built using open hardware solutions, and communications rely on the HTTP/IP Internet protocols. The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) SensorThings API candidate standard was used as a neutral format to avoid interoperability issues. An environmental WSN developed following the proposed architecture was built as a proof of concept. Details on how to build each node and a study regarding energy concerns are presented.

SENSORS			English	Article						Internet of Things; industrial networks; machine to machine; smart grid; wireless sensor network	SMART; INTERNET; STANDARD	The concept of the Internet of Things is rapidly becoming a reality, with many applications being deployed within industrial and consumer sectors. At the thing' leveldevices and inter-device network communicationthe core technical building blocks are generally the same as those found in wireless sensor network implementations. For the Internet of Things to continue growing, we need more plentiful resources for building intelligent devices and sensor networks. Unfortunately, current commercial devices, e.g., sensor nodes and network gateways, tend to be expensive and proprietary, which presents a barrier to entry and arguably slows down further development. There are, however, an increasing number of open embedded platforms available and also a wide selection of off-the-shelf components that can quickly and easily be built into device and network gateway solutions. The question is whether these solutions measure up to built-for-purpose devices. In the paper, we provide a comparison of existing built-for-purpose devices against open source devices. For comparison, we have also designed and rapidly prototyped a sensor node based on off-the-shelf components. We show that these devices compare favorably to built-for-purpose devices in terms of performance, power and cost. Using open platforms and off-the-shelf components would allow more developers to build intelligent devices and sensor networks, which could result in a better overall development ecosystem, lower barriers to entry and rapid growth in the number of IoT applications.

The project involves several technological innovations, including portability, high-definition video recording, and multiplatform software support. It was designed for challenging recording environments, and all processing is done offline to allow for optimization of parameter estimation. The pupil and corneal reflection are estimated using a novel forward eye model that simultaneously fits both the pupil and the corneal reflection with full ellipses, addressing a common situation in which the corneal reflection sits at the edge of the pupil and therefore breaks the contour of the ellipse. The accuracy and precision of the system are comparable to or better than what is available in commercial eyetracking systems, with a typical accuracy of less than 0.4A degrees and best accuracy below 0.3A degrees, and with a typical precision (SD method) around 0.3A degrees and best precision below 0.2A degrees. Part of the success of the system comes from a high-resolution eye image. The high image quality results from uncasing common digital camcorders and recording directly to SD cards, which avoids the limitations of the analog NTSC format. The software is freely downloadable, and complete hardware plans are available, along with sources for custom parts.

Geared motors for hobby robotics are controlled by an Arduino microcontroller in combination with an H bridge to finely position mirror mount actuators. We present a graphical user interface based on the Python script language. The price of the fully controlled actuator system is only a small fraction of the price of a commercial system. It can be quickly implemented due to the use of open-hardware electronics. We discuss the performance of the system and give an outlook for future expansions and use in advanced optical setups.

Involving from one side concept of social situatedness and connectedness, and from another the concept of independent, self-directed and self-regulated student learning, the project was based on assembling the mini-lab, Radiation Sensor Board for Arduino, that was originally designed to help people in Japan to measure levels of radiation in their everyday life after the Fukushima accident. As it was reported elsewhere, this product was an example of crowdsourcing. When Libelien designed the Radiation Sensor Board for Waspmote, the idea was simple: with the Arduino platform people will be able to have easily running their own detector at home while on the other hand with Waspmote platform authorities will be able to deploy autonomous sensor networks to send the radiation levels from dangerous areas using wireless sensor platform ZigBee and GPRS technologies. This paper present students developing project where the Sensor Board for Arduino was used as assembling, teaching tool. The Do-It-Yourself and Internet of Things can be used both in educational, and in the research and development purposes. Owning their own mini-lab at their disposal anytime, students worked at their learning speed. It also boosted the interest, confidence of students and highly affected three domains of learning: cognitive domain (activities like instrumentation, modeling, experimentation, data analysis and design, psychomotor domain (activities like manipulating the apparatus, sensory awareness) and affective domain (behavior and attitudes to learn from failure, creativity, collaborative communication, safety and ethics in the laboratory). We show that networking learning, supported by hands-on labs on chip, and an open source electronics prototyping platform as Arduino and Raspberry Pi, give great opportunities for teaching and learning the tinkering and inventing skills, an request we have to deal with it at the University of Montenegro. Such project support exploratory and serendipitous learning. It moved teching from an emphasis simply on linear logic and programmed instruction, towards non-linear, networked, branching, hypertext views of learning, in which connections between knowledge are made and developed. It is based on principle of situated cognition and Vigotskian thought: situatedness, commonality, interdependency and infrastructure where learning is fascinated by an activity. The presented project integrate a Virtual Learning Environment, networking knowledge and student-owned movable laboratory on the chip, where radiation was used as a topic and where electronics was embedded and embodied.

This payload will contain several novel technologies that work together to demonstrate methodologies for space sample return missions and for nanosatellite communications in general. The payload will deploy and test an Exo-Brake, which slows the payload aerodynamically, providing eventual de-orbit and recovery of future ISS samples through a Small Payload Quick Return project. In addition, this flight addresses future Mars mission entry technology, space-to-space communications using the Iridium Short Messaging Service (SMS), GPS tracking, and wireless sensors using the ZigBee protocol. SOAREX-8 is being assembled and tested at Ames Research Center (ARC) and the NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC) is funding sensor and communications work. Open source Arduino technology and software are used for system control. The ZigBee modules used are XBee units that connect analog sensors for temperature, air pressure and acceleration measurement wirelessly to the payload telemetry system. Our team is developing methods for power distribution and module mounting, along with software for sensor integration, data assembly and downlink. We have demonstrated relaying telemetry to the ground using the Iridium satellite constellation on a previous flight, but the upcoming flight will be the first time we integrate useful flight test data from a ZigBee wireless sensor network. Wireless sensor data will measure the aerodynamic efficacy of the Exo-Brake permitting further on-orbit flight tests of improved designs. The Exo-Brake is 5 m(2) in area and will be stored in a container and deployed during ascent once the payload is jettisoned from the launch vehicle. We intend to further refine the hardware and continue testing on balloon launches, future sounding rocket flights and on nanosatellite missions. The use of standards-based and open-source hardware/software has allowed for this project to be completed with a very modest budget and a challenging schedule. There is a wealth of hardware and software available for both the Arduino platform and the XBee, all low-cost or open-source. Along with the Exo-Brake hardware and deployment discussion, this paper will describe in detail the system architecture emphasizing the successful use of open-source hardware and software to minimize effort and cost. Testing procedures, radio frequency interference (RFI) mitigation, success criteria and expected results will also be discussed. The use of Iridium short messaging capability for space-to-space links, standards-based wireless sensor networks, and other innovative communications technology are also presented.

Akin to software configuration management, it is becoming commonplace to maintain large hardware design code-bases with hardware configuration management tools. A missing piece of crucial technology in this approach is to manage design verification across evolving hardware designs. In this paper, we propose an efficient methodology for automatically localizing design errors across design versions. The proposed technique, EvoDeb, can be easily integrated into a hardware configuration management framework and is scalable for large designs. We demonstrate the efficacy of EvoDeb on a couple of bugs on open-source hardware designs across multiple evolving variants.

The advantages of this system include its flexibility, its modular structure facilitating concurrent development and its robustness, with easy evolution of existing systems. An application case study that highlights the potential of this model is detailed. Low cost modules have been chosen. As they are largely utilized they have a large community of developers and plenty related technical information can be found. They are based on free hardware and operating systems widely available. Modularity allows implementing them on existing systems, allowing easy evolution. Another significant advantage of the proposed model for both research and teaching is that, due to its low cost, it allows building more mobile robots.

New applications for wearable robots are encouraged by the lightness and portability of new devices and the progress in human-robot cooperation strategies. In this paper, we propose the different design guidelines to realize a robotic extra-finger for human grasping enhancement. Such guidelines were followed for the realization of three prototypes obtained using rapid prototyping techniques, i.e., a 3D printer and an open hardware development platform. Both fully actuated and under-actuated solutions have been explored. In the proposed wearable design, the robotic extra-finger can be worn as a bracelet in its rest position. The availability of a supplementary finger in the human hand allows to enlarge its workspace, improving grasping and manipulation capabilities. This preliminary work is a first step towards the development of robotic extra-limbs able to increase human workspace and dexterity.

Today there are truly uncountable different possible hardware/software low cost choices available for University teaching which could be complementary or alternative to the commonly used teaching tools (LabVIEW (R), MATLAB (R), etc.). In effects, the use of open-source and open-hardware platforms can offer different advantages with respect to traditional ones; first, they assure a bottom-up approach, which guarantees a pleasant and constructive learning with a gradual comprehension of concepts from the simple ones to more complex ones. Then, these cheap and readily available platforms permit to verify (also at home) the theoretical concepts and the proposed exercises with low cost devices rather than with expensive ones. Finally, the learning outcomes of the basic courses are indispensable to advanced courses where sensors, wireless networking and embedded systems converge, encouraging students to explore and realize new applications, preparing them for successful careers as engineers.

These systems, if properly structured and configured, can significantly increase the smartness of the environments where they are deployed, monitoring and continuously collecting data to be processed and elaborated. Such operations can be correctly executed, especially in large locations, if several embedded systems nodes are deployed under the design of an intelligent network. This paper presents SMuNe, a Smart Multisensor Network based on the BeableBone Black platform, a complete open hardware and software embedded computer; the challenge is to create a multi-purpose hierarchical network composed by smart nodes able to gain and manage heterogeneous data and spaces according to the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. As a proof of the effectiveness of SMuNe we conducted an experimentation within the Cultural Heritage domain; in detail we deployed SMuNe within a sculptures exhibition named "The Beauty or the Truth" in the monumental site of San Domenico Maggiore in Naples, Italy.

B	Weinert, A; Hu, H; Spensky, C; Bullough, B			IEEE	Weinert, Andrew; Hu, Hongyi; Spensky, Chad; Bullough, Benjamin			Using Open-source Hardware to Support Disadvantaged Communications	PROCEEDINGS OF THE FIFTH IEEE GLOBAL HUMANITARIAN TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE GHTC 2015			English	Proceedings Paper	Proceedings of the Fifth IEEE Global Humanitarian Technology Conference GHTC 2015	OCT 08-11, 2015	Seattle, WA	IEEE Reg 6, IEEE Seattle Sect, IEEE Advancing Technology Humanity				During a disaster, conventional communications infrastructures are often compromised, which prevents local populations from contacting family, friends, and colleagues. The lack of communication also impedes responder efforts to gather, organize, and disseminate information. This problem is made worse by the unique cost and operational constraints typically associated with the humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) space. In response, we present a low-cost, scalable system that creates a wide-area, best-effort, ad-hoc wireless network for emergency information. The Communication Assistance Technology over Ad-Hoc Networks (CATAN) system embraces the maker and do it yourself (DIY) communities by leveraging open-source and hobbyist technologies to create cheap, lightweight, battery powered nodes that can be deployed quickly for a variety of operations. CATAN enables geographically separated users to share information on standard interfaces, i.e. web and SMS, over commonly-used communication interfaces, i.e. GSM and Wi-Fi. These interfaces enable CATAN to accommodate a variety of digital devices while leveraging the global ubiquity of cellular devices. By emphasizing simple, mature, technologies, CATAN avoids many problems that hinder many general purpose ad-hoc technologies. We have tested our infrastructure in a variety of environments and have open-sourced the entire project to encourage collaboration with the greater HADR community.

However, there is still a lack of cost effective hardware and software solutions that would allow these consumers to monitor their installation, comprehend their electrical energy consumption, take action towards achieving energy efficiency, and effectively participate in Demand Response programs. This paper aims to address this issue, presenting a complete, open source hardware and software solution, which enables measurements of electrical voltages and currents at the installation main distribution panel, the transmission and storage of the respective data in a personal computer, and their subsequent processing by the Cassandra open source software platform. The analysis of the proposed solution components is followed by results obtained by the implementation in a residential installation.	[Andreou, G. T.; Chatzigeorgiou, I.

The required precision is application dependent; however, the possibility of sub 1 microsecond precision provided by low-cost advanced IEEE 1588 implementations sets the industry standard today. The performance and price of IEEE 1588 implementations are primarily defined by the master clocks and their actual installation and configuration. The paper investigate how master clock architectures, i.e., how the master clock is connected to the reference clock, influence price and performance; and in addition, it also details how the architecture effects installation and configuration requirements. The primary factors of investigation are ambient temperature and delay compensation required due to signal transmission time. The paper also introduces the architecture and performance of a Linux based open source/hardware prototype master clock developed by the author.

While many "National Engineers Week" programs exist for primary and middle school students, there is a lack of hands on activities for students in the 9th-12th grades. It is often difficult to devise experiments for this age group that are interesting and not juvenile. Yet, it is during these crucial years that most students are lost to science, math and engineering. Engaging students and presenting opportunities for invention and excitement is important in the teen years, when peer pressure and the distractions of friends, social events, and activities are particularly high.(1). There are a number of open source programming and affordable hardware platforms that can be used to implement low cost and interactive programs to promote innovation with various age groups. In this paper we share our work, as well as our learnings on how to make the workshops more effective. We have created various Arduino projects that can be customized to grade levels ranging from grades 7-12, and even college undergraduate students. The various projects we describe in this paper have been used to interact with students of different grade levels to engage in basic elements of engineering and computer programming. The classes should be set up to work in groups to promote shared innovation, teamwork and collaboration with peers. The open source and hardware experimenting exposed the students to various career paths ranging from software engineer, to electronic engineers and basic elements of various other engineering paths. This paper is designed to demonstrate the promotion of the engineering profession in schools through the use of Arduino Uno, Raspberry Pi Gemma kits, and Flora kits. The programs are also designed to accommodate classroom setting, workshops, or as an in-class field trip.

In many scenarios an integrated approach is required considering a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles. In this paper we focus on the development of a low-cost unmanned surface platform for digital surveys. The boat has been designed to navigate also in shallow water owing to a low draft design. An embedded system with Robot Operating System (ROS) onboard has been deployed on the surface vehicle. One of the main advantages of the proposed solution is its reduced cost owing to open-hardware/software solutions. In particular, an open-hardware solution is responsible for the interfacing of an RTK GPS with a bathymetric ultrasound sensor to map the sea/lake / river floor. The boat can be either remotely controllable or fully autonomous. An Augmented Reality (AR) application has been also developed to show the path and the set of survey blocks that are mapped/not mapped. The AR application is particularly useful when the user remotely controls the boat, but also for supervising the autonomous survey. The performances achieved in the first trials are satisfactory and the AR application produces significant maps.

In this paper, we describe a wireless sensor network system that we have developed using open-source hardware platforms, Raspberry Pi and zigbee. The system is low-cost, low power consuming and highly scalable both in terms of the type of sensors and the number of sensor nodes, which makes it well suited for a wide variety of applications related to environmental monitoring. Raspberry Pi is cheap, flexible, fully customizable and programmable small computer embedded linux board and abilities of its usage as WSN node and sensor node. Raspberry Pi works as a base station which connects the sensor nodes via zigbee protocol in the wireless sensor network and collects sensors data from different sensors, and supply multi-clients services including data display. The client can visit the base station remotely via (website) Ethernet or command console.

Many people have gardens in their homes. Maintenance of these gardens is tedious and time consuming task. The main aim is to implement a cost effective automated gardening system. This system helps in solving the above problem by being efficient and using fewer resources. The system uses low cost efficient soil moisture, light and temperature sensors to decide when and how much water will be provided to the potted plants. Programming languages like embedded C and python is used to configure the microcontroller. The data would be displayed through a GUI created using processing. The user will also be able to control the entire system remotely as well as monitor the sensor readings.	[Tripathy, A. K.; Vichare, A.; Pereira, R. R.; Pereira, V. D.; Rodrigues, J.

This is due to the ability to deposit a small amount of material in precisely defined position. In the field of Biofabrication, inkjet printers are used to build 2D and 3D scaffolds and gels with biological molecules, including living cells. Several works, including seminal papers on inkjet bioprinting, were carried out with modified office printers. These printers have fixed structural characteristics and operating size, especially on the print-head, limiting the range of materials that can be dispensed. The aim of the present work is the design and fabrication of an open-source piezoelectric inkjet print-head, optimized for the bioprinting field. This low-cost, reproducible, reliable, versatile and biocompatible device will enable various research laboratories to work with a shared device; the open source allowing for parts to be modified to suit specific needs. The design was carried out by Finite Element (FE) modelling of the piezoelectric, mechanical, fluid dynamics and their coupling. The design was optimized for shear rate, which we minimized in order to be able to print cells. The mechanical frame of the printer was designed and built using a low-cost 3D printer. The nozzle plate was fabricated from a polycarbonate disc coated with biocompatible silicone, to increase the hydrophobicity of the outer surface of the disc, preventing ink adhesion on the edge of the nozzle; the refilling system, and the electronic control were also part of the project and will be freely available to download. The FE models were validated with ad-hoc experiments, printing water, gelatin solution, and cell culture media, by modulating the wave power in amplitude, frequency and duty cycle. The tests showed a large working window both respect to viscosity and to surface tension. Finally Human Skin Fibroblasts (ATCC-CRL-2522, Teddington UK), suspended in culture media, were printed. Cell viability, assessed by CellTiter-Blue and LIVE / DEAD tests, resulted comparable with the control, demonstrating the validity of the first open source piezoelectric inkjet print-head for biofabrication.

A vertebrate's behaviors like focusing attention, cautious risk-aversion and curiosity seeking exploration are influenced by these neuromodulatory. The paper presents an autonomous robotic control approach based on vertebrate neuromodulation and its implementation on multiple open-source hardware platforms. A simple neural network is used to model the neuromodulatory functions for generating context based behavioral responses to sensory signals. The neural network incorporates three types of neurons- attention focusing cholinergic and noradrenergic (ACh/NE), curiosity-seeking dopaminergic (DA), and risk aversive serotonergic (5-HT) neurons. The implementation of the neuronal model on multiple relatively simple autonomous robots is illustrated through the interesting behavior of the robots adapting to changes in the environment. The implementation is done in open-source, open-access robotics software framework of Robot Operating System (ROS).

Instead, we are in a new age where technologies are developed by a networked community of actors and organizations, which base their relations dynamically to each other on a common interest. Such dynamic and networked complexity of technology development is often theoretical explored around the concept of platform, and more recently by employing the concept of ecosystem in an analogy to natural ecosystems. Following the success of open-source software, academics have long been examining openness in digital platforms/ecosystems; however most contributions take the perspective of a single stakeholder from the many that constitute a digital platform/ecosystem. Predominantly, they take the sole perspective of platform providers, those bundling hardware and software or more rarely, the perspective of third-party software developers developing valuable software 'apps' that add value to the overall platform. In this conceptual article, we grasp openness more holistically, both by acknowledging that openness means different things to different people and involve all stakeholders within the platforms/ecosystems. Towards the development of a theory of openness within digital settings, we propose six novel aspects of openness for enabling a greater understanding of the open-source software movement with a digital platforms/ecosystems perspective. Moreover, we invite scholars to reconsider the more predominating product-dominant logic in open-source software research to a more holistic logic embracing platforms and ecosystem thinking.

Design decisions are required concerning the properties and parameters of energy harvesting, conversion, and storage devices. The quantity and properties of environmental energy are typically both temporally and spatially variant, while the current consumption of the load electronics also changes dynamically. In this paper we describe Enspect, an open-source hardware/software tool which simplifies the design of energy harvesting sensing systems by assisting in the specification of harvesting and storage devices. It does this by enabling the long-term collection of data on energy availability, and modeling and simulating the performance of a complete system.

The new devices give us an unusual degree of connectivity in our regular activities, for example when we employ our tablets or smart phones to check email or browse the public network, but also in more innovative forms of connectivity, such as receiving notifications directly from our refrigerator or collecting information from our clothes and shoes. This technological revolution brings new opportunities and challenges for users, businesses, and society. This paper explores such a new context, where we begin to co-exist and interact with a network of interconnected devices that is known as the Internet of Things. The objective of the project is to implement a solution for communicating devices that monitor, in real-time, the structural health of a bridge. The implementation is based on 6LoWPAN, a standard based on the IPv6 protocol over low-power and lossy networks to support the Internet of Things. We employ open hardware platforms and emphasize the singularities of embedded systems, such as a limited number of operations, low power consumption, and low bandwidth capability.

It has touched almost all spheres concerning human survival, growth and development. Agriculture is no exception to it. This paper presents the research initiatives towards improving irrigation efficiency through affordable ICT solutions. It presents experimental results of studies related to improving irrigation efficiency in Semi arid zones in India, using commercially available ICT solutions. It compares between simple microirrigation and microirrigation with ICT (irrigation on demand) and establishes that by using ICT in agriculture, we can increase the irrigation efficiencies by a considerable amount. The paper also presents the development of indigenous wireless sensor node and gateway made from open source hardware and software components. The efforts in this regard show, while maintaining comparable performance, a significant reduction in the cost of wireless sensor devices, when compared to commercially available wireless sensor devices, is achieved.

Instead of a single-core processor, multi-core and many-core processors have been mainstream to accelerate applications by parallel processing. Year by year, the number of cores integrated in a single chip has been increased due to improvements of semiconductor integration technologies depending on Moore's Law. On the other hand, Moore's Law will be ended in the near future. This means that the approaches relying on the increase in the number of cores will be hopeless, thus we have to consider other effective ways. One of them is to design application specific hardware. Several research organizations have explored it and reported its remarkable findings. We focus on such an acceleration approach with dedicated hardware. As a case study with dedicated hardware, we present a sorting acceleration method. Sorting is an extremely important computation kernel that should be accelerated in a lot of fields, such as databases, image processing, data compression, etc. We propose a sorting accelerator combining Sorting Network and Merge Sorter Tree, and detail the design and implementation. Our proposed sorting accelerator is customizable, thus designers can implement a sorting accelerator composed of required hardware resources by means of tuning design parameters. Our experiments show that the proposed hardware achieves up to 10.06x sorting performance, compared with Intel Core i7-4770 operating at 3.4GHz, when sorting 256M 32-bits integer elements. In order to allow every designer to easily and freely use this accelerator, the RTL source code is released as an open-source hardware.

It is intended to improve the teaching of these concepts by providing a platform that is more open and understandable and by lowering the economic barriers to students interested in the field. To do this, the Lab-In-A-Box brings a full powered Digital Signal Processor (DSP) core to the popular Arduino microcontroller environment and marries it with a simple to use analog front end (AFE). The software platform provided with the Lab-In-A-Box includes an Arduino-like development environment that facilitates learning and quick development of signal processing applications without abstracting away the intricacies of a practical implementation. This system has been used to create several teaching examples and has been tested in courses at Stanford University.	[Esposito, William J.; Mujica, Fernando A.; Kovacs, Gregory T.

Using the ZigBee protocol, a low cost lighting control actuator was developed that was battery efficient and easy to use in a home automation system environment. Raspberry Pi was used to house a Web server, which provided the user an adaptive web application to access the lighting actuator control. XBee modules were chosen for their small size, low energy consumption and the large amount of documentation that exists in regard to its use. Considering the worst-case scenario, the lighting control actuator was designed so if its battery runs out of power or the ZigBee network fails, it can work as a normal light switch.

OpenMote is a open-hardware prototyping ecosystem designed to accelerate the development of the Industrial Internet of Things ( IIoT). It features the OpenMote-CC2538, a state-of-the-art computing and communication device. This device interfaces with several other accessories, or "skins", through a standardized connector. The skins developed to date include boards to provide power, boards which enable a developer to easily debug the platform, and boards to allow seamless integration of an OpenMote network into the Internet. This hardware ecosystem is complemented by a suite of software tools and ports to popular open-source IoT implementations. The OpenMote platform is for example tailored to run the OpenWSN open-source implementation of emerging IIoT standards. The combination of hardware and software ecosystems gives an embedded programmer an intuitive and complete development environment, and an end-user a fully working low-power wireless mesh networking solution running the latest IIoT standards.

Advances in open-source hardware allow students, researchers and hobbyists to custom build devices for a wide variety of purposes. Open-source prototyping platforms like Arduino and Raspberry Pi empower people to build cheap, modular, and easy to use alternatives to expensive commercial grade scientific equipment. The authors argue that the use of open-source hardware in building neuroIS research tools will dramatically decrease the costs and complexity associated with research in university laboratories. In this work, we discuss the use of open-source hardware in neuroIS research. We present the design of a neuroIS research tool based on BITalino, a biosignal capturing and processing platform. We also present a novel prototype that is specifically tuned toward neuroIS research using the API provided by the creators of BITalino.

Customers will be able to adapt the open platform to their needs by integrating modules of their choice into the platform, thereby constructing individual products that fit their exact needs. Large manufacturers will produce the platforms, and small companies will invent and produce modules that could be interfaced with the open-platform products. Smartphones is an example of an open-platform product, and the Apps that are designed to run on smartphones are examples for modules. Each customer downloads certain Apps that fit his/her needs, thereby creating an individual smartphone. The Apps, however, are software modules. The modules that are considered in this paper are hardware modules. Open-platform products will create a new paradigm in product design and utilization that we call the Mass-Individualization paradigm. The Mass-Individualization paradigm will boost the economy by (1) creating many new jobs in module production companies and (2) increasing the level of sales of consumer products.

Designing a robust control system requires to test the control algorithms in the actual controller hardware. However, WT are large and expensive, thus we would like to perform this test virtually, without using prototypes of the WT. This work develops a fault diagnosis (FD) and fault tolerant control (FTC) of pitch actuators in wind turbines. This is accomplished by combining a disturbance compensator with a controller, both of which are formulated in the discrete-time domain. The disturbance compensator has a dual purpose: to reconstruct the actuator fault (which is used by the FD technique) and to design the discrete-time controller to obtain a FTC. That is, the actuator faults are reconstructed and then the control inputs are modified to achieve a FTC with a comparable behavior to the fault-free case. The performance of the FD and FTC schemes is tested in a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) testbed for WT controllers. The used controller hardware is an open hardware Arduino board which is connected to the virtual WT via USB. The onshore 5MW turbine is simulated on the open-source National Renewable Energy Laboratory WT simulator FAST (Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structures, and Turbulence). The proposed HiL is used to characterize the behavior of the WT in the full load region in normal operation as well as under fault operation.

The technologies are released as open hardware, with the goal to develop servers and data centres following the model traditionally associated with open source software projects. In 2013 CERN acquired a few OCP servers in order to compare performance and power consumption with standard hardware. The conclusions were that there are sufficient savings to motivate an attempt to procure a large scale installation. One objective is to evaluate if the OCP market is sufficiently mature and broad enough to meet the constraints of a public procurement. This paper summarizes this procurement, which started in September 2014 and involved the Request for information (RFI) to qualify bidders and Request for Tender (RFT).

This realistic vision gives the surgeon the feeling of operating in real space. Hospital of Treviglio-Caravaggio isn't an university or scientific institution; in 2014 a new 3D laparoscopic technology was acquired therefore it led to evaluation of the of the appropriateness in term of patient outcome and safety. The project aims at achieving the development of a quantitative validation model that would ensure low cost and a reliable measure of the performance of 3D technology versus 2D mode. In addition, it aims at demonstrating how new technologies, such as open source hardware and software and 3D printing, could help research with no significant cost increase. For these reasons, in order to define criteria of appropriateness in the use of 3D technologies, it was decided to perform a study to technically validate the use of the best technology in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and safety in the use of a system between laparoscopic vision in 3D and the traditional 2D. METHODS: 30 surgeons were enrolled in order to perform an exercise through the use of laparoscopic forceps inside a trainer. The exercise consisted of having surgeons with different level of seniority, grouped by type of specialization (eg. surgery, urology, gynecology), exercising videolaparoscopy with two technologies (2D and 3D) through the use of a anthropometric phantom. The target assigned to the surgeon was that to pass "needle and thread" without touching the metal part in the shortest time possible. The rings selected for the exercise had each a coefficient of difficulty determined by depth, diameter, angle from the positioning and from the point of view. RESULTS: The analysis of the data collected from the above exercise has mathematically confirmed that the 3D technique ensures a learning curve lower in novice and greater accuracy in the performance of the task with respect to 2D.

With about 3.5 billion subscribers, GSM remains as the de facto standard for cellular communications. However, the security criteria envisioned 30 years ago, when the standard was designed, are no longer sufficient to ensure the security and privacy of the users. Furthermore, even with the newest fourth generation (4G) cellular technologies starting to be deployed, these networks could never achieve strong security guarantees because the MNOs keep backwards-compatibility given the huge amount of GSM subscribers. In this paper, we present and describe the tools and necessary steps to perform an active attack against a GSM-compatible network, by exploiting the GSM protocol lack of mutual authentication between the subscribers and the network. The attack consists of a so-called man-in-the-middle attack implementation. By using Software Defined Radio (SDR), open-source libraries and open-source hardware, we setup a fake GSM base station to impersonate the network and therefore eavesdrop any communications that are being routed through it and extract information from their victims. Finally, we point out some implications of the protocol vulnerabilities and how these can not be mitigated in the short term since 4G deployments will take long time to entirely replace the current GSM infrastructure.

The design of the headlamp emphasizes the importance of built-in resilience as way to achieve durability. Utilizing a highly-adaptable mechanical design accompanied with guiding design principles enables the headlamp to he implemented in an unlimited number of locations; during manufacture, the product will be embedded with locally-appropriate features that complement the materials and skills available in the region. Releasing the product with an open source hardware license fosters product adaptation for the design, manufacture, and use of the headlamp in various locations.

The military drones that kill civilians are unevenly distributed, geographically. The video "Our Drone Future" (Cornell) imagines a scenario where UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), with their technologies and capabilities, come to be pervasive in the skies of our future cities. The panoptic vision of the drone is a fundamental part of contemporary "complex of visuality" defined by the military-industrial complex, according to Mirzoeff. He proposes "the right to look" as a form of opposition to this alliance of visuality and power. The right to look from the skies as a practice of contravisuality using drones is claimed and exercised by an increasing number of hackers, artivists, social scientists, independent journalists and environmental activists, such as Mark Devries (FarmDrones) or Lot Amoros (Guerilla Drone, Flone). In order to investigate and act in the present on "Our future drone", we propose the creation of a citizen laboratory and a learning community in the use of UAVs as social technology. Drone Hackademy joined for a week ten representatives of collectives from Rio de Janeiro and other Brazilian cities. Participants were teached how and why to protect themselves from UAVs. Activities included the construction of free hardware and software UAVs such as Flone; and the production of an aerial mapping of the local community resisting eviction in the area annex to the Olympic Park.

One of DPB's functions is synchronization of Front End Electronics (FEE). To provide this functionality, it is necessary to receive the reference clock and timing signals from the Timing and Flow Control system. The received clock after the jitter cleaning will be used as a reference clock for GBT-FPGA based 4.8 Gbps links used for communication with front end electronics.

Development of an Inexpensive Sensor Network for Recognition of Sitting Posture	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Article								The aim of this work is the development of a network of wireless devices to determine, along with a time-stamp, postural changes of users that are to be used in personalized learning environments. For this purpose, we have designed a basic low-cost pressure sensor that can be built from components easily available. Several of these basic sensors (of sizes and shapes chosen specifically for the task) are integrated into a posture sensor cushion, which is electronically controlled by an Arduino microcontroller board. This accounts for experiments involving either a single cushion to be used by an individual end-user setting approach or classroom approaches where several of these cushions make up a sensor network via ZigBee wireless connections. The system thus formed is an excellent alternative to other more expensive commercial systems and provides a low-cost, easy-to-use, portable, scalable, autonomous, flexible solution with free hardware and software, which can be integrated with other sensing devices into a larger affect detection system, customizable to cope with postural changes at required time intervals and support single and collective oriented experimentation approaches.

The idea is to develop new sensors and transport service assisted by ICT platform to monitor fresh produce quality. The technology will be based on radio frequency (RF) wireless network, and will provide real-time and in-site data-logging, enabling active management of food products in storage and transit. The RF sensor network design, allows an auxiliary sensor node to be "plugged in". In this contribution we present the commercial platform developed starting from o fork of open hardware on which we assemble an array of commercial sensors in an "open air" configuration. We developed for this Embedded Gas Sensor System Device (Tinynose) two set-up: the "Development set-up" that uses a star wireless network infrastructure to store all raw sensor output and associated measurement error in a server DB to define parameters in ripening mathematical model and the "TAG set-up" that performs ripening evaluation in ICT in-site platform.

The necessity of including non-safety capabilities to reduce the price of these systems has resulted in a new type of critical systems, the mixed-criticality ones. These systems should be able to execute safety-critical applications but, at the same time, to run non-safety-critical functionalities without affecting the integrity of the safetycritical tasks. This paper presents a new system architecture which includes safetycritical and non-safety-critical parts in order to form a mixed-criticality system. The system consists of a reliable platform with a dual-core processor (implemented using a FPGA) architecture designed as open-hardware, running two isolated real-time operating systems which are connected through a safe core-to-core communication channel that executes the safety-critical applications. Moreover, the safety-critical system is connected to an external processor, an ARM9, which is used as an external sensing system. The ARM9 runs the non-safety-critical applications and allows the system to insert modifications updating without affecting the safety capabilities of the safetycritical part. This platform is described providing evidences of the isolation between safety-critical (SC) and non-safety-critical (NSC) applications, as well as describing an updating methodology for non-safety-critical applications. This system is validated using a complete and reliable application for safe emergency stop applications for industrial machinery.

Rapid Prototyping of a Wireless Sensor Network Gateway for the Internet of Things Using off-the-shelf Components	2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY (ICIT)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology (ICIT)	MAR 17-19, 2015	Seville, SPAIN	IEEE		Wireless Sensor Networks; Internet of Things; 6LoWPAN; Gateway; Commercial Off-the-shelf (COTS)		More than 50 billion devices are estimated to be connected to the Internet by 2020. Incompatibility of devices and protocols (usually proprietary devices and protocols) are one of the major hurdles to be overcome to realise the Internet of Things (IoT) vision. IoT devices are typically constrained devices and this creates dependencies between the hardware, software and protocols used in the device. Open hardware and software platforms to support emerging IoT trends are required. A wireless sensor network gateway was developed in a three-month period using off-the-shelf components. The gateway was based on the Raspberry PI single-board computer; it implemented 6LoWPAN mesh and wireless access point functionality for mobile and low power sensing and actuation devices. The gateway was tested in the following use-case: integrate a battery-operated 6LoWPAN-enabled smart water meter to an IPv6 building network. Several factors that influence the gateway's performance and reliability were identified and should be considered when deploying gateway devices for future endeavours.	[Kruger, C. P.; Abu-Mahfouz, A.

First, we summarize the range of current practices in wireless sensor network research projects by analyzing recent contributions in the literature. Specifically, for each wireless sensor network project, we compile details regarding the scope (e.g., simulation, testbed, real deployment), the type of mote used (e.g., TinyOS, Android, Arduino), and the type of sensors used (e.g., inertial, biological). Next, we discuss reasons why Arduino based wireless devices are perhaps the future of applied wireless sensor network research. Arduino-based systems are inexpensive, easy to use, readily available, well documented, 100% open-source (hardware and software), object oriented, extendable (using the "shield" concept), and flexible (e.g., in terms of radio choices). Lastly, we discuss the pros and cons of interdisciplinary research; that is, we highlight the struggle between working on difficult, relevant, inherently multi-disciplinary research problems while maintaining scholarship in individual fields.

The proposed design extends an existing open-source and open-hardware quadrotor project, i. e., the Crazyflie nano quadrotor, by adding the guidance, navigation and control layers required to accomplish autonomous flight. The control layer, in particular, is based on a cascade control algorithm able to globally stabilize the position and the attitude of the vehicle. The global property guaranteed by the algorithm allows the quadrotors to perform aggressive maneuvers. The guidance layer is designed to coordinate simultaneously multiple vehicles by generating suitable reference trajectories. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design.

In this paper, we investigate a way of using the aforementioned AT equipments in order to access many different devices without assistive preferences. The solution takes advantage of open source hardware and its core component consists of an affordable Linux embedded system: it grabs data coming from the assistive software, which runs on the user's personal device, then, after processing, it generates native keyboard and mouse HID commands for the target computing device controlled by the end user.

State of art equipment for stiffness evaluation are expensive, require expertise to operate and not amenable for field deployment. In this context, we developed ARTerial Stiffness Evaluation for Noninvasive Screening (ARTSENS), a device for image free, noninvasive, automated evaluation of vascular stiffness amenable for field use. ARTSENS has a frugal hardware design, utilizing a single ultrasound transducer to interrogate the carotid artery, integrated with robust algorithms that extract arterial dimensions and compute clinically accepted measures of arterial stiffness. The ability of ARTSENS to measure vascular stiffness in vivo was validated by performing measurements on 125 subjects. The accuracy of results was verified with the state-ofthe-art ultrasound imaging-based echo-tracking system. The relation between arterial stiffness measurements performed in sitting posture for ARTSENS measurement and sitting/supine postures for imaging system was also investigated to examine feasibility of performing ARTSENS measurements in the sitting posture for field deployment. This paper verified the feasibility of the novel ARTSENS device in performing accurate in vivo measurements of arterial stiffness. As a portable device that performs automated measurement of carotid artery stiffness with minimal operator input, ARTSENS has strong potential for use in large-scale screening.

Explored are the various methods that can be utilized to improve the percentage of STEM majors in the American educational system with resources such as: Open Source as Alternative (OSALT), virtualization, cloud computing, Linux distributions, open source programming, and open source hardware platforms. Increasing the amount of students that pursue STEM majors is important because the projected job growth in the STEM field compared to non-STEM jobs is 33%. OSALT provides cost-effective alternatives to commercial products such as Microsoft Office Suite and Adobe Photoshop. Second, creating Virtual Machines (VMs) is another avenue to teach complex concepts in computer science, engineering, and Information Technology (IT). Third, cloud computing is an inexpensive way for clients to access information from multiple locations and devices. Fourth, universities can use the Operating System (OS) Linux and its various distributions as replacements for commercial operating systems like Windows in order to reduce IT costs. Lastly, open source programming languages like Python and their associated Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provide comprehensive facilities for software engineers for application development or testing.

The research uses a low cost open hardware and an available multiplatform with open source applications. With this initiative, lab resources can be accessed from schools, as many of them have not appropriate science lab for practical activities. This reserch have been applied in two public schools from Ararangua/SC that also face difficulties when using the computer lab. As a solution, the students use their own mobile devices to do science and physics experiments accessing, controlling and observing real experiments installed in the Remote Experimentation Lab (RExLab). Making new experiments is a collaborative work with the teachers of these schools and with the lab staff to adapt their idea to a low cost system with the Raspberry Pi.

The cost of instrumentation, however, limits measurement frequency and number of sensors. The objective of this work was to design a low cost. open hardware. platform for multi-sensor measurements including water content at different depths, air and soil temperatures. The system is based on an open-source ARDUINO microcontroller-board, programmed in a simple integrated development environment (IDE). Low cost high-frequency dielectric probes were used in the platform and lab tested on three non-saline soils (ECe1: 2.5 < 0.1 mS/cm). Empirical calibration curves were subjected to cross-validation (leave-one-out method), and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) were respectively 0.09 for the overall model, 0.09 for the sandy soil, 0.07 for the clay loam and 0.08 for the sandy loam. The overall model (pooled soil data) fitted the data very well (R-2 = 0.89) showing a high stability, being able to generate very similar RMSEs during training and validation (RMSEtraining = 2.63; RMSEvalidation = 2.61). Data recorded on the card were automatically sent to a remote server allowing repeated field-data quality checks. This work provides a framework for the replication and upgrading of a customized low cost platform, consistent with the open source approach whereby sharing information on equipment design and software facilitates the adoption and continuous improvement of existing technologies.

Therefore, the need for a suitable open source system that can be used as a prototype platform to test new network functionality while ensuring line-rate processing, accurate timestamping, and reduced power consumption has become evident. All these requirements cannot be achieved by using software-only solutions, but rather with hardware-based platforms such as NetFPGA. The main obstacle when using this type of open source FPGA-based solution is the cost of development, in both time and hardware development skills required. The spread of new circuit synthesis tools using high-level languages opens the door for the development of hardware-based networking applications with reasonable development effort, compared to the use of traditional hardware description languages. In this article, we describe how existing open source hardware-based platforms for networking applications will be fueled by the change in the programming model of FPGAs provided by modern high-level synthesis tools. For this, we implemented a network flow monitor using high-level languages and compared the effort spent with respect to a traditional hardware development cycle. Preliminary results are very promising, given that development time is reduced from months to weeks.

OPEN-SOURCE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE AND WEB APPLICATION FOR GAMMA DOSE RATE NETWORK OPERATION	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							SYSTEM	The German Federal Office for Radiation Protection operates a network of about 1800 gamma dose rate stations as a part of the national emergency preparedness plan. Each of the six network centres is capable of operating the network alone. Most of the used hardware and software have been developed in-house under open-source license. Short development cycles and close cooperation between developers and users ensure robustness, transparency and fast maintenance procedures, thus avoiding unnecessary complex solutions. This also reduces the overall costs of the network operation. An easy-to-expand web interface has been developed to make the complete system available to other interested network operators in order to increase cooperation between different countries. The interface is also regularly in use for education during scholarships of trainees supported, e. g. by the 'International Atomic Energy Agency' to operate a local area dose rate monitoring test network.

Although a number of platforms have been specifically designed for the general public and are supported by a vast array of on-line tutorials, this subject is not normally included in university chemistry curricula. Aiming to provide the basic concepts of hardware and software, this article is focused on the design and use of a simple module to control a series of PDMS-based valves. The module is based on a low-cost microprocessor (Teensy) and open-source software (Arduino). The microvalves were fabricated using thin sheets of PDMS and patterned using CO2 laser engraving, providing a simple and efficient way to fabricate devices without the traditional photolithographic process or facilities. Synchronization of valve control enabled the development of two simple devices to perform injection (1.6 +/- 0.4 mu L/stroke) and mixing of different solutions. Furthermore, a practical demonstration of the utility of this system for microscale chemical sample handling and analysis was achieved performing an on-chip acid-base titration, followed by conductivity detection with an open-source low-cost detection system. Overall, the system provided a very reproducible (98%) platform to perform fluid delivery at the microfluidic scale.

Modern analog and digital communication systems development using GNU Radio with USRP	TELECOMMUNICATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Software defined radio (SDR); Community radio; Radio data system (RDS)		In this modern world many communication devices are highly intelligent and interconnected between each other. Any up-gradation of the hardware in the existing communication devices is not easier one. Compatibility of the new hardware with existing hardware is highly essential. But the new protocols may or may not support the older one. The solution for these problems can be provided by using the reconfigurable hardware design. The hardware can be reprogrammed according to the new change in technology up-gradation. The cost of commercially available hardware and software requirements for setting up such a module is very high. This can be solved by using Open source hardware and software such as Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) and GNU Radio. This work demonstrates how the modern analog communication system like Community Radio Schemes and Radio Data System (RDS) and digital communication systems such as Simple Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) and OFDM based data communication can be developed using the Open source hardware USRP1. This work will be helpful even for first year level of engineering students to easily implement any communication and control applications with cheaper cost.

A modular, platform-based, approach is the way to obtain this result. Modular approaches are common for software development, but hardware is still crafted often re-inventing solutions every time. As a consequence, the resources that should be invested in the development of a new robot get often drained by the implementation of a physical, working prototype to test the application idea. To overcome this problem, we propose R2P (Rapid Robot Prototyping), a framework to implement real-time, high-quality architectures for robotic systems with off-the-shelf basic modules (e.g., sensors, actuators, and controllers), integrating hardware and software, which can be assembled in a plug-and-play way. R2P provides hardware modules, a protocol for real-time communication, a middleware to connect components as well as tools to support the development of software on the modules. R2P aims at dramatically reduce time and efforts required to build a prototype robot, making it possible to focus the resources on the development of new robotic applications instead of struggling on their implementation. This enables also people with experience in a specific application domain, but with little technical background, to actively participate in the development of new robotic applications. R2P is open-source both in its software and hardware to promote its diffusion among the robotics community and novel business models that will substantially reduce the costs to design a new robotic product.

Often computer screens, speakers and keyboards are sufficient. However, these devices are not appropriate for some situations. For example, some studies present tactile or olfactory stimuli or brain stimulation. Likewise, keyboard buttons are not appropriate for use with vocal responses, small animals or individuals with motor impairments. New method: We describe StimSync, which simulates USB keyboard inputs, allowing use with most experimental software. StimSync can measure button presses, optical signals from magnetic resonance imaging systems, changes in ambient light (e.g. synchronizing intracranial electrography), and auditory events (a voice key). In addition to the USB keyboard mode (necessarily millisecond precision), StimSync can also be set to provide higher precision timing. This feature can be used to validate timing, ensuring event synchronization (e.g. auditory events, visual events, brain stimulation). In addition to recording inputs, StimSync provides seven digital outputs for controlling external devices. Finally, StimSync can record analog inputs; we illustrate how this can be used to evaluate the rise time for computer displays. Results: We observed outputs with a mean latency of 2.1 ms (sd = 0.17 ms) and USB inputs with a mean latency of 2 ms (sd = 0.54 ms). Comparison with existing method(s): StimSync statistically outperforms two professional solutions and numerically outperforms other devices described in the literature. Conclusions: StimSync (http://www.mccauslandcenter.sc.edu/CRNL/tools/stimsync) provides an open-source solution for controlling and validating neuroscience experiments. In addition to sharing the design, we have produced a batch of devices to demonstrate the market for professional implementations. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

A turbidimeter is an electronic/optical instrument that assesses turbidity by measuring the scattering of light passing through a water sample containing such colloidal particles. Commercial turbidimeters cost hundreds or thousands of dollars, putting them beyond the reach of low-resource communities around the world. An affordable open-source turbidimeter based on a single light-to-frequency sensor was designed and constructed, and evaluated against a portable commercial turbidimeter.

Before the tape-out, a pre-silicon design has to be thoroughly inspected by time-consuming functional verification and code review to exclude bugs. For functional verification and code review, a critical issue determining their efficiency is the allocation of resources (e.g., computational resources and manpower) to different modules of a design, which is conventionally guided by designers' experiences. Such practices, though simple and straightforward, may take high risks of wasting resources on bug-free modules or missing bugs in buggy modules, and thus could affect the success and timeline of the tape-out. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called pre-silicon bug forecast to predict the bug information of hardware designs. In this framework, bug models are built via machine learning techniques to characterize the relationship between design characteristics and the bug information, which can be leveraged to predict how bugs distribute in different modules of the current design. Such predicted bug information is adequate to regulate the resources among different modules to achieve efficient functional verification and code review. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed pre-silicon bug forecast framework, we conducted detailed experiments on several open-source hardware projects. Moreover, we also investigate the impacts of different learning techniques and different sets of characteristic on the performance of bug models. Experimental results show that with appropriate learning techniques and characteristics, about 90% modules could be correctly predicted as buggy or clean and the number of bugs of each module could also be accurately predicted.

The developed mobile robotic system is open hardware. Its base part - a mobile robotic platform - is being continuously extended by expansion modules to enable the development and implementation of the specific applications. As the first expansion module for the "Yrobot", an audio-communication subsystem module based on Texas Instruments solutions has been developed. This extension module is called "AudioCom" and allows the development and verification of the simple modulation techniques operation. These techniques are commonly used in the radio frequency communication as well. This paper describes the motivation for the development of the mentioned platform, the expansion module circuit design, software solution and the experimental testing results.

In this paper, we consider littleBits - and the littleBits SynthKit in particular - as a physically-embodied domain specific programming language. We describe the littleBits system, explain how littleBits "programs" are constructed as configurations of physical modules in the real world, and describe how they are typically used to control physical artefacts or constructions. We then argue that littleBits constructions essentially "visualise themselves". We describe how littleBits' liveness, embodiment, and plasticity assists both learning and debugging, and then evaluate littleBits configurations according to the cognitive dimensions of notations.

It aims to contribute to a discussion on the importance of sensing-based mapping of urban phenomena following our assertion that current delivery of urban analysis methodologies, with their emphasis on visuo-spatial analysis only, fail to create maps that reflect the nuanced and layered interrelationships between the people and the physical environmental space they live in. In essence, the paper will bring to light the set up components and deployment of a mobile sensing kit that allows for usually mapped static invisible data (air quality, temperature, humidity) to be mapped as visible data. In other words, we want to explore how real-time geo-referenced data collection can enhance traditional data mapping and visualization methods enabling designers to understand better the urban space.

This promotes the development of new monitoring tools, and especially those with outstanding reliability and response time, and nonstationary features. This paper presents the design and implementation of a transportable gas detection and environmental monitoring device. Ideas taken from the Arduino and Lego constructions are kept in mind during the design of the device, looking further facilitate the development of product family of this device; likewise, the use of reconfigurable and interconnectable platforms with open hardware are considered. The transducers have been selected based on their reliability, small size and easy inclusion in an electronic system. Then, was developed a device that supports transducers for environmental gases, such as: carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O-3), volatile organic compounds (VOC), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2); as well as the possibility to interface with other systems for common gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxygen (O-2) before developed. Other environmental measures such as speed and wind direction, temperature and relative humidity, may also be included. In this case, a configurable platform based on mixed-signal circuits, PSoC5, was used for the development of embedded system. This platform can be interfaced with different Arduino shields and achieves the integration of several analog functions. This system manages, acquires and processes signals from the above transducers. The measurements can be displayed on an LCD display, save into an SD memory and send to the Web using Ethernet interface. The device is hand size, easy to carry and can operate with a battery. Its user interface is simple and provides updated and in-situ readings. Currently, successful results have been obtained from the functional and metrology testing of the manufactured prototype.

Condition monitoring of electrical machines using low computing power devices	2014 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES (ICEM)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Electrical Machines (ICEM)	SEP 02-05, 2014	Berlin, GERMANY	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, IEEE Ind Elect Soc, VDI, Power Engn Soc		Induction motor; Fault diagnosis; Extended Park Vector; Fourier transforms; Condition monitoring; Motor-current signature analysis; Broken rotor bar detection; Programmable logic controllers; Signal processing	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; INDUCTION MACHINES; BAR DETECTION; SPECTRUM; MOTORS; ALGORITHM; SIGNATURE	The diagnosis of electrical motors through the detection of fault frequency signatures in the current's spectrum has become an established standard in the field of industrial maintenance systems. Nevertheles, its implementation on devices with low computing power remains a practical challenge. Industrial controllers, such as programmable logic controllers, or modern, low cost controller hardware, such as the Arduino or the Raspberry Pi open source hardware proposals, lack both the on-board memory and the high speed data acquisition hardware to perform an accurate spectral analysis of the machine's current, in order to identify the spectral components produced by each type of fault. In this paper, a signal conditioning unit, based on a novel downsampling method of the current, is presented. This unit reduces the amount of current samples that must be processed by the diagnostic unit to a mere sample per current cycle, maintains the sub-hertz accuracy needed to resolve fault, and converts the mains component into a constant value that can be easily eliminated without using any additional filter. Besides, it is implemented using low cost devices, just resistors and operational amplifiers. The proposed method is theoretically developed in this paper, and it has been validated using induction motors with broken bars fed directly by the mains or through variable speed drives.

Several commercial and open-source solutions are available, based on dedicated hardware and/or open-source software. These solutions aim to achieve a tradeoff between performance and instrumentation cost. In general, high performance and precise monitoring tools are based on dedicated hardware, which is expensive. In contrast, cheaper software-based solutions working on top of a Commercially available Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware are performance-limited, especially when serving high-capacity links. In this context, the paper presents an open-source solution for QoS monitoring of VoIP traffic that achieves high performance at significantly lower costs. The proposed solution exploits the performance capabilities achievable with a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The associated costs reduction arises from the high flexibility of an FPGA. Our experimental analysis explores the accuracy of the developed prototype, measuring against relevant QoS parameters of VoIP traffic on high capacity links.

In 2011, the Humanitarian Initiatives Committee (HIC) of IEEE Region 7 organized a student design competition [1] with the specific objective of understanding the design process of HT "Solutions" to be made available as open source. The 2011 competition was an initial effort to understand open source licensing, open source hardware and the open source development model. Adoption of the open source development model was a stated objective of IEEE's Humanitarian technology Challenge (HTC) [2]. The HIC held a student paper competition in 2013. The goal of the 2013 competition was to nurture the growing interest in Humanitarian Technology in Region 7; to address HIC's concerns from the 2011 competition, more effort was focused in the paper review process for the 2013 competition and standard IEEE peer-review tools and processes were used. This document presents in Section III the lessons learned during these two competitions, and proposes in section IV a Product Lifecycle Management framework for the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) of OSI development that leverages IEEE's peer-review process.

Advances in low cost additive-manufacturing processes (i.e. 3D-printers) and the development of open-hardware projects, which have produced inexpensive and easily programmable micro-controllers and micro-computers (i.e. Arduino and Raspberry Pi) have opened a new door for individuals seeking to make their own devices. Here we describe the potential for these technologies to reduce costs in construction and development of submillimeter/millimeter astronomical instrumentation. Specifically we have begun a program to measure the optical properties of the custom plastics used in 3D-printers as well as the printer accuracy and resolution to assess the feasibility of directly printing sub/millimeter transmissive optics. We will also discuss low cost designs for cryogenic temperature measurement and control utilizing Arduino and Raspberry Pi.

Color Science Demonstration Kit from Open Source Hardware and Software	OPTICS EDUCATION AND OUTREACH III	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	3rd Conference on Optics Education and Outreach	AUG 18-20, 2014	San Diego, CA	SPIE		Color Science; LEDs; Education; Outreach		Color science is perhaps the most universally tangible discipline within the optical sciences for people of all ages. Excepting a small and relatively well-understood minority, we can see that the world around us consists of a multitude of colors; yet, describing the "what", "why", and "how" of these colors is not an easy task, especially without some sort of equally colorful visual aids. While static displays (e.g., poster boards, etc.) serve their purpose, there is a growing trend, aided by the recent permeation of small interactive devices into our society, for interactive and immersive learning. However, for the uninitiated, designing software and hardware for this purpose may not be within the purview of all optical scientists and engineers. Enter open source. Open source "anything" are those tools and designs -- hardware or software -- that are available and free to use, often without any restrictive licensing. Open source software may be familiar to some, but the open source hardware movement is relatively new. These are electronic circuit board designs that are provided for free and can be implemented in physical hardware by anyone. This movement has led to the availability of some relatively inexpensive, but quite capable, computing power for the creation of small devices. This paper will showcase the design and implementation of the software and hardware that was used to create an interactive demonstration kit for color. Its purpose is to introduce and demonstrate the concepts of color spectra, additive color, color rendering, and metamers.

The proposed framework comprises a set of gas sensors (ozone, CO, and NO2) that are deployed on stacks and infrastructure of a Zigbee WSN and a central server to support both short-term real-time incident management and a long-term strategic planning. This architecture would use open-hardware open-software gas sensing capable motes [6] made by Libelium. These motes use the ZigBee communication protocol and provide a real-time low cost monitoring system through the use of low cost, low data rate, and low power wireless communication technology. The proposed monitoring system can be transferred to or shared by other applications. We also introduce a simple but efficient clustering protocol dubbed hereafter "Clustering Protocol for Air Sensor network" (CPAS) for the proposed WSN-AQMS framework. CPAS proves to be efficient in terms of network energy consumption, network lifetime, and the rate at which data is communicated.

The dynamics of the WT are simulated on the open-source National Renewable Energy Laboratory WT simulator called FAST (Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structures, and Turbulence), which emulates all required input signals of the controller and reacts to the controller commands (almost) like an onshore real turbine of 5 MW. The dynamic torque control system runs on an open hardware Arduino microcontroller board, which is connected to the virtual WT via USB. In particular, the power generation control in the full load region for variable-speed variable-pitch wind turbines is considered through torque and pitch control. The HIL proposed platform is used to characterize the behavior of the WT in normal operation as well as in fault operation. In particular, a stuck/unstuck fault is modeled and the behavior of a proposed chattering torque controller is analyzed in comparison to a baseline torque controller.

The pilot project for this initiative is the Multi-Purpose Avionics Core Element (M-PACE). The primary goal of M-PACE is to demonstrate advanced manufacturing techniques, such as additive manufacturing and Digital Materials, to minimize the cost of cube satellites and increase their modularity. M-PACE will be designed and built at the NASA Ames' SpaceShop, which is a state-of-the-art advanced manufacturing facility built for NASA researchers to formulate ideas for projects. The final products of M-PACE are several completed side panels of a one-unit (1U) (10 cm cube) cube satellite prototype built using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components, which will show the basic functionality of the internal payload by connecting it to the side panels for power and other subsystem capabilities. Within the structure, we are investigating the use of Digital Materials, which are universal building materials with the ability to increase precision and ease of assembly and disassembly of three dimensional (3D) objects. M-PACE will use COTS power systems and open-source hardware and software to distribute data through Ethernet through the use of snap-fit card connectors. Similar to Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) Express cards, we envision the spacecraft subsystems and payloads to be on a PC104-like board that will slide into the side panel connectors to enable distribution of power and data. This design has the potential to greatly reduce the cost of Cube Satellite testing and integration due to the absence of wires and ease of access to internal boards for any necessary modifications.

Scientist believes that the main cause of this is because of the deforestation, pollution, carbon emission from transportation and factories that led to this global warming. However, there are also skeptics that believe otherwise. To prove the cause of global warming and whether it is an event that occurs every now and then as some skeptics and scientists suggested a multi sensor device is build, which consist of temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide and oxygen. With limited funding and a few different location to be tested to prove this phenomena, a low cost device is built so that it will be within the budget of this project as well give the result that is to determine whether development has cause the global warming and forest and absorbing the CO2 emission to keep the world cool.

The microgrid control and coordination infrastructure has been realized as a hierarchical multi-agent system (MAS) comprising of the DG agents, the Mu agent and the D agent. The Communication (Mu) Agent acts as a link between the lower-level microgrid agents (distributed energy resources (DERs), the load, the storage and the utility grid) which provide the required digital parameter inputs, and the Control Agent comprising of the Cloud. Data storage, analytics and control commands are generated based on the rule engine updates given by the Utility Service Provider (USP) to the Cloud. The microgrid side input data are converted into appropriate GPRS signals within the Arduino. The specific functions that enable this conversion are elucidated as pseudocode. Further, the cloud control commands are sent back to the various microgrid-side agents via the Mu agent as GPRS signals. The communication strategy has been explained in detail and has been implemented using Arduino keeping in mind system costs, ease of operability and maintenance.	[Dhiwaakar, Purusothaman S. R.

It has undergone substantial transformations over the centuries. For this reason, the historical and critical interpretation requires a key capable of simplifying the understanding of all the modifications. Starting from both an archival study and an architectural survey, we created different 3D models to help analyze and understand all the historical and architectural phases of the complex. The 3D-model reconstructions are based on metric and land surveys. The survey permitted us to identify seven main historical phases. In this way knowledge of the abbey becomes an elaborate history that needs an appropriate dissemination tool. The abbey is now abandoned due to its poor state and no action has been taken for its improvement or preservation. A first step in raising awareness of this forgotten cultural object is to foster better knowledge of its history through a new visual interface that is able to clarify all the events that have occurred over time. In order to explain the complex history of the abbey, we tested a new approach based on the use of a mock-up as a physical interface allowing access to different digital content. For this purpose we used open-source hardware: an Arduino-based microcontroller, named Makey Makey, connected to different parts of the mock-up through wired buttons. In this way, the computer processes the signal coming from the buttons using the mock-up like a keyboard to manage all the information related to the abbey.

A Course for Teaching Integrated System Design to Computer Engineering Students	2014 IEEE GLOBAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION CONFERENCE (EDUCON)	IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference	APR 03-05, 2014	Istanbul, TURKEY	IEEE		component; Teaching Integrated System Design; Computer Engineering; Lilypad; Arduino; Zigbee		While cornerstone and capstone courses teach "design" at the beginning and end of many computer engineering programs, a design gap is left in the sophomore and junior years. This paper describes the development and experiences of teaching five semesters of a specialized design course for a computer engineering program taught in the junior year. The course includes topics in software design patterns, multi-threaded applications, rudimentary user-interface design, embedded programming including sensor building and processing, and Zigbee-based wireless communications. The course is 2 semester credits (1-2-3), and includes a comprehensive project that requires students to build a tangible game or a game-like entertainment system. One key component of the course is the use of an open-source hardware platform called Arduino. The results are that students enjoy the course and are able to build integrated systems that incorporate design patterns, multi-threading, embedded programming and wireless communication in an effective manner within one semester.

Currently the technological resources have been misused in education, and the potential use of mobile devices in education is virtually untapped. The architecture implemented enables the users to control real experiments and to monitor results via video streaming, which provides a sense of involvement similar to hands-on laboratories. The authors describe the deployment of this mobile learning tool in a second year Brazilian public high school. The mobile application uses HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery Mobile in order to maintain compatibility among the platforms widely used. The VLE Moodle has been used in order to provide homework, assignments and teaching material. The experiments have been automated using open hardware and software sources, which facilitate replication in different areas.	[de Lima, J. P. C.; Rochadel, W.; Silva, A. M.; Simao, J. P.

Arduino and Nagios integration for monitoring	20TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTING IN HIGH ENERGY AND NUCLEAR PHYSICS (CHEP2013), PARTS 1-6	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	20th International Conference on Computing in High Energy and Nuclear Physics (CHEP)	OCT 14-18, 2013	Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS					The data centre at the Galician Institute of High Energy Physics (IGFAE) of the Santiago de Compostela University (USC) is a computing cluster with about 150 nodes and 1250 cores that hosts the LHCb Tiers 2 and 3. In this small data centre, and of course in similar or bigger ones, it is very important to keep optimal conditions of temperature, humidity and pressure. Therefore, it is a necessity to monitor the environment and be able to trigger alarms when operating outside the recommended settings. There are currently many tools and systems developed for data centre monitoring, but until recent years all of them were of commercial nature and expensive. In recent years there has been an increasing interest in the use of technologies based on Arduino due to its open hardware licensing and the low cost of this type of components. In this article we describe the system developed to monitor IGFAE's data centre, which integrates an Arduino controlled sensor network with the Nagios monitoring software. Sensors of several types, temperature, humidity and pressure, are connected to the Arduino board. The Nagios software is in charge of monitoring the various sensors and, with the help of Nagiosgraph, to keep track of the historic data and to produce the plots. An Arduino program, developed in house, provides the Nagios plugin with the readout of one or several sensors depending on the plugin's request. The Nagios plugin for reading the temperature sensors also broadcasts an SNMP trap when the temperature gets out of the allowed operating range.

Although many low-cost methods have been developed to treat contaminated water, low-cost methods for water-quality testing are necessary to determine if these appropriate technologies are needed, effective, and reliable. This paper provides a methodology for the design, development, and technical validation of a low-cost, open-source (OS) water testing platform. A case study is presented where the platform is developed to provide both the colorimetry for biochemical oxygen demand/chemical oxygen demand and nephelometry to measure turbidity using method ISO 7027. This approach resulted in equipment that is as accurate, but costs between 7.5 and 15 times less than current commercially available tools. It is concluded that OS hardware development is a promising solution for the equipment necessary to perform water quality measurements in both developed and developing regions.

A pinch-valve interface for automated sampling and monitoring of dynamic processes by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry	ANALYTICAL METHODS			English	Article							TRANSESTERIFICATION-BASED ASSAY; OPEN-SOURCE HARDWARE; BIODIESEL PRODUCTION; ENZYME ASSAYS; INJECTION; LIPASES; OIL; LAB	Gas chromatography (GC) is frequently used in qualitative and quantitative analysis of volatile organic molecules. In its most common embodiment, samples are prepared in the laboratory, and injected into the capillary column using an autosampler. Analytes are separated, and detected by one of several available detection systems, including mass spectrometry (MS). However, this mode of operation is not convenient when monitoring dynamic chemical systems - for example, reaction mixtures. Here we present a facile approach for automated sampling, and subsequent introduction of samples to a GC apparatus in order to enable monitoring of dynamic chemical processes in real time. The proposed system incorporates two pinch valves, a peristaltic pump, a thermoshaker, and an electronic control unit (Raspberry Pi microcomputer) with several relays. The device facilitates dosing small volumes of liquid samples to the injection port of a commercial GC-MS apparatus. A program in C language controls the operation of the pump (on/off, direction of flow) and actuation of the pinch valves, and it initiates GC-MS runs. The system has been characterised with artificial samples, and successfully used in the monitoring of transesterification reactions catalysed by single microbeads containing immobilised lipase, as well as in the monitoring of the extraction of natural products from plant tissue samples. We believe that - following further improvements - this automated approach may be adapted for monitoring industrial processes and environmental analysis.

This paper is only focused on the improvement of line rasterization speed. Besides modifying the algorithm itself, hardware implementation and resource consumption are put into consideration here. Originally, ORGFX uses the classic Bresenham line algorithm with high precision and simple logic to rasterize lines, but this algorithm can only generate one pixel in each rasterization process, which results in efficiency relatively low. New algorithm in this paper combines Bresenham algorithm with the symmetry nature of lines, advantages of Bresenham algorithm are kept and rasterization speed is improved in this way. The results of experiments show that nearly 50 percent of time can be saved through software implementation and hardware implementation.

Robust and accessible, it allows exploring quickly and easily the fabrication, the programming and the experimentation of various robotic morphologies. Both hardware and software are open-source, and a web platform allows interdisciplinary contributions, sharing and collaborations. Finally we conduct an experiment to explore the impact of four different foot morphologies on the robot's dynamic when it makes a footstep.

Technological innovation in the field of medical devices directly touches the lives of millions of people; not just patients but doctors and other technicians as well. Serving these care givers is serving humanity. Growth of Mobil Devices and Cloud Computing has changed the way we live and work. We try to bring the benefits of these technological innovations to the medical field via equipment which can improve the working efficiencies and capabilities of the medical professionals and technicians. The improvements in the camera and image processing capabilities of the Mobile Devices coupled with their improved processing power and an infinite processing and storage offered by Cloud Computing infrastructure opens up a window of opportunity to use them in the specialized field like microsurgery. To enable microsurgery, surgeons use optical microscope to zoom into the working area to get better visibility and control. However, these devices suffer from various drawbacks and are not comfortable to use. We build a Tablet with large stereoscopic screen allowing glasses free 3D display enabled by cameras capable of capturing 3D video and enhanced by an image processing pipeline, greatly improves the visibility and viewing comfort of the surgeon. Moreover using the capabilities of Cloud computing, these surgeries can be recorded and streamed live for education, training and consultation. An expert sitting in a geographically remote location can guide the surgeon performing the surgery. All vital parameters of the patient undergoing surgery can be shown as an overlay on the Tablet screen so that the surgeon is alerted of any parameter going beyond limit. Developing this kind of complex device involves engineering skills in hardware and software and huge amount of investments in terms of time, resources and money. To accelerate the development, we make use of open source hardware and software and demonstrate how we can accelerate the development using these open source resources.

Evaluation of an Introductory Embedded Systems Programming Tutorial using Hands-on Learning Methods	2014 ASEE ANNUAL CONFERENCE	ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition		English	Proceedings Paper	ASEE Annual Conference	JUN 15-18, 2014	Indianapolis, IN	ASEE				The rapid advancement of low cost embedded systems invites engineering educators to deliver content and skills while engaging students in hands-on projects that may potentially make use of a variety of platforms. From proprietary to open source hardware and software, from microcontrollers to embedded operating systems (OS) devices, students today are challenged to accelerate their learning pace by working on real-world projects in a supervised environment. Currently, students rely on self-guidance in order to develop the knowledge base necessary for achieving the goals of their team projects with respect to embedded systems. This paper presents the results of an embedded systems programming tutorial piloted with a group of 15 undergraduate students from across the engineering disciplines and with a mix of sophomores through seniors. The tutorial included a series of three lecture modules prepared to introduce concepts on embedded systems. The modules were tightly coupled with hands-on exercises that employed the DE2i-150 development board, aimed to introduce students to the development of digital systems based on an Altera field programmable gate array (FPGA) in conjunction with an Linux-based embedded OS running on an Intel Atom processor. The first module provides an overview of the various inputs, outputs, sensors, and displays of the board. The second module introduces the embedded OS and guides students in establishing a high-speed Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) link between the Atom processor and the FPGA. The third module focuses on implementing a custom C/++ application written by students for real-time processing of inputs from four push buttons. Results show that the three lecture modules of 30 minutes each, coupled with the hands-on projects, offer a good introduction to the complexity of the DE2i-150 board. Surveys collected before the first module and after the third show a generally positive outcome. Recommendations for future efforts focus on incorporating more complex C/++ applications concurrent with FPGA development.

Historically, good platforms for a controls laboratory have been expensive, because the equipment has typically been very specialized for educational purposes. Moreover, the equipment often is not physically robust in the face of student manhandling, creating major difficulties and costs in maintaining such a lab. The advent of inexpensive open-source controller hardware is revolutionizing this situation because it is now possible to have good controls-hardware capability at relatively low cost. The Arduino Mega 2560, in particular, is supported by Matlab, Simulink and LabView, and thus provides a great deal of flexibility in developing laboratory procedures for students to study controls. The Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. The "motor shield" is an add-on (daughterboard) to the Arduino that further enables control of dc motors. This paper explains a method and hardware to connect an Arduino to a separately-powered dc-motor unit. Matlab and Simulink provide full support of the Arduino board for feedback-controller design. The Arduino board is powered by, and communicates with Simulink, through a standard USB connection.

The design implementation of the proof of concept employs open-source hardware architecture using Arduino and off-the-shelf sensors which lends itself to mass production, low cost and easy maintenance. This system is intended to service rural and low income urban consumers who will not be able to afford existing sophisticated and expensive home automation systems. A device identification module (DIM) that recognizes the devices in use at every room is implemented. The energy usage is continuously monitored and the user is notified of his consumption over a twenty four hour period. As many of the intended users are possible first time energy consumers, the energy monitoring system will inculcate a sense of energy consciousness and ensure grass root level sustainability. The energy consumption data is logged in the system and can be used by the utility service provider (USP) for future system planning, optimization and demand side management. The proof of concept developed and tested under laboratory conditions costs under USD 11 and will reduce further on commercialization.

The proposal has been adopted in the Computer Engineering undergraduate program at the Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul (UFMS) - Brazil. Most of the ICE courses from computer engineering programs around the world have put focus on teaching initial basic theoretical concepts of algorithms, logic, and digital systems. The ICE course at UFMS has been organized to encompass from initial basic concepts up to a practical and motivating set of experimental activities in order to clarify the program focus and to connect the concepts to practical applications. To evaluate the impacts of this new curriculum and methodology, an online anonymous survey has been carried out with students from 2011, 2012, and 2013 classes. After a statistical analysis and validation of the answers, 28% of the students have pointed that the activities have been determinant to increase their motivation to study computer engineering. The impacts on students motivation, since the first semester, have been observed in the students evasion rate. The percentage of evasions in the computer engineering is less than other engineering programs at UFMS.

It is based on a smart gas sensor and consists of a commercial fork of open hardware, on which we assembly an array of commercial sensors suitable for air quality monitoring. In particular, to measure ethylene (ripening marker) a class of unspecific metal oxide commercial sensors has been selected and tested, in controlled environment, to probe the response capability to extremely low gas concentration (less than tens ppm). Firmware implemented uses a power management strategy to minimize device consumption. It is able to save locally raw data and transmit, on request, an index correlated to the vegetable ripening. The index results from a mathematical model based on time-integral function depending on the vegetable transport parameters, temperature, humidity and gas sensor outputs. Work in progress deals to optimize the algorithm and mathematical model implemented in device with Onsite experimentation.

First, a set of technological competencies are defined for technology class, based on the suggestions of the Ministry of National Education. Then, a project for designing an irrigation system for the school orchard is presented, which will engage students to develop the selected technological competencies. Subsequently, a set of didactic tools for the project are presented, including an electronic platform for the control of the water flux in the irrigation system. The project will be implemented during the following months, and through diagnostic and summative assessment it is expected to measure the improvement of the technological competencies in students.

The FIR-filter core is based on the transpose realization form, the IIR-filter core is based on the Second Order Sections (SOS) architecture and the FFT core is based on the Radix 2(2) Single Delay Feedback (R2(2) SDF) architecture. The three cores are compatible with the Wishbone SoC bus, and they were described using generic and structural VHDL. In-system hardware verification was performed by using an OpenRisc-based SoC synthesized on an Altera FPGA. Tests showed that the designed DSP cores are suitable for building SoC based on the OpenRisc processor and the Wishbone bus.

OPEN-HARDWARE SOLUTIONS IN THE EDUCATION OF CIVIL ENGINEER STUDENTS	EDULEARN14: 6TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND NEW LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES	EDULEARN Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN)	JUL 07-09, 2014	Barcelona, SPAIN			Innovation; technology; Open-Hardware; European Space of Higher Education		We have detected a great gap between teaching of structural mechanics and the real world applications related with this subject. The European Space of Higher Education requires a higher proportion of practical content in courses, so that students can develop skills to solve real problems in the development of their professional practice. Therefore, we have the challenge of develop new laboratory practices to reduce the gap between theoretical contents of the classes and the aforementioned real world applications. When we faced with this problem, we realized that usual commercial equipments for educational laboratories are quite limited in flexibility and are often quite expensive. In this work we show how we have implemented the practices for a structural mechanics course in the second year of civil engineering studies using open hardware solutions. For this purpose we built our own devices and involved students from different courses and specialties, including undergraduate researchers in the development of the different mechanical and electronic components. The main aim of the present work has been the creation of a self-teaching experience for students, where they can freely build the models, interact with the sensors and check the correlation between the theoretical models and the practical results.

In this paper, a new low-cost, user friendly robotic system has been developed. This system provides an advanced mobile robotics teaching frame using cheap hardware and software resources. This platform consists on a little mobile robot able to navigate through the environment avoiding obstacles and performing a map of its surrounding. This system performs these tasks using open hardware and software tools. The robot, made from an Arduino board, cheap sensors, motors and wheels, has been programmed using C++ language on Arduino and ROS. The system communicates in real time with a PC where the map is drawn using OpenCV libraries. Regarding to the hardware, the robot has the structure of a PopBot-168 Arduino kit, which consists of a circular structure and two motors connected to their corresponding wheels. The robot also has two encoders and a magnetometer to perform location task. The processor is an Arduino Mega board. The system features two infrared sensors that get the distances of robot's environment in every directions due to a servomotor that moves them. The developed robot is able to perform a map of its environment and draw it in a computer. The communication between the robot and the computer is performed using ROS. This project has managed to introduce a ROS node on the Arduino board. In the computer there are another two nodes, one for draw the map and another which decide where to move. Finally, as experimental results, an example of how the robot works building a 2-dimensional reconstruction from an environment is shown. Students can learn about the problem of auto-location and other difficulties due to robotics itself. It is also a very good mechanism to learn from the beginning to design, assemble and program a mobile robot; use and gather data from the sensors.

Wireless sensor network development boards provide interfaces to hardware, radios, real time operating systems, and routing protocols, allowing quick implementation of ideas. However, the selection of WSN development boards available is limited, and sometimes, depending on the popularity of the platform, support and resources are scarce. In this paper, a development platform design is presented, which employs commonly used and widely supported open source hardware and software. The board is also designed to use standard hardware interfaces to make adding additional sensors an easy task.									7	0	0	0	0	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	1558-058X		978-1-4799-6585-4	IEEE SOUTHEASTCON			2014													2	Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Computer Science; Engineering	BH2QM	WOS:000399128200101					2021-02-18

This phrase by Edgar Willems (1890-1978) serves as a starting point in the design, implementation, tuning and validation of a digital interface for teaching and musical creation with children from 3 years old, visually impaired or affected by Autism Spectrum Disorders. The values of illustrated society advocate the access to knowledge for people on equal conditions. Our own public and private education system is based on the merit declaring the equality of citizens. The main aim of our technological proposal is to demonstrate in the practice that the inclusion of students with visual impairment or autism spectrum disorders in the music room, both in schools and conservatories, is positively feasible through curricular changes and using some resources that optimize the inclusion. And in this process, the teacher is a fundamental key part of the educational inclusion. Teachers should have the tools, based on traditional and new technologies, which will help them facilitate and enhance and improve their task results. The design and operation of the interface, which allows the generation and combination of sounds in real time according to the movements made by the student, is based on an open hardware platform and on an open software development environment. These ensure, from the beginning, a cheap interface and make it available to the educational community a tool that could use and improve, if deemed, its performance according to their own needs.

Pervasive and Physical computing have a great demand in both the market and education. The need for creating interfaces that acquire data from users and their environment, has led to proliferation of interest in ubiquitous computing and more innovative solutions. In this paper, we describe the design and delivery of a training workshop that was developed for academics with Information Technology background; the key objective of this workshop's training, was to introduce them to concepts related to physical computing and spark their interest in broadening the scope of computing background for them and their students. The workshop features the Arduino UNO micro-controller since it is a cross platform, open source, and open hardware. Also, due to the fact it's low-cost, flexibility, and simplicity. The sessions covered topics of how to build a circuit, program an Arduino, demonstrate the (IC)-C-2 protocol and establish a serial communication. Twenty-two participants took part in the workshop sessions and two instructors were involved in running the sessions. Insights obtained from conducting the sessions and feedback from participants are synthesized and discussed. Implications for training related to introducing physical computing to IT contexts of learning are described.

Physical parameters such as soil moisture, temperature and humidity are measured by employing sensors sited across the monitored area. The parametric data is transmitted to the Atmel ATmega328P microcontroller from the sensors using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The cloud performs real time intelligence operations based on periodic sensor inputs obtained from the farm and transmits control commands to the microcontroller. The novelty of the system lies in the use of BLE and in the intelligence provided by the cloud. The physically monitored, as well as virtually obtained parameters, at the cloud level allow intelligent command generation, facilitated by a data exchange system that leverages the existing telecom network prevalent in developing countries. Based on the cloud commands, the ATmega328P microcontroller controls the operation time period of the irrigation system thus conserving both water and energy. The approximate cost of implementing the proof of concept system elaborated in this paper by using off the shelf components at retail price is about USD 16. It is expected that the system cost will further reduce on mass production and commercialization.

A sensor based glove for recognition of the gestures in the American Sign Language (ASL) is the input module to the system. It incorporates resistive flex sensors and contact sensors appropriately positioned to obtain a theoretical efficiency of 96% in character recognition. When the sensors are subjected to change in orientation by the user, the variation in electrical resistance of each of the individual sensors is obtained as the input to an Arduino ATMega328 microcontroller that accurately maps it to the letters of the English alphabet through an efficient algorithm. An elegant methodology that is easy to implement using a microcontroller is employed for the mapping process to minimize the complexity of the system. The paper also presents a detailed study of the efficiency characteristics involved in the construction of the custom-designed flex sensors utilized in the system. The paper outlines the calibration and testing results of the sensors. The highlights of the system are its ergonomic and economical design, portability and intelligent gesture recognition and interpretation ability. The implemented system achieves a practical efficiency of up to 80% of theoretical efficiency. The cost of the system is approximately less than USD 5 at laboratory condition using off the shelf components.

J	Calderon, A; Griffin, J; Zagal, JC				Calderon, Ariel; Griffin, James; Cristobal Zagal, Juan			BeamMaker: an open hardware high-resolution digital fabricator for the masses	RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL			English	Article						Innovation; Manufacturing systems; CAD; Rapid prototypes		Purpose - The democratization of invention is a long lasting desire for the advancement of society. Having access to education and the means of production appears as the major factors for the implementation of this goal. 3D printing is a revolutionary technology that has the potential to bring digital manufacturing to everyone. However, the rise of personal fabrication requires an increase in printing quality, a reduction on machine cost and an increase in knowledge shared by the open hardware community. The purpose of this paper is to explore the development of a new Open Hardware printer project to address these points. Design/methodology/approach - The authors have designed and constructed a low-cost photopolymer-based 3D printer called BeamMaker. The printer is connected to a host computer and a digital-light-processing projector. This work details the design process and how improvements were implemented to reach good printing quality. The authors provide public access to the instructions, software, source code, parts list, user manual and STL and CAD files. Findings - The BeamMaker printer can build objects with a high surface quality that is comparable to the quality obtained by industrial photopolymer-based 3D printers. When testing the ability to print a sample cylinder, the printer shows higher accuracy when compared to other personal 3D printers. These findings are encouraging considering the low cost of the system. Research limitations/implications - The printing failure rate of the system has not been measured to date. The system requires some improvements to produce large objects. Practical implications - The printer cost is just USD380. This is five to eight times less expensive than popular personal 3D printers available today. The cost is 30 times less expensive than a personal photopolymer 3D printer produced by a main commercial company and yet producing results of similar quality. The authors expect good avenues for collaboration from the open-source community to continue improving these systems. Social implications - The high cost of current personal 3D printers prevents users from developing countries from entering into the open hardware trend. A dramatic reduction in printer cost such as that explored in this work might contribute to the real democratization of personal fabrication. Originality/value - The authors report on the status of three other photopolymer-based personal 3D printer projects. To the best of the authors' knowledge, BeamMaker is the first fully open hardware 3D printer project which uses this technology.

Three-dimensional printing physiology laboratory technology	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-HEART AND CIRCULATORY PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						heart physiology; 3-D printing; open source manufacturing; optical mapping		Since its inception in 19th-century Germany, the physiology laboratory has been a complex and expensive research enterprise involving experts in various fields of science and engineering. Physiology research has been critically dependent on cutting-edge technological support of mechanical, electrical, optical, and more recently computer engineers. Evolution of modern experimental equipment is constrained by lack of direct communication between the physiological community and industry producing this equipment. Fortunately, recent advances in open source technologies, including three-dimensional printing, open source hardware and software, present an exciting opportunity to bring the design and development of research instrumentation to the end user, i.e., life scientists. Here we provide an overview on how to develop customized, cost-effective experimental equipment for physiology laboratories.

Environmental Life Cycle Analysis of Distributed Three-Dimensional Printing and Conventional Manufacturing of Polymer Products	ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING			English	Article						Life cycle analysis; 3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Distributed manufacturing; Desktop manufacturing; RepRap; Open source hardware; Cumulative energy demand	EMISSIONS; REPRAP; CARBON	With the recent development of the RepRap, an open-source self-replicating rapid prototyper, low-cost three-dimensional (3D) printing is now a technically viable form of distributed manufacturing of polymer-based products. However, the aggregate environmental benefits of distributed manufacturing are not clear due to scale reductions and the potential for increases in embodied energy. To quantify the environmental impact of distributed manufacturing using 3D printers, a life cycle analysis was performed on three plastic products. The embodied energy and emissions from conventional large-scale production in low-labor cost countries and shipping are compared to experimental measurements on a RepRap with and without solar photovoltaic (PV) power fabricating products with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA). The results indicate that the cumulative energy demand of manufacturing polymer products can be reduced by 41-64% (55-74% with PV) and concomitant emission reductions using distributed manufacturing with existing low-cost open-source 3D printers when using <25% fill PIA. Less pronounced positive environmental results are observed with ABS, which demands higher temperatures for the print bed and extruder. Overall, the results indicate that distributed manufacturing using open-source 3D printers has the potential to have a lower environmental impact than conventional manufacturing for a variety of products.

High-end print management systems offer integrated credit reception and efficient, parametrized accounting for the use of resources. The usage of printers and photocopy machines is controlled and monitored, and, through the latter, waste elimination is achieved. Print management inherently conforms with the rationale and mentality of green and eco-friendly technologies that also relate with the ethos of the open source movement in IT. One would expect that open source print management solutions would thrive; however, the vast majority of integrated management systems are commercial. There is only a small number of valuable open source print accounting solutions, but there are none that integrate accounting with a form of credit reception. This paper presents the design of an open system that integrates the provision of automated credit reception with accounting services in order to produce an open solution that fully automates the business process of print charging. The objective is to design the necessary automations for credit reception so that it can be realized without any human intervention, to plan the integration with a suitable open print accounting system and to specify any complementary utilities and tools necessary for production installations.

Due to major modifications ASDEX Upgrade is still in operation. Infrastructure like data acquisition, workstations, etc. is being modernized, interfaces like RS-232 are vanishing and new interfaces are being introduced. This leads to the necessity to adapt old hardware. Most of the microcontrollers used in the old hardware do not offer any support of the new interfaces and have to be replaced. A simple and efficient way is to replace them with open hardware microcontroller boards like the Arduino. These boards are based on 8-bit RISC microcontrollers and offer a software development environment with a large number of libraries. In this paper the use of Arduino boards for replacing the position unit, the stub tuner interface and its use controlling a direct digital synthesizer (DDS) with phase control capability are shown.

Here, we propose detectability of scale-freeness as a benchmark to evaluate time-series extraction settings. Scale-freeness, i.e., power-law distribution of node connections, is a fundamental topological property that is highly conserved across biological networks, and as such needs to be manifest within plausible reconstructions of brain connectivity. We demonstrate that scale-free network topology only emerges when adequately fine cortical parcellations are adopted alongside an appropriate correlation threshold, and provide the full design of the first open-source hardware platform to accelerate the calculation of large linear regression arrays.

Life-cycle economic analysis of distributed manufacturing with open-source 3-D printers	MECHATRONICS			English	Article						3-D printing; Distributed manufacturing; Open-source hardware; RepRap; Additive-layer manufacturing; Rapid prototyping	REPRAP	The recent development of open-source 3-D printers makes scaling of distributed additive-based manufacturing of high-value objects technically feasible and offers the potential for widespread proliferation of mechatronics education and participation. These self-replicating rapid prototypers (RepRaps) can manufacture approximately half of their own parts from sequential fused deposition of polymer feedstocks. RepRaps have been demonstrated for conventional prototyping and engineering, customizing scientific equipment, and appropriate technology-related manufacturing for sustainable development. However, in order for this technology to proliferate like 2-D electronic printers have, it must be economically viable for a typical household. This study reports on the life-cycle economic analysis (LCEA) of RepRap technology for an average US household. A new low-cost RepRap is described and the costs of materials and time to construct it are quantified. The economic costs of a selection of 20 open-source printable designs (representing less than 0.02% of those available), are typical of products that a household might purchase, are quantified for print time, energy, and filament consumption and compared to low and high Internet market prices for similar products without shipping costs. The results show that even making the extremely conservative assumption that the household would only use the printer to make the selected 20 products a year the avoided purchase cost savings would range from about $300 to $2000/year. Assuming the 25 h of necessary printing for the selected products is evenly distributed throughout the year these savings provide a simple payback time for the RepRap in 4 months to 2 years and provide an ROI between >200% and >40%. As both upgrades and the components that are most likely to wear out in the RepRap can be printed and thus the lifetime of the distributing manufacturing can be substantially increased the unavoidable conclusion from this study is that the RepRap is an economically attractive investment for the average US household already. It appears clear that as RepRaps improve in reliability, continue to decline in cost and both the number and assumed utility of open-source designs continues growing exponentially, open-source 3-D printers will become a mass-market mechatronic device.

A Handheld Point-of-Care Genomic Diagnostic System	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MEDIATED ISOTHERMAL AMPLIFICATION; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; RAPID DETECTION; GLOBAL HEALTH; MICROSCOPY; LAMP; RESISTANCE; PCR	The rapid detection and identification of infectious disease pathogens is a critical need for healthcare in both developed and developing countries. As we gain more insight into the genomic basis of pathogen infectivity and drug resistance, point-of-care nucleic acid testing will likely become an important tool for global health. In this paper, we present an inexpensive, handheld, battery-powered instrument designed to enable pathogen genotyping in the developing world. Our Microfluidic Biomolecular Amplification Reader (mBAR) represents the convergence of molecular biology, microfluidics, optics, and electronics technology. The mBAR is capable of carrying out isothermal nucleic acid amplification assays with real-time fluorescence readout at a fraction of the cost of conventional benchtop thermocyclers. Additionally, the mBAR features cell phone data connectivity and GPS sample geotagging which can enable epidemiological surveying and remote healthcare delivery. The mBAR controls assay temperature through an integrated resistive heater and monitors real-time fluorescence signals from 60 individual reaction chambers using LEDs and phototransistors. Assays are carried out on PDMS disposable microfluidic cartridges which require no external power for sample loading. We characterize the fluorescence detection limits, heater uniformity, and battery life of the instrument. As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrate the detection of the HIV-1 integrase gene with the mBAR using the Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) assay. Although we focus on the detection of purified DNA here, LAMP has previously been demonstrated with a range of clinical samples, and our eventual goal is to develop a microfluidic device which includes on-chip sample preparation from raw samples. The mBAR is based entirely around open source hardware and software, and in the accompanying online supplement we present a full set of schematics, bill of materials, PCB layouts, CAD drawings, and source code for the mBAR instrument with the goal of spurring further innovation toward low-cost genetic diagnostics.

It is primarily designed to study the dynamics of the upper atmosphere by utilizing transmitters of opportunity as the RF target illuminators. CAPRI is constructed using the open source software-defined radio toolkit, GNU Radio, to meet the signal processing requirements in combination with the open source hardware, Universal Software Radio Peripheral 2, for data acquisition. The resultant system is highly flexible, and we present the details of the design as well as a performance analysis. CAPRI will be deployed in Peru, near the magnetic equator, for long-term operations in the area. FM stations near Lima, Peru, will be utilized with the targets of interest being the equatorial electrojet and the spread F.

J	Valero-Gomez, A; Gonzalez-Gomez, J; Trevino, R				Valero-Gomez, Alberto; Gonzalez-Gomez, Juan; Trevino, Rafael			A new paradigm for open robotics research and education with the C plus plus OOML	AUTONOMOUS ROBOTS			English	Article						3D printers, Mechanical design; Open hardware; Open source; Software development; Object oriented programming; Open robotics		For many years robotics has been benefited from the open source community. Software community projects like Player, Stage, Gazebo, ROS, or OpenCV are present in most robotic applications. In recent years this trend has also been initiated among electronic and mechanical developments (open hardware). The Arduino development platform is a good example of a successful hardware project with a great community of developers and users around it. The apparition of personal 3D printers is bringing the open source philosophy to the fabrication of physical things as well. This new technology is in need of new designing tools to take advantage of it. In this paper we are presenting the C++ Object Oriented Mechanics Library (OOML), a tool to design mechanical components, taking into account the needs and requirements of these emerging technologies. These designs can be easily shared, reused, and modified. The OOML brings together the advantages of (1) modelling things through code, (2) the object oriented programming paradigm, and (3) the power of C++. In the OOML, mechanical parts are described as geometrical combinations of basic primitives. Once a part is defined, fabrication files can be generated in order to print, or mechanize it. Models could also be used for simulation, visualization, structural analysis, etc.	[Valero-Gomez, Alberto; Gonzalez-Gomez, Juan] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Robot Lab, Madrid, Spain; [Trevino, Rafael] Univ Politecn Madrid, Madrid, Spain	Valero-Gomez, A (corresponding author), Univ Carlos III Madrid, Robot Lab, Madrid, Spain.	alberto.valero.gomez@gmail.com	Gonzalez-Gomez, Juan/AAB-3904-2020		Departamento de Ingenieria de Sistemas y Automatica of Universidad Carlos III de Madrid	We would like to acknowledge all the students of Universidad Carlos III de Madrid that have participated in the last 2 years in the courses of "Open robots design, manufacturing, and programming".

A need has been identified for an open-source alternative to commercial PMU devices tailored to the needs of the university researcher and for enabling the development of new synchrophasor instruments from this foundation. OpenPMU achieves this through open-source hardware design specifications and software source code, allowing duplicates of the OpenPMU to be fabricated under open-source licenses. This paper presents the OpenPMU device based on the Labview development environment. The device is performance tested according to the IEEE C37.118.1 standard. Compatibility with the IEEE C37.118.2 messaging format is achieved through middleware which is readily adaptable to other PMU projects or applications. Improvements have been made to the original design to increase its flexibility. A new modularized architecture for the OpenPMU is presented using an open messaging format which the authors propose is adopted as a platform for PMU research.

This paper provides a methodology for applying an open-source approach to design and development of a colorimeter. A 3-D printable, open-source colorimeter utilizing only open-source hardware and software solutions and readily available discrete components is discussed and its performance compared to a commercial portable colorimeter. Performance is evaluated with commercial vials prepared for the closed reflux chemical oxygen demand (COD) method. This approach reduced the cost of reliable closed reflux COD by two orders of magnitude making it an economic alternative for the vast majority of potential users. The open-source colorimeter demonstrated good reproducibility and serves as a platform for further development and derivation of the design for other, similar purposes such as nephelometry. This approach promises unprecedented access to sophisticated instrumentation based on low-cost sensors by those most in need of it, under-developed and developing world laboratories.

Open-Source 3D-Printable Optics Equipment	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SCIENCE	Just as the power of the open-source design paradigm has driven down the cost of software to the point that it is accessible to most People, the rise of open-source hardware is Poised to drive down the cost of doing experimental science to expand access to everyone. To assist in this aim, this paper introduces a library of open-source 3-D-printable optics components. This library operates as a flexible, low-cost public-domain tool set for developing both research and teaching optics hardware. First, the use of parametric open-source designs using an open-source computer aided design package is described to customize the optics hardware for any application. Second, details are provided on the use of open-source 3 D printers (additive layer manufacturing) to fabricate the primary mechanical components, which are then combined to construct complex optics-related devices. Third, the use of the open-source electronics prototyping platform are illustrated as control for optical experimental apparatuses. This study demonstrates an open-source optical library, which significantly reduces the costs associated with much optical equipment, while also enabling relatively easily adapted customizable designs. The cost reductions in general are over 97%, with some components representing only 1% of the current commercial investment for optical products of similar function. The results of this study make its clear that this method of scientific hardware development enables a much broader audience to participate in optical experimentation both as research and teaching platforms than previous proprietary methods.

J	Berdahl, E; Kontogeorgakopoulos, A				Berdahl, Edgar; Kontogeorgakopoulos, Alexandros			The FireFader: Simple, Open-Source, and Reconfigurable Haptic Force Feedback for Musicians	COMPUTER MUSIC JOURNAL			English	Article							SIMULATION; SOUND	The FireFader is a simple haptic force-feedback device that is optimized for introducing musicians to haptics. It is based upon a single-degree-of-freedom potentiometer fader coupled to a DC motor, also known as a "motorized fader." A light is connected in parallel with the motor to help communicate the force's strength visually. The FireFader consists of only open-source hardware and open-source software elements. Consequently, it is relatively easy for users to repurpose it into new projects involving varying kinds and numbers of motors and sensors. An open-source device driver for the FireFader allows it to be linked to a computer via USB so that the computer can perform the feedback control calculations. For example, the computer can simulate the acoustics of a virtual musical instrument to concurrently synthesize sound and calculate the motor force as a function of the fader position. The serial connection over USB increases the latency of the control signal compared to embedded implementations, but the serial connection facilitates easier programming via the computer, and the force feedback can be automatically disabled when the user is not touching the fader. Some new devices derived from the FireFader design are presented.

With the advent of open hardware initiatives, engineers, scientists, hobbyists, and even people with limited electronic skills have been able to tinker with complex electronic systems. Taking advantage of these inexpensive and widely available tools and in the context of an engineering project class for undergraduates, the authors set about building a working radiosonde prototype from the ground up, based on an open hardware platform and easily accessible components. As a result, a fully functional radiosonde has been built that measures, records, and transmits pressure, temperature, humidity, and wind, plus a small camera that stores images on a flash card. A release system was also developed so that the radiosonde can be detached from a balloon upon reaching a certain height, pressure level, or flight time. Once it is released., one can attempt the recovery of the radiosonde with the help of a precalculated trajectory using a numerical mesoscale forecasting model and visualization software. The performance of the sonde Was compared with two commercial radiosondes using climate chambers and two field launches. This paper also discusses some of the more interesting capabilities foreseeable for such a platform: 1) collaboration between meteorology and engineering departments in both education and research, and 2) development of a flexible hardware platform that allows for an effective way to compare different commercially available sensors and to easily integrate new prototype sensors.

Security in GSM, albeit being one of the most important issues, has not yet been scrutinized to a level it deserves owing mainly to the expensive hardware requirements and lack of thorough understanding of GSM protocols in general. This scenario is changing significantly with the growing rate of development of open-source tools, which can serve to harness the RF signaling and enable processing on a general purpose workstation. In this paper, these open-source tools are utilized to study the feasibility of developing a GSM Protocol Analyzer and investigating the theoretical security protocols and procedures through practical implementation of such system.

At the same time there exists no dedicated technique to perform its quality assessment and engineers are forced to rely on subjective figures such as verification test quality metrics or just the size of the diagnostic test. This paper has proposed two new approaches for assessing diagnostic capability of diagnostic tests for automated bug localization. The first approach relies on probabilistic simulation of diagnostic experiments. The second assessment method is based on calculating Hamming distances of the individual sub-tests in the diagnostic test set. The methods are computationally cheap and they provide for a measure of confidence in the localization results and allow estimating impact of the diagnostic test enhancement. The approach is implemented as a part of an open-source hardware design and debugging framework zamiaCAD. Experimental results with an industrial processor design and a set of documented bugs demonstrate feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Both the light intensity and the spectral distribution affect the power produced by a photovoltaic device. Local variations in the solar spectrum (especially compared to the AM1.5 standard) may have important implications for device optimization and energy yield estimation. The spectrometer system, based on an Ocean Optics USB4000 (300-900nm) spectrometer, was designed to increase functionality. Typically systems only record the global horizontal radiation. Our system moves a fiber-optic cable 0-90 degrees and takes measurements in 9 degree increments. Additionally, a shadow band allows measurement of the diffuse component of the radiation at each position. The electronic controls utilize an Arduino UNO microcontroller to synchronizes the movement of two PAP bipolar (stepper) motors with the activation of the spectrometer via an external trigger. The spectrometer was factory calibrated for wavelength and calibrated for absolute irradiance using a Sellarnet SL 1-Cal light source. We present preliminary results from data taken March-June, 2013, and comment on implications for PV devices in Cochabamba.

However, standard Ethernet components require specific modifications and hardware support to provide strict latency guarantees necessary for safety-critical applications. Although this is a well-stated fact, the design of hardware components for real-time communication remains mostly unexplored. This becomes evident from the few solutions reporting prototypes and experimental validation, which hinders the consolidation of Ethernet in real-world distributed applications. This paper presents Atacama, the first open-source framework based on reconfigurable hardware for mixed-criticality communication in multi-segmented Ethernet networks. Atacama uses specialized modules for time-triggered communication of real-time data, which seamlessly integrate with a standard infrastructure using regular best-effort traffic. Atacama enables low and highly predictable communication latency on multi-segmented 1Gbps networks, easy optimization of devices for specific application scenarios, and rapid prototyping of new protocol characteristics. Researchers can use the open-source design to verify our results and build upon the framework, which aims to accelerate the development, validation, and adoption of Ethernet-based solutions in real-time applications.

By bringing much functionality as software, SDR reduces the cost of hardware maintenance and up-gradation. Open source hardware such as USRP (Universal Software Radio Peripheral) and software called GNU Radio-Companion are commonly used to do experiments in SDR. Since the cost of USRP is high, a low cost set up is needed which is affordable by the student community. In this paper a low cost alternative to USRP is proposed using RTL-SDR (Realtek Software Defined Radio) which is only used for reception. For transmitting purpose, a mixer circuit can be used to map the baseband signal to the band that can be received by RTL-SDR on the other end on Linux / Windows platform. Initially, the experiment is done in simulation. After that, it is tested with low cost hardware such as mixer and RTL-SDR. The cost for total transceiver system can be less than USD 100 which is 10 times less than the existing one.	[Sruthi, M. B.; Abirami, M.; Manikkoth, Akhil; Soman, K.

However, commercial 3DP machines are limited as to the use of building material, without voiding the warranty on the machine. At the same time, a rise in domestic rapid prototyping machines is observed, but none of these machines use the 3DP process. Therefore, an open source 3DP machine is designed and built. In this study, the machine is discussed and the first experiments are carried out to create ceramic (alumina and zirconia) membranes with specific physical properties. The purpose for developing this machine was opening up the opportunity to investigate printing ceramic membranes and reactors. Were, contrary to many other applications, maximal compaction of the powder during deposition is not desirable, to maintain an open structure the walls of the printed object. The machine is able to deposit the powder with adjustable bulk density, which is used to alter the properties of the membrane. The design of the printer (drawings, electronic layout, software) is publicly released under an open source license, free for others to adapt, build and use, e.g. in academic research.

In this paper, a low-cost mobile urban environmental monitoring system is proposed using off-the-shelf open source hardware and software. The system can be installed or used in public transport vehicles, particularly in school and college buses in countries like India. A pollution map of local and regional environments can be built from the data acquired, and displayed online leading to increased awareness of urban pollution problems. The system can also be used in situ in school and college buses to educate children and youth on emerging technologies like computer hardware, software, and web technologies.

In recent years optical flow sensors based on computer mouse hardware chips have been shown to perform well on micro air vehicles. Since they require more light than present in typical indoor and outdoor low-light conditions, their practical use is limited. We present an open source and open hardware design (1) of an optical flow sensor based on a machine vision CMOS image sensor for indoor and outdoor applications with very high light sensitivity. Optical flow is estimated on an ARM Cortex M4 microcontroller in real-time at 250 Hz update rate. Angular rate compensation with a gyroscope and distance scaling using a ultrasonic sensor are performed onboard. The system is designed for further extension and adaption and shown in-flight on a micro air vehicle.

The algorithm is developed based on PX4FLOW platform which is an open software and open hardware solution for monocular speed estimation. The paper provides three main contributions. The first is the improved robustness achieved by various methods including feature block selection, feed-forward rotation, motion compensation, failure case detection and filtering. The second contribution is the improved performance in terms of resolution and search range achieved by adaptive frame interval and advanced search algorithm. The final contribution is a systematical strategy for parameter selection to fully utilize the hardware resources and optimize the performance in different contexts. The performance was benchmarked against the PX4FLOW and GPS. Results indicated that the proposed algorithm achieved levels of robustness exceeding that of PX4FLOW in measuring velocity. Also, the integrated trajectory agreed with the position calculated by an on-board GPS system.

Under circumstances that a particular commercial subsystem with the exact required specific features is unavailable, the realization of such a prototype can be delayed. In this paper, an example of rapid prototyping for a dual-channel biosignal data acquisition system based on the open-source concept is described. The selected biosignal is the finger photoplethysmogram. Except for Matlab, all other software components are open-source. The hardware design of the optical sensor utilized to record the signals is also open-source, making the system extremely affordable with the advantage of flexibility and customization. Precise timing of the samples allows for proper alignment and delay estimation between the acquired traces, useful in arterial stiffness studies. Although the results presented concern only two channels, the system has the ability to be expanded to six channels. Further possible expansions include the addition of custom filtering, on-board data compression and advanced GUI.

By using load disaggregation intelligence, c-meter is the realization of demand response and other smart grid energy conservation initiatives. Our c-meter is made of two key components: a prototype open source ammeter and an optimized embedded load disaggregation algorithm (mu Disagg). Additionally, we provide an open source multi-circuit ammeter array that can build probabilistic appliance (or load) consumption models that are used by the c-meter. mu Disagg is the first load disaggregation algorithm to be implemented on an inexpensive low-power embedded processor that runs in real-time using a typical/basic smart meter measurement (current, in A). mu Disagg can disaggregate loads with complex power states with a high degree of accuracy.

In this system, a set of more relatively general-used motion-level robot language has been designed. The structure of the software has been designed in using of object-oriented programming and the functions of the software have also been modularized to facilitate function extending. Implementation strategy of the interpreting part has been also designed in using of chain of responsibility pattern. Thus, the compiling and interpreting system becomes fully open-ended. The software which is constructed by the system has been demonstrated on Visual Studio 2008 platform, the experimental results indicate that the robot can move accurately under the control of the software and the functions of the software can be extended conveniently, thereby proves the compiling and interpreting system to be a suitable and effective method.

A Low-Cost Open-Source Metal 3-D Printer	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						3-D printing; additive manufacturing; distributed manufacturing; metal processing; MIG welding; open-source; open-source electronics; open-source hardware; personal fabrication; printing; rapid prototyping; scientific hardware; scientific instruments		Technical progress in the open-source self replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) community has enabled a distributed form of additive manufacturing to expand rapidly using polymer-based materials. However, the lack of an open-source metal alternative and the high capital costs and slow throughput of proprietary commercialized metal 3-D printers has severely restricted their deployment. The applications of commercialized metal 3-D printers are limited to only rapid prototyping and expensive finished products. This severely restricts the access of the technology for small and medium enterprises, the developing world and for use in laboratories. This paper reports on the development of a <$2000 open-source metal 3-D printer. The metal 3-D printer is controlled with an open-source micro-controller and is a combination of a low-cost commercial gas-metal arc welder and a derivative of the Rostock, a deltabot RepRap. The bill of materials, electrical and mechanical design schematics, and basic construction and operating procedures are provided. A preliminary technical analysis of the properties of the 3-D printer and the resultant steel products are performed. The results of printing customized functional metal parts are discussed and conclusions are drawn about the potential for the technology and the future work necessary for the mass distribution of this technology.

The initial work done by ICFOSS for soil and atmosphere monitoring sensor networks, where the sensors had wired connections within each node, had limited their deployment to very short distances around the node. A hybrid approach using a mesh network consisting of 'motes'-based sensors is proposed in conjunction with the Raspberry Pi-based management layer to un-tether the sensors, leading to simplified field-based deployments. This approach enables multiple applications such as remote monitoring for disaster management, precision agriculture, wildlife monitoring or pollution monitoring in urban areas.

Urban air pollution is on course to become the top environmental cause of mortality by 2050 - greater than the effects of dirty water and lack of sanitation. This risk is especially high in developing countries, where it is often difficult or expensive to obtain air quality data. This paper outlines the initial development of a system for mapping crowd-sourced air quality data in urban environments in developing countries. This system includes a (1) low cost wearable air quality monitor and (2) a mapping and data visualization web application for use in urban settings in developing countries. Based on open source hardware and software, the air quality monitor is composed of an Arduino microcontroller and sensor shields and collects real-time geographically explicit air quality data, with data storage on removable memory. The mapping and data visualization web application uses javascript functions and Google Maps API to visualize the paths travelled and the intensity of ozone and particulate matter as a heat map.

Often, the price of these robots prohibits using more than a handful. A lot of the commercial robots do not possess all the necessary features to perform specific HRI experiments and due to the closed nature of the platform, large modifications are nearly impossible. While open source social robots do exist, they often use high-end components and expensive manufacturing techniques, making them unsuitable for easy reproduction. To address this problem, a new social robotics platform, named Ono, was developed. The design is based on the DIY mindset of the maker movement, using off-the-shelf components and more accessible rapid prototyping and manufacturing techniques. The modular structure of the robot makes it easy to adapt to the needs of the experiment and by embracing the open source mentality, the robot can be easily reproduced or further developed by a community of users. The low cost, open nature and DIY friendliness of the robot make it an ideal candidate for HRI studies that require a large user group.

We designed a position-independent differencing algorithm to robustly handle language constructs whose relative orderings do not matter. This paper presents Vdiff, an instantiation of this position-independent differencing algorithm for Verilog HDL. To help programmers reason about the differences at a high-level, Vdiff outputs syntactic differences in terms of Verilog-specific change types. The quantitative evaluation of Vdiff on two open source hardware design projects shows that Vdiff is very accurate, with overall 96.8 % precision and 97.3 % recall when using manually classified differences as a basis of comparison. Vdiff is also fast and scalable-it processes the entire revision history of nine open projects all under 5.35 minutes. We conducted a user study with eight hardware design experts to understand how the program differences identified by the experts match Vdiff's output. The study results show that Vdiff's output is better aligned with the experts' classification of Verilog changes than an existing textual program differencing tool.

J	Powell, A				Powell, Alison			Democratizing production through open source knowledge: from open software to open hardware	MEDIA CULTURE & SOCIETY			English	Article						democratic media production; design; knowledge exchange; monopolies of knowledge; open source cultures; political economy		The commercial success of open source software, along with a broader socio-cultural shift towards participation in media and cultural production, have inspired attempts to extend and expand open source practices. These include expansions from software into general culture through 'Free Culture' movements and, more recently, expansions from software into hardware and design. This article provides a critical perspective on the democratic potential of these broader 'open' contribution structures by examining how open source contributions to both software and hardware increase the opportunities for democratic participation in production, governance and knowledge exchange. By analysing attempts to 'open source' the sharing of hardware designs, it also notes the limitations of this democratization. The insights developed in the article nuance the relationship between open source cultures and commercial and market structures, identifying how the generative opportunities created by certain aspects of open source contribution structures increase the potential for democratizing production of communication tools, but also how incongruities across different open-source cultures and communities of practice limit the democratic potential of these processes.

MKIDs feature intrinsic frequency domain multiplexing (FDM) at microwave frequencies, allowing the construction and readout of large arrays. Due to the microwave FDM, MKIDs do not require the complex cryogenic multiplexing electronics used for similar detectors, such as transition edge sensors, but instead transfer this complexity to room temperature electronics where they present a formidable signal processing challenge. In this paper, we describe the first successful effort to build a readout for a photon counting optical/near-IR astronomical instrument, the ARray Camera for Optical to Near-infrared Spectrophotometry. This readout is based on open source hardware developed by the Collaboration for Astronomy Signal Processing and Electronics Research. Designed principally for radio telescope backends, it is flexible enough to be used for a variety of signal processing applications. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

While several protocols nowadays allow wired local network streaming, much effort is still required to achieve similar goals over existing wireless LAN technologies. While the challenge is still far from being solved, several design issues can be highlighted and future scenarios can be outlined. This paper proposes the setup of a wireless music production system based on open hardware and open software which requires relatively low setup effort while allowing for a high flexibility of use. The hardware platform is the Beagleboard, based on Texas Instruments DM3730, running a GNU/Linux OS and the computer music language Pure Data. Such a device can capture electric instrument audio, generate sound, send MIDI or OSC control data, and stream to PCs and other embedded devices operating as mixers, effect racks and so on, enabling an ecosystem of flexible and open devices. Tests conducted on a home wireless network show acceptable latency for many applications.

Indeed current software solutions to the problem, even promising from the point of view of detection and false alarm rates, suffer from the inability of performing the required operations in real time, when working in high speed backbone networks. On the other hand, hardware solutions are based on costly and inflexible niche systems. To address such issues, in this paper, we propose a system based on a the implementation of a "classical" CUSUM-based anomaly detection method on an open networking platform accelerator (i.e., NetFPGA). The objective is to combine the high performance of a hardware oriented solution with the flexibility of general purpose PCs. The experimental results, shown in the paper, clearly demonstrate that the proposed system is able to overcome the current software implementations and to operate in high-speed backbone networks.

The newest tools for those tasks are the unmanned systems, especially the aerial systems. The author built and developed a small and low-cost aerial surveying system, which fundamentally was based on a commercial model airplane and open-source hardware/firmware. The adaptation of these latter components allowed the semi-automatic or automatic stabilization and navigation of the airplane along a trajectory during surveying flights. The current used camera system is a small compact digital camera, which provides digital photographs with true-colour palette. During the flights, the camera was triggered automatically regarding to the requirements of the survey. With this configuration, very-high resolution photo mosaics were taken during several survey projects. This paper introduces the structure of the represented aerial system, especially the open-source autopilot system and some results.

Using printbots (open-source 3D-printable robots) as a starting point in our designs has allowed us to create custom robots with very little effort. Using this new methodology we have designed the ArduSkybot, a robot that has enough features for its usage at different educational levels while keeping a very reduced cost. The robot is based on Arduino and the Printshield, our new electronics platform. It provides integration of various sensors (light, distance and line sensors) and actuators (motors, lights and speaker). It is also easy to expand by students and researchers. We describe our designs, and document their performance in various workshops with college, primary and secondary students. Our methodology is described and suggestions are given regarding future printbot-based workshops.

LEARNING MATHEMATICAL CONCEPTS WITH 3D ANIMATION: ACTIVE VISUALIZATION OF A QUATERNION	5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND INNOVATION (ICERI 2012)			English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation (ICERI)	NOV 19-21, 2012	Madrid, SPAIN			Animation; digital arts; interactive; open hardware; open source		The aim of this work is to present an active and creative visualization method for mathematical concepts using 3D animation, modeling, simulation and story. The result is a first-hand experience of practical problems that need solutions. The method attempts to motivate investigation and problem solving by inviting the student to experience the problem itself through a creative activity. Although classic visualization models in mathematics involve three dimensional renderings and interactive animations and have proven to be effective in many situations, often they break down concepts into new concepts and then present segments to the observer. Most interactive models are predefined, driven by limited parameters that are available as a user interface. Many times we can see students wanting to use their creativity to interact instead of becoming the passive observer or operator. The active visualization method employs a measurable virtual 3D world with a time-line, a modeling tool-set and a physics simulation engine inside a common 3D animation package. The animation process strictly relies on segments controlled by non-linear function curves locked to time and therefore it provides an excellent ground to manipulate transformations without limitations even when those lead to problems. Students will engage in a creative activity that involves a story with a given goal by modeling and animating a phenomenon or group of phenomena that will lead to a problem they do not expect. The students will learn about a mathematical concept that provides the solution to their problem. They will integrate the concept and fix the problem to complete the story. Although there is a large number of topics and many levels of complexity where the method can be used at, for example modeling geometries to calculate volume or grouping large amounts of particles based on certain attributes, one of the most important elements is the storytelling that connects all participants. This work presents an example of using quaternion to adjust the rotation of a spaceship to change trajectory in order to fly back to the Earth. The spaceship will be driven to a gimbal lock in Euler angles.

We present a novel mechanism that, for the first time, equips a fiber-fed spectrograph with multiple discreet slits of different widths. In this paper, we detail the mechanical design of our variable slit mechanism, which is capable of positioning any one of six slits in front of the fibers immediately prior to injection into the spectrograph's optical train. Further, we present the details of related system necessary to achieve closed loop positioning of the slit mechanism given that no encoder is used. We also briefly discuss our use of open source and open hardware projects in the design. Finally, we describe the control system we have implemented for this subsystem.

In this paper, the system, field measurements and potential applications will be described. As will the science drivers of having full control and open access to a measurement system in an age when commercial solutions have become popular but are restrictive in terms of proprietary sensor specifications, "black-box" calibration operations or data handling routines, etc. The ability to modify and experiment with both the hardware and software tools is an essential part of the scientific process.

They are often accompanied by open source software. This can bring reliability, ease of debugging, and modular development for rapid prototyping using pre-written libraries. Merits of using open source hardware are discussed and then applied to a portable sensor system based on the open hardware Arduino-derived Jeenode microcontroller board. The system uses an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and seamless integration of other sensors, including a piezo-resistive pressure sensor. It is shown that open source hardware can help to increase rapid development, reduce costs, and encourage further development.

Control messages are sent over Wi-Fi network from a Wi-Fi device to the micro-controller which then couples the messages to the power lines. Ubiquitous power lines are used as physical media to transmit data over 220V/50Hz signal to control appliances/equipment. The data from the microcontroller is coupled onto the power lines using a PLC (Power Line Communication) modem and DCSK (Differential Code Shift Keying) modulation technique is employed to transmit data. Each receiver unit consists of PLC modem plus microcontroller and can be connected anywhere in the power line network. The receivers have addresses assigned to them and only respond to the commands sent to them by the transmitter PLC modem. The receiver unit controls the flow of electricity to the socket. The entire system is devoid of a computer to save power and make it low cost. Use of open source hardware, Power Line Communication and micro-controller collectively reduce the cost of controlling appliances remotely.

They are able to fulfill multiple purposes, ranging from energy saving or location based reminders to burglary detection. Particularly useful are combined systems that include localization, as well as additional services e.g. fall detection. Capacitive sensing systems that allow detecting the presence of a body over distance are a possible solution for indoor localization that has been used in the past. However usually the installation requirements are high and consequently they are expensive to integrate. We propose a flexible, integrated solution based on affordable, open-source hardware that allows indoor localization and fall detection specifically designed for challenges in the context of AAL. The system is composed of sensing mats that can be placed under various types of floor covering that wirelessly transmit data to a central platform providing localization and fall detection services to connected AAL platforms. The system was evaluated noncompetitive in the 2011 EvAAL indoor localization competition.

Yet the role of domestic spaces in shaping lived experience within the urban environment, and subsequent technological interventions, is often overlooked. Homes are framed as closed-off environments which isolate their inhabitants from the city, despite being porous spaces that are also filled with ubiquitous computing. In this paper we draw on the participatory design and user innovation literatures to present the methodology for the "Homesense" research project that explored how users design and develop "smart" technologies within their own homes, based on the intersection of their concurrent urban/domestic lived experience. Kits of open-source hardware were used as cultural probes, and co-located "lead users" provided technical expertise. This methodology demonstrates the importance of physical space and location in user-led domestic activities, and of combinations of technical and "lived" expertise in developing these interventions.

J	Lattanzi, E; Bogliolo, A				Lattanzi, Emanuele; Bogliolo, Alessandro			VirtualSense: A Java-Based Open Platform for Ultra-Low-Power Wireless Sensor Nodes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Article								Idleness has to be carefully exploited in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to save power and to accumulate the energy possibly harvested from the environment. State-of-the-art microcontroller units provide a wide range of ultra-low-power inactive modes with sub-millisecond wakeup time that can be effectively used for this purpose. At the same time they are equipped with 16-bit RISC architectures clocked at tens of MHz, which make them powerful enough to run a Java-compatible virtual machine (VM). This makes it possible to bring the benefits of a virtual runtime environment into power-constrained embedded systems. VMs, however, risk to impair the effectiveness of dynamic power management as they are seen as always-active processes by the scheduler of the operating system in spite of the idleness of the threads running on top of them. Avoiding to keep sensor nodes busy when they could be idle is mandatory for the energetic sustainability of WSNs. While most of the tasks of a sensor node are inherently event-driven, the functioning of its hardware-software components is not, so that they require to be redesigned in order to exploit idleness. This paper presents VirtualSense, an open-hardware open-source ultra-low-power reactive wireless sensor module featuring a Java-compatible VM.

This paper is to propose an architecture of intelligent controller via multi-agent-based conceptual as the reference architecture. It can be successfully used to create an open CNC on ISO standard of ISO 14649 and ISO 10303. This offers interoperability, portability, and adaptability. The proposed framework consists of four main modules, STEP-NC interface, simulator, data warehouse, and communication. In order to optimize, the controller should incorporate with various technology related to intelligent, such as kernel software, open communication port and open hardware design. The architecture will be implemented in CNC controller and to be tested later on actual milling machine. It will simplify the design of CNC machine controller with the architecture layers responsible for data processing, data storage, execution and feedback. This paper will discuss order towards the requirements for global interoperable manufacturing for real-life machining system.	[Elias, D.

The developed Programmable Analog Computer/Controller (PAC) is an open hardware for a wide range of signal processing tasks. In this report the analog signal routing and filter based signal processing realized by the dpASP is presented. This research was focused on the signals form as they are processed and transferred between analog processors. The investigation is exampled by the low-pass filter(s) embedded into every analog processor. For complex signal processing tasks a few dpASP must be routed together. The dpASP chain is created for signal diagnosis and due to the limited resources of a single device. Final conclusions related to chaining analog processors are given.

All prototypes have been based on the unique lift type blade system consisting of sailcloth material which allows for the turbine to operate with variable blade pitch and profile camber. The latest prototype is presented along with a detailed discussion of fundamental design aspects such as the sail blades, frame tower, alternator, and transmission systems. The VosREC headquarters for research, development and testing is located in a remote, rural, and non-electrified village in Nicaragua. This location provides researchers with the unique opportunity to experience and observe first-hand how renewable energy technologies can be applied to improve quality of life for people living without connection to national electricity grids. Aspects and benefits of the "open source hardware" approach are presented along with a discussion on implementation models, "bottom-up", empowerment and self-organization.

The system is composed of a control center (CC) and a set of remote terminal units (RTUs); the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 60870-5 series has been chosen for communication among them. This is a standard protocol of real-time telecontrol applications. The CC is a personal computer, and the RTUs are based on open hardware and software. The RTU hardware is an embedded system, i.e., a system-on-chip-type design using field-programmable gate array that has been programmed with the open-core LEON running Linux operating system. For prototyping, the GR-XC3S-1500 board has been used. As there is no open source code available for the IEC standard protocols, an open source code has also been implemented. Hence, both the hardware and the software are open source in OFESAPO. Several tests have been made to show the system's limitations and the suitability for real-time applications. A prototype has also been tested in a real environment, where the real position of two moving RTUs was shown by a CC using Google Map.

CheapStat: An Open-Source, "Do-It-Yourself" Potentiostat for Analytical and Educational Applications	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SHRINKY-DINK MICROFLUIDICS; ELECTROCHEMICAL DETECTION; DRINKING-WATER; DNA; VOLTAMMETRY; GENERATION; DESIGN	Although potentiostats are the foundation of modern electrochemical research, they have seen relatively little application in resource poor settings, such as undergraduate laboratory courses and the developing world. One reason for the low penetration of potentiostats is their cost, as even the least expensive commercially available laboratory potentiostats sell for more than one thousand dollars. An inexpensive electrochemical workstation could thus prove useful in educational labs, and increase access to electrochemistry-based analytical techniques for food, drug and environmental monitoring. With these motivations in mind, we describe here the CheapStat, an inexpensive (<$80), open-source (software and hardware), hand-held potentiostat that can be constructed by anyone who is proficient at assembling circuits. This device supports a number of potential waveforms necessary to perform cyclic, square wave, linear sweep and anodic stripping voltammetry. As we demonstrate, it is suitable for a wide range of applications ranging from food-and drug-quality testing to environmental monitoring, rapid DNA detection, and educational exercises. The device's schematics, parts lists, circuit board layout files, sample experiments, and detailed assembly instructions are available in the supporting information and are released under an open hardware license.

Open-hardware e-puck Linux extension board for experimental swarm robotics research	MICROPROCESSORS AND MICROSYSTEMS			English	Article						Swarm robotics; Mobile robotics; Embedded Linux		In this paper we describe the implementation of a Linux extension board for the e-puck educational mobile robot, designed to enhance the computation, memory and networking performance of the robot at very low cost. The extension board is based on a 32-bit ARM9 microprocessor and provides wireless network support. The ARM9 extension board runs in parallel with the dsPIC microprocessor on the e-puck motherboard with communication between the two via an SPI bus. The extension board is designed to handle computationally intensive image processing, wireless communication and high-level intelligent robot control algorithms, while the dsPIC handles low-level sensor interfacing, data processing and motor control. The extension board runs an embedded Linux operating system, along with a Debian-based port of the root file system stored in a Micro SD card. The extended e-puck robot platform requires minimal effort to integrate the well-known open-source robot control framework Player and, when placed within a TCP/IP networked infrastructure, provides a powerful and flexible platform for experimental swarm robotics research.

We present Fab FM, an open-source FM radio that integrates an electronic circuit board, laser-cut wood, and fabric. We describe a workshop in which participants designed and built their own Fab FM variants, modifying the form, materials, and behavior of the radio. Drawing from this experience, we discuss three themes: the issues involved in working across design domains, the ways in which design can serve as source code, and the difference between open-source and hackable. We present potential business models for Fab FM, and discuss the possibilities that digital fabrication offers for a more diverse landscape of high-tech products.

Rapid Single-Chip Secure Processor Prototyping on the OpenSPARC FPGA Platform	2011 22ND IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON RAPID SYSTEM PROTOTYPING (RSP)	IEEE International Symposium on Rapid System Prototyping		English	Proceedings Paper	22nd IEEE International Symposium on Rapid System Prototyping (RSP)	MAY 24-27, 2011	Karlsruhe, GERMANY	IEEE, IEEE Reliabil Soc, Karlsruhe Inst Technol (KIT)				Secure processors have become increasingly important for trustworthy computing as security breaches escalate. By providing hardware-level protection, a secure processor ensures a safe computing environment where confidential data and applications can be protected against both hardware and software attacks. In this paper, we present a single-chip secure processor model and demonstrate rapid prototyping of the secure processor on the OpenSPARC FPGA platform. OpenSPARC T1 is an industry-grade, open-source, FPGA-synthesizable general-purpose microprocessor originally developed by Sun Microsystems, now acquired by Oracle. It is a multi-core, multi-threaded 64-bit processor with open-source hardware, including the microprocessor core, as well as system software that can be freely modified by researchers. We modify the OpenSPARC T1 processor by adding security modules: an AES engine, a TRNG and a memory integrity tree. These enhancements enable security features like memory encryption and memory integrity verification. By prototyping this single-chip secure processor on the FPGA platform, we find that the OpenSPARC T1 FPGA platform has many advantages for secure processor research. Our prototyping demonstrates that additional modules can be added quickly and easily and they add little resource overhead to the base OpenSPARC processor.	[Zhang, Wei; Chan, King; Li, Will X.

STORYTELLING WITH OPEN HARDWARE: INTERACTIVE ANIMATION LEARNING FRAMEWORK	2011 4TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND INNOVATION (ICERI)			English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation (ICERI)	NOV 14-16, 2011	Madrid, SPAIN			Animation; digital arts; interactive; open hardware; open source		Based on previous classical learning models created for animation and digital artists, this work presents a framework that stimulates creativity by divergent thinking without compromising technology and specialization. The classical learning model focuses on specialization by utilizing dedicated technologies and devices. Although this approach has proven to be successful in the past because it is highly skill oriented, it promotes directive teaching practice through mainly audio-visual content. Even though the technology is specialized, it is also limited and because of the empirical nature of the process the artists develop linear, sometimes even convergent thinking. Open hardware technologies provide first-hand fabrication experience in a workshop environment embracing interdisciplinary collaboration and information sharing. The aesthetic experience is perceived through vision, sound, smell and touch while the interactive experience is created by sensors, micro-controllers, kinetic sculptures, puppets and installations connected to virtual 3D worlds. This kind of learning environment in conjunction with the emotional interest enhances the capacity to achieve original content and ideas that have value, while the divergent thinking helps to find solutions in various areas and industries.

But even those teachers who want to innovate experience many obstacles. On one hand, the difficulties they have to use certain technologies and on the other hand the difficulties faced by schools to invest in acquiring the necessary equipment. Teachers need to be created facilitating conditions for technology upgrades, to help them reach a personal motivation level for its use. To resolve the second difficulty it must be created an awareness that there are already several alternatives, including the use of open hardware and electronic equipment at low cost, combined with the use of free software.

Design of an Electronic Instrumentation Virtual Laboratory based on Free-Open Resources	2011 6TH COLOMBIAN COMPUTING CONGRESS (CCC)	Computing Colombian Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	6th Colombian Computing Congress (CCC)	MAY 04-06, 2011	Manizales, COLOMBIA			Electronic Instrumentation; e-Learning; Free-Open Resources; Virtual Laboratory	CONTROL-SYSTEMS; SUPPORT	Increasing cross-influence of technology on education and modern pedagogical approaches, could be integrated to act as an academic whole in the universities for the improvement of teaching-learning processes. By means of virtual laboratories, teachers and students can use technological means and web infrastructure to overcome classroom and laboratory limitations in equipment, personnel and space, additionally, by the guidance of correct pedagogical strategies, they can fulfill requirements of the education process not fully covered at classroom, during course time. Through proper design considerations, the operation of a virtual laboratory can be based on open-free hardware and software resources currently being used worldwide and widely known, available without any cost. A structural framework for the implementation of a virtual laboratory on electronic instrumentation to be supported on free open resources is proposed. The proposed framework shows major economic advantages over other virtual laboratories based on commercial solutions; budget constraints due to high investments in license and proprietary hardware purchases are reduced. Long term sustainability is favored because of the growing worldwide efforts and communities continuously providing support, sharing resources and developing new materials related with the project.

Energy storage is a critical technology for electric vehicles and to some extent for intermittent renewable energy sources. Battery life, performance, and cost remain a barrier to widespread use of battery energy storage. Increasing the number of students researching these technologies would increase the likelihood of progress. The process of testing batteries to characterize performance and durability typically requires the use of specialized equipment that may be beyond the budget for many educators. Hence, many interested students may not have access to the tools to perform these experiments. To remedy this, we have begun the development of an open source battery-testing platform that can be built at a fraction of the cost of commercial systems. Furthermore, the development of the testing platform provides educational opportunities for students.

The student team was composed of seven students within an aeronautical concentration of their Mechanical Engineering Technology program. The students designed and built a UAV capable of flying under direct manual control and indirect automatic control. Direct manual control was accomplished via a model radio-control transmitter, while indirect control accomplished via the onboard autopilot system. Programmable autonomous flight software, utilizing global positioning satellites (GPS), controls the autopilot system. A ground control station (GCS) sends and receives telemetry from a 2.4GHz modem located in the UAV. The GCS utilized Paparazzi, an open-source hardware and software autopilot platform, which allows mission specific flight plans to be created, uploaded, and executed and monitored during the UAV's flight. Real-time video from the UAV is transmitted to the GCS via an antenna and receiver. This comprehensive design and build project, concluding with successful test flights, enhanced the student learning and performance during the course of the project. Assessment data gathered by the project faculty mentor are provided in the paper.

Two demos using SensLAB: Very Large Scale Open WSN Testbed	2011 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING IN SENSOR SYSTEMS AND WORKSHOPS (DCOSS)			English	Proceedings Paper	7th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems (DCOSS)	JUN 27-29, 2011	Barcelona, SPAIN	IEEE, Ctr Tecnologic Telecomunicacions Catalunya (CTTC), IEEE Comp Soc Tech Comm Parallel Proc (TCPP), IEEE Comp Soc Tech Comm Distributed Proc (TCDP)				We present SensLAB, a very large scale wireless sensor network testbed(1). SensLAB is distributed among 4 sites having different topologies and consists of 1024 wireless nodes based on open source hardware & software. Within a given site, each one of the 256 nodes is able to communicate via its radio interface (868Mhz or 2.4Ghz) to its neighbors. Furthermore, every sensor node is potentially configurable as a sink node and can exchange data with any other sink node of the whole SensLAB testbed and/or Internet application. The testbed is designed to achieve reproducibility of experimentation, while also supporting evaluation of protocols and applications in real world settings. It allows to monitor transparently, i.e., without any insertion/modification within the code, any deployed application in terms of energy consumption or radio activity. The main benefits of SensLAB for the users are to reduce the costs in terms of: infrastructure investment, maintenance cost and operating cost. With SensLAB you can be up and running minutes after you are assigned an account! SensLAB's main and most important goal is to offer an accurate open access multi-users scientific tool to support the design, development, tuning, and experimentation of real large-scale sensor network applications. During this demo, we propose to demonstrate the interests of the SensLAB testbed by developing and running two experimental scenarii that highlight the services offered by SensLAB.

In order to efficiently process network traffic, it is necessary to dynamically split high-speed packet streams across cores based on the monitoring goal. Most network adapters are multi-core aware but offer limited facilities for assigning packets to processor cores. In this paper we introduce a hybrid traffic analysis framework that leverages flexible packet balancing mechanisms available on recent 10 Gbit commodity network adapters not yet exploited by operating systems. The main contribution of this paper is an open source hardware-assisted software layer for dynamically configuring packet balancing policies in order to fully exploit multi-core systems and enable 10 Gbit wire-speed network traffic analysis.

State of the art autonomous systems are however geared towards the application area in safe and obstacle-free altitudes greater than 30 meters. Applications at lower altitudes still require a human pilot. A new application field will be the reconstruction of structures and buildings, including the facades and roofs, with semi-autonomous MAVs. Ongoing research in the MAV robotics field is focusing on enabling this system class to operate at lower altitudes in proximity to nearby obstacles and humans. PIXHAWK is an open source and open hardware toolkit for this purpose. The quadrotor design is optimized for onboard computer vision and can connect up to four cameras to its onboard computer. The validity of the system design is shown with a fully autonomous capture flight along a building.

A simple and low-cost solution was developed to build an autonomous aerial surveying airplane, which can fulfil the necessities ( aerial photographs with very-high resolution) of other departments at the university and very useful and practical for teaching photogrammetry. The base was a commercial, remote controlled model airplane and an open-source GPS/IMU system (MatrixPilot) was adapted to achieve the semi-automatic or automatic stabilization and navigation of the model airplane along predefined trajectory. The firmware is completely open-source and easily available on the website of the project. The first used camera system was a low-budget, low-quality video camera, which could provide only 1.2 megapixel photographs or low resolution video depending on the light conditions and the desired spatial resolution. A field measurement test was carried out with the described system: the aerial surveying of an undiscovered archaeological site, signed by a crop-mark in mountain Pilis (Hungary).

We argue that produsage is not a model that determines a change in the traditional consumption/production paradigm through a series of essential preconditions (such as open participation, peer-sharing, or common ownership). Rather, we explain produsage as the open-ended result of a series of heterogeneous actor-networking strategies. In this view, the so-called preconditions do not explain produsage but have to be explained along with its establishment as an actor-network. Drawing on this approach, we discuss a case study of an open hardware project: the Arduino board, and we develop a perspective that maps the skills of human and non-human entities in produsage actor-networks, showing how skills are symmetrical, relational, and circulating.

Recently telecom industry came up with a great open hardware specification - Advanced Telecom Computing Architecture (ATCA). This specification is aimed for better reliability, availability and serviceability. Since its first market appearance in 2004. ATCA platform has shown tremendous growth and proved to be stable and well represented by a number of vendors. ATCA is an industry standard for highly available systems. On the other hand Service Availability Forum, a consortium of leading communications and computing companies, describes interaction between hardware and software. SAF defines a set of specifications such as Hardware Platform Interface, Application Interface Specification. SAF specifications provide extensive description of highly available systems, services and their interfaces. Originally aimed for telecom applications, these specifications can be used for accelerator controls software as well. This study describes benefits of using these specifications and their possible adoption to accelerator control systems. It is demonstrated how EPICS Redundant IOC was extended using Hardware Platform Interface specification, which made it possible to utilize benefits of the ATCA platform. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

J	Park, C; Jung, JH; Bae, KH				Park, Changhan; Jung, Jik-Han; Bae, Kyung-Hoon			Robustly Adaptive Moving Thermal Object Segmentation Using Background Modeling Based on Runtime-Weighted Features	JOURNAL OF IMAGING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							SURVEILLANCE; TRACKING; PEOPLE	Moving object segmentation plays an important role in a complex object tracking system. This system decides whether the current block belongs to the object region or not. In this article, a scheme using background modeling based on runtime-weighted features for robustly adaptive moving object segmentation in infrared (IR) image sequence is proposed. Proposed background modeling for an open hardware (H/W) architecture design decreases the size of the search area to construct a sparse block template of search area in infrared images. The authors also compensate for motion compensation when the image moves in previous and current frames of IR imaging system. The method of separation of background and objects applies to adaptive values through time analysis of pixel intensity The proposed method uses more feature information such as intensity, deviation, block matching error, and velocity. The weighting values give a higher weight to feature information which has a large difference between the object and the background region. Based on experimental results, the proposed method showed real-time moving object segmentation through background modeling in the proposed embedded system.

This mod-ule, Alpha Waves Related Potentials - ARP- explains how brain waves are obtained, processed, analyzed and identified depending on their frequency. This module makes use of the Open EEG Project's open hardware monitor for brain wave activity, called the modular EEG. The brain waves are obtained through an electrode cap complying with the international 10-20 system for electrode positioning. The brain waves are processed with a fast Fourier transform using a mi-crocontroller and analyzed in software identifying the alpha wave's contribution. A program identifies the amount of time that alpha wave generation was maintained through concentration, and instructions are sent to the robotic arm, executing one of four pre-defined routines. Thirty percent of the users attained control over the robotic arm with the human computer interface.

Still having excellent simulators of the physical world, working with concrete material allows the development of cognitive structures that digital doesn't offer. Moreover, these didactic resources allow highly participative group dynamics that have not been yet reached by the existing computers at schools. Unfortunately, in our view there are two major difficulties for the presence of these resources in the classroom. The physical technology is expensive and suffers from constant wear. On the other hand, teachers arc not accustomed to working in a dynamic classroom with a methodology of work in a participative group, and have fears about the use of specific technological equipment. Physical Etoys is a development that aims to overcome these difficulties. Physical Etoys facilitates the interaction between inexperienced users and concrete material such as open hardware devices or popular toys by providing a powerful and intuitive visual programming system in order to explore and learn science in an enjoyable way. The objective of this paper is to introduce a new module of Physical Etoys which aims to persuade kids to do different electronic projects with an Arduino Board.

It associates a programmable multi-axis controller (PMAC) as the motion control unit with programmable numerical controllers (PCL-725, PCL-730) for on-off control. To bring about synchronized movements of the main 5-axis tape-laying head system and the 3-axis ultrasonic tape-cutting sub-system, the tracking-control method associated with time-based mode attributed to PMAC is applied in different cases. In addition, with the goal of realizing real-time tasks in the software system such as synchronizing motion control and on-off control, the real-time Win 2000 system is adopted. As a device driver for PMAC and PCL, a user graphical interface and a numerical control program interpretation module are also designed. This system is helpful to solve complicated problems in designing numerical controls for ATL such as ensuring high requirements for precise machine control and synchronization of motion control and on-off control.

Our goal is to eventually create a thriving developer-community, where developers around the world contribute reusable modules and designs for the benefit of the community as a whole. To this end, we have created a repository of "User Contributed Designs" at NetFPGA.org. But creating an "open-source hardware" platform is quite different from software oriented open-source projects. Designing hardware is much more time consuming and more error prone than designing software, and so demands a process that is more focussed on verifying that a module really works as advertised, else others will be reluctant to use it. We have designed a novel process for contributing new designs. Each contributed design is specified entirely by a set of tests it passes. A developer includes a list of tests that their design will pass, along with an executable set of tests that the user can check against. Through this process, we hope to establish the right expectations for someone who reuses a design, and to encourage sound design practices with solid, repeatable and integrated testing. In this paper we describe the philosophy behind our process, in the hope that others may learn from it, as well as describe the details of how someone contributes a new design to the NetFPGA repository.

The idea is to build GSM networks using open-source and open-hardware projects, such as: OpenBTS, Openmoko, IP04, Asterisk and USRP. The NavegaPara Program, which currently connects thirteen cities in the state, provides the backbone network with optical fiber and digital radios. This paper summarizes the project and discusses the strategy adopted to circumvent a specific problem: the establishment of know-how on GSM technologies among engineering (electrical and computer) students. Several hands-on experiments in GSM technologies are being currently used and some are described here. For example, the work discusses how the Matlab toolkit GSMsim can be used to analyze digitized GSM waveforms. It also describes the development of a QAM modulator for better understanding the basics of GNU Radio. The success of the project will be measured by the effect in the life of citizens who, currently, do not have any access to a phone for basic communication needs.

Due primarily to the rapid growth of broadband internet, cheap data storage and fast microchip technology, a new frontier has been opened where engineers and scientists can quickly and efficiently share large amounts of information with colleagues all across the globe. The implications of this technology have been and continue to become increasingly influential on the evolution of not just the sciences, but humanity as a whole. This paper will survey current successes that have been seen in open source software development and the emergent 'open design' realm. From here, parallels are drawn between the two disciplines to illustrate how engineering organizations can benefit from the highly distributed nature that open source software has implemented. In this light, this paper will establish the position that engineering design must make the shift towards a more open and collaborative environment to stay relevant and prosper in the Information Age. Additionally, a basic web framework detailing the technologies needed to see such a shift occur will be outlined. Currently, there is some research being done in this area, but overall the possibilities for growth and innovation are significant.

Facilitated by advances in information technology software and hardware, new ways to disseminate information such as wikis and Internet-enabled mobile phones, the global development of OSAT has emerged as a reality. This paper shows the sharing of design processes, appropriate tools, and technical information is enables more effective and rapid development of appropriate technologies for both industrialized and non-industrialized regions. This sharing will require the appropriate technology community to adopt open standards/licenses, document knowledge, and build on previous work. This paper offers solutions in the form of both business models and tools to overcome technical constraints of OSAT development in the forms of the platforms necessary on which to share and build knowledge about appropriate technologies. These solutions are open, easily accessible for those in need, have a low barrier to entry for both users and information creators, and must be vetted in order to utilized as a trustworthy source on critical information needs. Current progress towards implementing these solutions will be reviewed and recommendations will be made to further increase the rate of OSAT development.

This paper is intended to show how the development of GRA compliant modules advances both new and time-tested technologies through establishing a standard for Above 2 GHz SATCOM Terminal modules. The paper will also describe plans to develop and apply tools, products and solutions to validate the GRA. The paper describes the process associated with engaging industry in developing the GRA. Functional Decomposition, validating the GRA through a prototype, creating the GRA as a standard for the Army HC3 Program, and managing to that architecture and standard in a development environment. The paper also describes how GRA validation through use of DSM tools, such as LATTIX, will aid in the development and testing of a GRA Hardware and Software Interface Test Development Environment designed to allow a GRA module developer to develop, interface, and test interface applications to the GRA compatible open hardware/software interfaces. Full documentation shall be developed for all open hardware and software interfaces, sufficient to develop applications with minimum interface or interaction with the module developer. Interface definition stability over time will be a key factor in the mission success of the HC3 open system interfaces, so they must be designed with stability and longevity in mind. This paper will review alternatives for validation of GRA compliant modules. Particular emphasis will be placed on DSM techniques. The interdependencies between modules will be modeled using a DSM so as to provide a big picture view of GRA. DSM can also be used to model and expose key design decisions for the entire team. Rules can be established in the DSM model for GRA compliance to guide a GRA module developer during development and testing for validation. The use of DSM to model various hardware and software modules in the HBHT will create a common artifact that can be shared across various teams with different skills and domains of expertise. DSM can also be used to analyze the impact of change. Over time, DSM will provide a blue print of the architecture and how it evolves to meet changing needs.									2	0	0	0	0	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA			978-1-4244-5238-5	IEEE MILIT COMMUN C			2009							431	435					5	Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications	Engineering; Telecommunications	BQA52	WOS:000280509900062					2021-02-18

Fast pattern matching algorithm is the key to improve the system performance. In this paper, a fast reverse pattern matching algorithm and the hardware implementation suitable with Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) are proposed. Taking advantage of the parallelism and programmability of FPGA, this design reduces the pattern match delay greatly. This design is implemented in a NetFPGA platform, which is an open hardware platform optimized for high-speed network. The parallel pattern matching system provides a high throughput of 4 Gbps with no data loss, which proves the information processing rate of this design.

Rapidly evolving clinical and scientific requirements have created a need for hardware and software that can be customized for specific applications. Hardware may require customization to enable a variety of recording types (e.g., electroencephalogram, local field potentials, or multi-unit activity) while meeting the stringent and costly requirements of MRI safety and compatibility. Real-time signal processing tools are an enabling technology for studies of learning, attention, sleep, epilepsy, neurofeedback, and neuropharmacology, yet real-time signal processing tools are difficult to develop. We describe an open-source system for simultaneous electrophysiology and fMRI featuring low-noise (< 0.6 mu V p-p input noise), electromagnetic compatibility for MRI (tested up to 7T), and user-programmable real-time signal processing. The hardware distribution provides the complete specifications required to build an MRI-compatible electrophysiological data acquisition system, including circuit schematics, print circuit board (PCB) layouts, Gerber files for PCB fabrication and robotic assembly, a bill of materials with part numbers, data sheets, and vendor information, and test procedures. The software facilitates rapid implementation of real-time signal processing algorithms. This system has been used in human EEG/fMRI studies at 3 and 7T examining the auditory system, visual system, sleep physiology, and anesthesia, as well as in intracranial electrophysiological studies of the non-human primate visual system during 3T fMRI, and in human hyperbaric physiology studies at depths of up to 300 feet below sea level.

The system relies on infrared communications with frequency modulation and is composed of two interconnected modules for data and power measurement. Thanks to the open hardware license under which it is released, the research community can easily replicate the system at a low cost and/or adapt it for applications in sensor networks and in robotics.

Lipopolysaccharide-induced increases in cytokines in discrete mouse brain regions are detectable using Luminex xMAP((R)) technology	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Sleep; Mouse; Multiplex; Interleukin; Tumor necrosis factor; Brain; CNS	BLOOD MONONUCLEAR-CELLS; MULTIPLE CYTOKINES; PROTEIN EXPRESSION; SERUM; MICE; LPS; THERMOREGULATION; BEHAVIOR; INVIVO; PLASMA	Methods to determine cytokine protein content in samples of interest, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), are often labor-intensive and costly. Furthermore, because ELISA requires relatively large sample volumes and protein concentrations, it is difficult using this technique to determine protein content for multiple cytokines from individual samples. Recently, Luminex has developed an open source hardware platform combining flow cytometry- and bead-based antibody capture that is capable of detecting multiple analytes from a single sample. In the present study we employed the Luminex 2000 platform to determine the cytokine protein content in discrete brain regions of C57BL/6J mice. In spike-and-recovery experiments, known concentrations of murine recombinant interleukin (IL)-1, 1 beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha were added either singly or as a mixture of all three to whole brain homogenates containing known quantities of total protein. Spiked samples were assayed for either a single cytokine or for multiple cytokines using 1-plex or 3-plex assay kits, respectively. In whole mouse brain homogenate we recovered between 81% and 103% of the recombinant cytokines. We then injected C57BL/6J mice intraperitoneally with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and sacrificed them 4 h later. We detected in samples taken from LPS-stimulated mice 4- to 870-fold increases in serum or spleen cytokine protein, and 1.5- to 16-fold increases in cytokine protein in discrete brain regions, relative to protein content in samples obtained from vehicle-treated animals. These results indicate that multiple cytokines may be reliably assayed from discrete regions of mouse brain using a single sample. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A low-cost open-hardware wideband multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) wireless channel sounder	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT			English	Article						measurement; multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO); wideband	5.2 GHZ; TIME	Due to the complexity of multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) wireless channels, direct measurement is the main viable option for accurate characterization. Details on a new low-cost wideband channel sounder are presented, which was mainly constructed from conventional instruments and components. This switched architecture system is similar to commercial channel sounders and has modest cost (< US$ 50000). The sounder operates in the 2- to 8-GHz range with up to 100 MHz of instantaneous bandwidth and supports eight transmitters and receivers, which are sufficient to support the development and assessment of current and future MIMO wireless systems. In this "open-hardware" project, the hardware design and software components are openly available to other researchers interested in developing or enhancing the MIMO measurement capability. The actual systems built at the University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa, and Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, are presented, as are some example studies.	[Maharaj, B.

Several hundred integrated computing nodes, each hosting up to 512 neurons, will he interconnected and operated on un-cut silicon wafers. The electro-technical aspects and the details of the hardware implementation are covered in a separate contribution to this conference. This paper focuses on the usability of the system by demonstrating that biologically relevant network models can in fact be mapped to this system. Different network configurations am established on the hardware by programmable switch matrices, repeaters, and address decoders. Systematic routing algorithms are presented to map a given network model to the hardware system. Routing is simulated for several network examples, proving the system's practical applicability. Furthermore, the routing simulations are used to fix values for yet open hardware parameters.

The target implementation of the embedded system is a Spartan family FPGA from Xilinx. The article presents the main features of the base system, which consists of the LEON microprocessor and a Linux operating system distribution (Debian) running on it. Moreover, it shows a complete example of how to add new peripherals to the system. The peripheral that has been added is the UART 16550 compatible peripheral available in OpenCores. Given that the design has been prepared for the WishBone bus, it was necessary to adapt it to the APB bus within the LEON core. Furthermore, it has been adapted to work with the Linux driver for that UART to get a full coupling of peripheral with the system. The experimental results confirm the work done.

In this context, the LEGO (R) MINDSTORMS (R) NXT modular robot appears as a simple, flexible and attractive educational platform to achieve the referred challenge in many domains of information technologies, especially in real-time control. The project team can operate with the real system (e.g. constructed robot) to realize a number of particular tasks. The ready-to-use embedded platform and dual microcontrollers architecture represents actual trends in the modern control systems designs. The open hardware and software architecture gives unlimited possibility to handle all devices connected to the main control brick and write effective control algorithms. The proposed rescue robot project is a good example of the simple system where, a number of real-time control problems can be analyzed. The project on this scale requires detailed planning, cooperation in teams, extensive literature survey, and comprehensive software design. That is exactly, what we need for "learning by projects" concept.

The open-source software toolkit for the software defined radio, GNU Radio, is utilized to realize the basic function of the receiver and perform fast signal processing. The software is written in Python for a LINUX PC. The open-source hardware called Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP), which best matches the GNU Radio, is used as a front-end to acquire the satellite beacon signals of 150 and 400 MHz. The first experiment was successful as results from GRBR showed very good agreement to those from the co-located analog beacon receiver.

The proposed approach exploits the ability of mobile robots to navigate in unstructured, cluttered and potentially hostile environments using calibrated odometry information, proximity sensor data and a fuzzy logic engine. A key advantage to this technique is its simplicity over similar navigation systems discussed in the literature. The simplification stems from the fact that only the previous traveled position of the robot needs to be tracked to reach to the target position. The superiority of this technique is supported by the experimental results that were collected for this purpose.	[Miah, Md.

To build the platform, we have adopted the OpenCores-Openhardware design concept. The benefit of using the OpenCores methodology is flexibility, reuse and accessibility of the cores at free cost. We demonstrate how the open hardware trend can help designers to build complex integrated circuits such as SoCs at low cost. To test the platform, our first application is a SoC implementation of a Voice Over IP (VoIP) Gateway. The first preliminary results show that the whole SoC can be implemented in the field programmable gate array (FPGA) - XC2V1000 circuit.

Today, an increasing number of open source solutions enter the market and become valid alternatives to proprietary and closed solutions. Examples include operating systems like Linux and OpenSolaris, back-end solutions (e.g. LAMP - Linux, Apache web server, MySQL database, and Perl/PHP/Python programming languages - are among the most well-known and widely used open source software on the Internet), office applications (e.g. Firefox web browser, Thunderbird email, GIMP graphics, OpenOffice office suite), and complete enterprise systems like Compiere (ERP and CRM) and Mambo content management system (CMS). In addition, a variety of devices increasingly include open source (e.g. cellular phones, network equipment like routers, and Asterisk - a complete IP PBX). The open source culture is about much more than software and includes open source hardware, views on intellectual properties rights, completely changes how products are developed and owned, and how business models are developed. To decide if open source is something for you, a good understanding of what open source really means is necessary. This includes legal aspects (different licenses), availability of support with (hopefully a thriving) user community and commercial for-pay support options, and security. Intellectual properties rights, and the vast number of many types of open source licenses (e.g. GNU General Public License (GPL) and BSD License), is one of the more complex areas when using open source. What can and not can be done, what must be done, and so on, vary between licenses. One effort to bring some order in all this is the Open Source Definition (OSD) from Open Source Initiative (OSI) which lists ten conditions that must be met for an OSI Certified open source license. Today, many companies have already been forced to either remove or release as open source code borrowed by developers without properly complying with licenses. Such "dirty code" is increasingly easy to detect via compliance tools used by companies doing this as business. (Not to mention whistle-blowing employees tipping of property owners.) Searching for dirty code is also increasingly part of due diligence in mergers and acquisitions and can add costly delays and lawsuits. The perceived low cost is often a reason for considering open source solutions but the total costs of development (TCD) including for example licenses, tools, labor, and support - must be considered from initial design, to maintenance, all through the end of life of the product. This paper reviews critical aspects for going open source, including software and hardware, use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) alternatives, system design going from a monolithic, single-binary, firmware to a layered design with operating system, middleware, and user applications.

However, a number of barriers have stood in the way of the integration of eye tracking into everyday applications, including the intrusiveness, robustness, availability and price of eye-tracking systems. To lower these barriers, we have developed the openEyes system. The system consists of an open-hardware design for a digital eye tracker that can be built from low-cost off-the-shelf components, and a set of open-source software tools for digital image capture, manipulation, and analysis in eye-tracking applications. We expect that the availability of this system will facilitate the development of eye-tracking applications and the eventual integration of eye tracking into the next generation of everyday human computer interfaces. We discuss the methods and technical challenges of low-cost eye tracking as well as the design decisions that produced our current system.

To preserve this investment, attention must be given to proper maintenance. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has emerged as a tool to support this task. Networks of smart sensors, built upon wireless communication, have the potential to significantly improve SHM. Numerous platforms for smart sensors have been developed, most of which utilise proprietary hardware/software. The Berkeley Mote, utilised in this study, was the first open hardware/software platform to be developed. However, the Berkeley Mote was designed for generic applications and therefore the available sensors are not optimised for use in civil infrastructure applications. Acceleration and strain are among the most important physical quantities to judge the health of a structure. Although commercially available sensor boards have accelerometers, their applicability towards civil infrastructure is limited. This paper presents the development of new acceleration and strain sensor boards based on the Berkely-Mote platform and provides experimental verification of their performance within civil infrastructure applications.

One of these features is the possibility of reconfiguring a section of the FPGA while the rest is working. Moreover, this fixed part could be responsible for reprogramming the reconfigurable part, either because a change in functionality is required or because a new version of the hardware needs to be implemented. This paper shows how an FPGA system based on an Open Source OpenRISC 1200 microprocessor takes advantage of this feature to perform the Secure Download of the firmware and the hardware needed to run an application.

Specifically, just as open source has spawned a revolution in the technical, business, and legal model for software, open hardware will provide a swell of collaborative innovation that will create entirely new markets and provide significant business benefits to the most creative, most reliable, and most adaptable semiconductor, EDA, System-On-Chip (SoC) and systems houses. The open-source software stack with Linux as its cornerstone is increasingly the preferred choice for newly venture-funded companies. Open hardware will also change the world of SoC venture investing. While the degree of openness and the business model may vary, SoC products have to be increasingly developed through a collaborative model that helps assemble IP blocks and services from multiple sources. In this paper we describe the open standards model for hardware, chip, and tool innovation, and we argue the a systematic IP valuation methodology will help the success of this. environment, in that it will allow each member of the value chain especially small VC-backed companies - to capture enough value to desire to participate.

B	Brown, S			IEEE	Brown, S			Real world applications of synthetic instrumentation	AUTOTESTCON 2004, PROCEEDINGS: TECHNOLOGY AND TRADITION UNITE IN SAN ANTONIO			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Systems Readiness Technology Conference (AUTOTESTCON 04)	SEP 20-23, 2004	San Antonio, TX	IEEE Aerosp & Elect Syst Soc, IEEE Instrumentat & Measurement Soc, IEEE Cent Texas Council				A current focus of many instrumentation and Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) designers is the area of Synthetic Instrumentation. This instrumentation, which consists of physically separate building blocks or modules, provides the opportunity to reduce the system's overall hardware content by eliminating common hardware functionality located within each traditional instrument. This modular design provides opportunities for lower lifecycle cost, smaller physical packages and increased capabilities through module upgrades. However, the design of synthetic instrumentation and its integration into an ATE system poses technical challenges not typically seen with traditional instrumentation. Traditional instrument developers are now faced with the challenge of determining how their existing and future modules, for example a digitizer or waveform generator, satisfy a portion of the requirements of a synthetic instrument. ATE developers are challenged to identify the proper set of modules, primarily Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS), that together satisfy the system level requirements. In addition, they must address instrumentation concurrency, synchronization, switching, and develop a software and hardware architecture that supports future upgrades as technology advances. Each of these issues requires a strong system engineering discipline that can develop a robust system architecture. In 2002 SEI began a program to integrate synthetic instrumentation that provided the functionality of a spectrum analyzer, A/D converter, counter timer, UART and AVMUX into a legacy Air Force Test Station. In 2003 SEI continued with an additional program that consisted of design and development of a synthetic instrument that provided the functionality of a power meter, spectrum analyzer, frequency time interval counter, oscilloscope and digital multi meter. During each of these programs SEI worked directly with commercial instrument manufacturers, electrical designers and the military to establish the system requirements and resulting architecture. This paper will describe the key technical issues encountered while defining the system architecture including concurrency, modularity, synchronization, and maintaining an open hardware and software architecture. In addition, the resultant system architecture will be described.

Some of the most important developed projects are OSACA in Europe, OSEC in Japan and OMAC in the US. All these efforts are directed to the definition of an open architecture for controllers of manufacturing systems. The PC (personal computer) as the control platform facilitates the conectivity, standardization and availability of components, and the cost reduction. An aspect, however, remains scarcely analized: the application of these concepts on equipments designed with a propietary control structure. An open control system for an SCARA industrial robot YAMAHA YK7000 has been developed to analize its viability and evaluate difficulties and limitations. The controller follows the guidelines defined by the OMAC architecture (Open Modular Architecture for Controllers). The control functions were implemented on a dual platform (two PCs): The first PC supports the critical functions. executing the paths planning and axes control tasks with a commercial axes control card. The second one supports the functions of user interfacing with the user and other non-critical time applications. Both computers are connected by a TCP/IP link.

PSAS is currently developing medium-sized sub-orbital rockets with the eventual goal of inserting nanosatellites (satellites that weigh less than 10 kg) into orbit. Because achieving orbit requires a navigation system able to guide the rocket along an orbital trajectory, PSAS is pioneering an open source and open hardware avionics system that is capable of active guidance. In this paper, we describe how free software and open hardware have dramatically changed the capabilities of amateur aerospace groups like PSAS. We show how we have applied existing and custom free software to the avionics and ground support systems of a sub-orbital sounding rocket, and discuss what further work must be done. We conclude that the sophistication and complexity achieved by current amateur avionics projects-which are beginning to challenge the distinction between amateur and professional-would not be possible without the use of free software.

Both periodic and non-periodic in-plane micro motions could be measured by the blur-synthesis method based on the machine vision technology. The periodic out-of-plane micro motions could be estimated by the laser stroboscopic phase-shifting interferometry with the digital image processing technology. Some improved algorithms together with the sub pixel method and 2D waveform transform technology are bought forward and experimented for the measurement of micro motions with higher resolution. The methods could measure micro motions up to tens of KHz in real time with nano resolution and the characterization is both in situ and nondestructive. Based upon the virtual instrument technology, the measurement system with friendly user interfaces, open hardware and software architectures and expansible features could be used practically in MEMS R&D field and more improvements to this system could be made continually.

We have constructed a test-bed using Pentium PCs and Linux and used this test-bed to try a well-known MPLS traffic engineering feature of separating flows into multiple trunks. The. purpose of this separation is to experimentally assess the quality of service benefits we can expect from MPLS networks. We experiment with a hierarchical separation structure where the first level of separation is based on the transport layer used (TCP or UDP). This high level separation prevents UDP from unfairly grabbing the available bandwidth from TCP applications. Since different applications using TCP have different needs, e.g., some might want high bandwidth while others are more sensitive to packet delay, the second level of separation is based on application type. The results from our open experimental test-bed confirms the intuitive results by demonstrating better QoS with the flow separation in the MPLS core.

In 1993 the Cuban Meteorological Service decided to mount a modernized radar prototype at Camaguey Meteorological Center, incorporating computer control and data acquisition hardware to achieve fully unmanned operation. Modernization of conventional weather radars is now possible within a small budget using open hardware and software architectures. Our Primary Processor "ELBRUS" (Signal Processor + Radar Controller) makes use of available computer cards and commercial PC systems. The system architecture was designed with a particular stress on software. All functions that could be handled within the Data Acquisition Computer have been put there. Also, a versatile Product Generator and Processing System were developed. Vests processor Vesta RPG and its front end application Vesta\Process deal with product and composite generation, data base management and web server links. They function in a server-client fashion using standard protocols. Results obtained with this prototype are now being extended to other 6 radars under a National Program for the modernization of the Cuban Weather Radar Network, which also includes composition and distribution of the products.

The experience of the Central Engineering Activity (CEA) GPS Laboratory at NRaD San Diego supports the need for such a receiver. The special investigations and R&D GPS projects conducted by NRaD frequently require novel integration or data collection capabilities. These would only be readily available in a flexible receiver with a high degree of adaptability to the laboratory's ever-changing needs. The GPS Integration Receiver-Programmable (GPS-PRO) receiver, which utilizes an open hardware and software architecture, provides the necessary flexibility to perform this function. The GPS-PRO uses Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) hardware, an open architecture for external sensors, external communications and control, digital control, open software architecture, functional breakout points, and an upgradable daughter board concept for application specific systems. Such a receiver configuration provides the flexibility to interchange or insert new hardware or software modules in order to evaluate their performance in a controlled environment or provide an integrated system solution. The GPS-PRO flexible (programmable) functionality allows for its use as a design tool for R&D and hardware in-the-loop testing, application specific tailoring for low cost, small size customer demands, while providing benchmark performance capabilities.
