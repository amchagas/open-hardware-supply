Abstract = {{One of the major obstacles in the study of HRI (human-robot interaction)
   with social robots is the lack of multiple identical robots that allow
   testing with large user groups. Often, the price of these robots
   prohibits using more than a handful. A lot of the commercial robots do
   not possess all the necessary features to perform specific HRI
   experiments and due to the closed nature of the platform, large
   modifications are nearly impossible. While open source social robots do
   exist, they often use high-end components and expensive manufacturing
   techniques, making them unsuitable for easy reproduction. To address
   this problem, a new social robotics platform, named Ono, was developed.
   The design is based on the DIY mindset of the maker movement, using
   off-the-shelf components and more accessible rapid prototyping and
   manufacturing techniques. The modular structure of the robot makes it
   easy to adapt to the needs of the experiment and by embracing the open
   source mentality, the robot can be easily reproduced or further
   developed by a community of users. The low cost, open nature and DIY
   friendliness of the robot make it an ideal candidate for HRI studies
   that require a large user group.}},

Abstract = {{Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) became popular platforms for the
   collection of remotely sensed geodata in the last years (Hardin \&
   Jensen 2011). Various applications in numerous fields of research like
   archaeology (Hendrickx et al., 2011), forestry or geomorphology evolved
   (Martinsanz, 2012). This contribution deals with the generation of
   multi-temporal crop surface models (CSMs) with very high resolution by
   means of low-cost equipment. The concept of the generation of
   multi-temporal CSMs using Terrestrial Laserscanning (TLS) has already
   been introduced by Hoffmeister et al. (2010). For this study, data
   acquisition was performed with a low-cost and low-weight Mini-UAV (<
   5kg). UAVs in general and especially smaller ones, like the system
   presented here, close a gap in small scale remote sensing (Berni et al.,
   2009; Watts et al., 2012). In precision agriculture frequent remote
   sensing on such scales during the vegetation period provides important
   spatial information on the crop status. Crop growth variability can be
   detected by comparison of the CSMs in different phenological stages.
   Here, the focus is on the detection of this variability and its
   dependency on cultivar and plant treatment. The method has been tested
   for data acquired on a barley experiment field in Germany. In this
   contribution, it is applied to a different crop in a different
   environment. The study area is an experiment field for rice in Northeast
   China (Sanjiang Plain). Three replications of the cultivars Kongyu131
   and Longjing21 were planted in plots that were treated with different
   amounts of N-fertilizer. In July 2012 three UAV-campaigns were carried
   out. Establishment of ground control points (GCPs) allowed for ground
   truth. Additionally, further destructive and non-destructive field data
   were collected. The UAV-system is an MK-Okto by Hisystems
   (www.mikrokopter.de) which was equipped with the high resolution
   Panasonic Lumix GF3 12 megapixel consumer camera. The self-built and
   self-maintained system has a payload of up to 1 kg and an average flight
   time of 15 minutes. The maximum speed is around 30 km/h and the system
   can be operated up to a wind speed of less than 19 km/h (Beaufort scale
   number 3 for wind speed). Using a suitable flight plan stereo images can
   be captured. For this study, a flying height of 50 m and a 44\% side and
   90\% forward overlap was chosen. The images are processed into CSMs
   under the use of the Structure from Motion (SfM)-based software Agisoft
   Photoscan 0.9.0. The resulting models have a resolution of 0.02 m and an
   average number of about 12 million points. Further data processing in
   Esri ArcGIS allows for quantitative comparison of the plant heights. The
   multi-temporal datasets are analysed on a plot size basis. The results
   can be compared to and combined with the additional field data.
   Detecting plant height with non-invasive measurement techniques enables
   analysis of its correlation to biomass and other crop parameters (Hansen
   \& Schjoerring, 2003; Thenkabail et al., 2000) measured in the field.
   The method presented here can therefore be a valuable addition for the
   recognition of such correlations.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional manned airborne surveys are usually expensive and the
   resolution of the acquired images is often limited. The main advantage
   of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) system acting as a photogrammetric
   sensor platform over more traditional manned airborne system is the high
   flexibility that allows image acquisition from unconventional
   viewpoints, the low cost in comparison with classical aerial
   photogrammetry and the high resolution images obtained. Nowadays there
   is a necessity for surveying small areas and in these cases, it is not
   economical the use of normal large format aerial or metric cameras to
   acquire aerial photos, therefore, the use of UAV platforms can be very
   suitable. Also the large availability of digital cameras has strongly
   enhanced the capabilities of UAVs. The use of digital non metric cameras
   together with the UAV could be used for multiple applications such as
   aerial surveys, GIS, wildfire mapping, stability of landslides, crop
   monitoring, etc. The aim of this work was to develop a low cost and
   accurate methodology in the production of orthophotos and Digital
   Elevation Models (DEM). The study was conducted in the province of
   Almeria, south of Spain. The photogrammetric flight had an altitude of
   50 m over ground, covering an area of 5.000 m(2) approximately. The UAV
   used in this work was the md4-200, which is an electronic battery
   powered quadrocopter UAV developed by Microdrones GmbH, Germany. It had
   on-board a Pextax Optio A40 digital non metric camera with 12
   Megapixels. It features a 3x optical zoom lens with a focal range
   covering angles of view equivalent to those of 37-111 mm lens in 35 mm
   format. The quadrocopter can be programmed to follow a route defined by
   several waypoints and actions and it has the ability for vertical take
   off and landing. Proper flight geometry during image acquisition is
   essential in order to minimize the number of photographs, avoid areas
   without a good coverage and make the overlaps homogeneous. The flight
   planning was done using the MdCockpit software, with the module waypoint
   editor. Flight route file was downloaded into the quadrocopter
   autonomous chip via cable. A total of twelve vertical images with a
   longitudinal and transversal overlapping of 60 \% and 50 \% respectively
   were taken. The digital camera was previously geometrically calibrated.
   Field control points covering the whole studied area were defined over
   the area of interest and their coordinates were measured by a GPS.
   Natural targets were used as field control points. The close range
   photogrammetric software Photomodeler Scanner v.7 was used in this work
   to calibrate the camera and to carry out the photogrammetric process.
   The software Golden Surfer was used to produce the DEM. The planimetric
   and the altimetric root mean square error (RMSE) were calculated in
   order to check the accuracy of the products. The RMSEx was 6 cm, the
   RMSEy was 4 cm and the RMSEy was 7 cm. Our preliminary results
   demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of orthophotos and DEMs
   obtained from images captured from a quadrocopter using low cost
   photogrammetric software. A future work can be the comparison of the
   products obtained following the route used in this study where the
   images are taken vertically with the products obtained with an orbital
   route where the number of images will be diminished and the photos will
   be taken oblique.}},

Abstract = {{We present the development of a four-channel low-cost hardware system
   for data acquisition, with application in dedicated nuclear medicine
   imagers. A 12 bit octal channel high-speed analogue to digital
   converter, with up to 65 Msps sampling rate, was used for the
   digitization of analogue signals. The digitized data are fed into a
   field programmable gate array (FPGA), which contains an interface to a
   bank of double data rate 2 (DDR2)-type memory. The FPGA processes the
   digitized data and stores the results into the DDR2. An ethernet link
   was used for data transmission to a personal computer. The embedded
   system was designed using Xilinx's embedded development kit (EDK) and
   was based on Xilinx's Microblaze soft-core processor. The system has
   been evaluated using two different discrete optical detector arrays (a
   position-sensitive photomultiplier tube and a silicon photomultiplier)
   with two different pixelated scintillator arrays (BGO, LSO:Ce). The
   energy resolution for both detectors was approximately 25\%. A clear
   identification of all crystal elements was achieved in all cases. The
   data rate of the system with this implementation can reach 60 Mbits
   s(-1). The results have shown that this FPGA data acquisition system is
   a compact and flexible solution for single-photon-detection
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel probabilistic framework for reliable indoor
   positioning of mobile sensor network devices. Compared to existing
   approaches, ours adopts complex computations in exchange for high
   localization accuracy while needing low hardware investment and moderate
   set-up cost. To that end, we use full distributional information on
   signal measurements at a set of discrete locations, termed landmarks.
   Positioning of a mobile device is done relative to the resulting
   landmark graph and the device can be found near a landmark or in the
   area between two landmarks. Key elements of our approach include
   profiling the signal measurement distributions over the coverage area
   using a special interpolation technique; a two-tier statistical
   positioning scheme that improves efficiency by adding movement
   detection; and joint clusterhead placement optimization for both
   localization and movement detection. The proposed system is practical
   and has been implemented using standard wireless sensor network
   hardware. Experimentally, our system achieved an accuracy equivalent to
   less than 5 meters with 95 percent success probability and less than 3
   meters with an 87 percent success probability. This performance is
   superior to well-known contemporary systems that use similar low-cost
   hardware.}},

Title = {{Vdiff: a program differencing algorithm for Verilog hardware description

Abstract = {{During code review tasks, comparing two versions of a hardware design
   description using existing program differencing tools such as diff is
   inherently limited because these tools implicitly assume sequential
   execution semantics, while hardware description languages are designed
   to model concurrent computation. We designed a position-independent
   differencing algorithm to robustly handle language constructs whose
   relative orderings do not matter. This paper presents Vdiff, an
   instantiation of this position-independent differencing algorithm for
   Verilog HDL. To help programmers reason about the differences at a
   high-level, Vdiff outputs syntactic differences in terms of
   Verilog-specific change types. The quantitative evaluation of Vdiff on
   two open source hardware design projects shows that Vdiff is very
   accurate, with overall 96.8 \% precision and 97.3 \% recall when using
   manually classified differences as a basis of comparison. Vdiff is also
   fast and scalable-it processes the entire revision history of nine open
   projects all under 5.35 minutes. We conducted a user study with eight
   hardware design experts to understand how the program differences
   identified by the experts match Vdiff's output. The study results show
   that Vdiff's output is better aligned with the experts' classification
   of Verilog changes than an existing textual program differencing tool.}},

Abstract = {{Researchers have shown that the Electronic Product Code (EPC) Class-1
   Generation-2 (C1G2) specification has serious security problems. To
   overcome these weaknesses, some authors have proposed a specially
   designed pad generation (PadGen) function to improve security. The
   PadGen function is used to produce a cover-coding pad to mask the tag's
   access password before the data are transmitted. In this paper, we study
   the radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag-reader mutual
   authentication (TRMA) scheme. Two improved authentication protocols for
   generating the PadGen function are described. A hardware design of these
   RFID authentication protocols conforming to the International Standards
   Organization 18000-6 Type-C protocol, also known as EPC C1G2 RFID
   protocol, is proposed. Since tags have an extremely limited computing
   power and storage capacity, the PadGen function based on exclusive-OR
   operation for low-cost hardware implementation is reported in this
   study. The proposed RFID TRMA protocol was simulated using Modelsim XE
   II and synthesized using Altera's Quartus II software. The functionality
   of these strengthening protocols was successfully verified in hardware
   using an Altera DE2 board that included an Altera Cyclone II
   field-programmable gate array.}},

Abstract = {{Acoustic sensing to gather information about a machine can be highly
   beneficial, but processing the data can be difficult. In this work, a
   variety of methodologies have been studied to extract rotor speed
   information from the sound signature of an autonomous helicopter, with
   no a-priori knowledge of its underlying acoustic properties.
   The autonomous helicopter has two main rotors that are mostly identical.
   In order to identify the rotors' speeds individually, a comparative
   evaluation has been made of learning methods with input selection,
   reduction and aggregation methods. The resulting estimators have been
   tested on unseen training data as well as in actual free-flight tests.
   The best results were found by using a genetic algorithm to identify the
   important frequency bands, a centroid method to aggregate the bands, and
   a neural-network estimator of the rotor speeds. This approach succeeded
   in estimating individual rotor speeds of an autonomous helicopter
   without being distracted by the other, mainly identical, rotor. These
   results were achieved using standard, low-cost hardware, and a learning
   approach that did not require any a-priori knowledge about the system's
   acoustic properties. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a Pseudo three-dimensional Vision-based Nail-fold
   Morphological and Hemodynamic Analysis (PTVNMHA) is proposed to
   automatically extract morphological/hemodynamic features from a
   microscopic nail-fold image sequence, reconstruct the corresponding
   pseudo three-dimensional microvascular models, and visualize the dynamic
   blood flow in the model constructed. The morphological features
   extracted include the number, width/height, density, arteriolar limb
   caliber, curved segment caliber, venular limb caliber, blood color,
   tortuosity, and width of the curved segment of capillaries. The
   hemodynamic features identified are blood flow velocity and blood flow
   rate. All are significant pathological indicators with a spatial
   precision up to 1.6 mu m. The diameters of cross-sections along the
   centerlines of capillaries are identified and employed to reconstruct
   the pseudo three-dimensional microvascular surface meshes. The
   microscopic image sequence acquired is mapped to the corresponding
   microvascular model constructed to perform dynamic blood flow
   visualization. Compared with laser Doppler velocimetry, PTVNMHA can
   derive blood flow velocities for each capillary across the microscopic
   range separately in much higher precision and obtain diversified
   morphological and hemodynamic features of capillaries with a low-cost
   equipment setup. In addition to the blood flow velocity, blood flow
   rate, which keeps almost constant no matter where the measuring position
   is in a capillary, has also been measured and proposed as a useful
   feature to discriminate patients with hypertension from the normal with
   great significance (p < 0.001). In the future, large scale experiments
   will be conducted to diagnose patients with anemia as well as patients
   with essential and secondary hypertension to verify effectiveness of the
   PTVNMHA system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved,}},

Abstract = {{The commercial success of open source software, along with a broader
   socio-cultural shift towards participation in media and cultural
   production, have inspired attempts to extend and expand open source
   practices. These include expansions from software into general culture
   through `Free Culture' movements and, more recently, expansions from
   software into hardware and design. This article provides a critical
   perspective on the democratic potential of these broader `open'
   contribution structures by examining how open source contributions to
   both software and hardware increase the opportunities for democratic
   participation in production, governance and knowledge exchange. By
   analysing attempts to `open source' the sharing of hardware designs, it
   also notes the limitations of this democratization. The insights
   developed in the article nuance the relationship between open source
   cultures and commercial and market structures, identifying how the
   generative opportunities created by certain aspects of open source
   contribution structures increase the potential for democratizing
   production of communication tools, but also how incongruities across
   different open-source cultures and communities of practice limit the
   democratic potential of these processes.}},

Abstract = {{Modeling and simulation are powerful tools to design power distribution
   systems made up of multiple converters and loads, such as the system of

   approach is necessary. This paper proposes a large-signal black-box
   modeling technique of three-phase voltage source inverters. The
   resulting model is oriented to perform system-level analysis and is
   fully parameterized from the transient response of the converter, which
   is obtained through simple experimental tests based on low-cost
   equipment. Moreover, it does not represent the internal data of the
   converter, thus keeping the confidentiality of the manufacturer. The
   proposed method has been experimentally validated on a 5-kW actual

   distribution system.}},

Abstract = {{Hardware designs that can support multiple standards are required for
   versatile media players. The study proposes a unified inverse transform
   architecture that can be efficiently used in Moving Picture Expert Group
   and ITU International Telecommunication Standardisation Sector (ITU-T)
   H. 264/advanced video coding (AVC), Microsoft video codec 1 (VC-1) and
   Chinese Audio Video Coding Standard (AVS) decoders. For H. 264/AVC 8-,
   4- and 2-point inverse transforms, the computational complexity in the
   proposed architecture is similar to that defined in the H. 264/AVC
   standard. By using the symmetry of the transform matrices, the matrix
   product operations of the inverse transforms in VC-1 and AVS are
   efficiently decomposed to use only shifters, adders and subtractors. All
   the computations are verified and designed using a hardware unit to

   architecture contains fast 1-D transforms and rounding operations for
   the computation of H. 264/AVC, VC-1 and AVS 8- and 4-point inverse

   incorporated in the hardware design process to develop approximate

   proposed architectures make distinction between low-and high-entropy
   portions of the input data to intelligently trade off bit precision with
   hardware complexity. Mathematical and experimental results show
   mean-relative-error figures to be as low as 1.2\% and the performance to
   be as good as conventional full-precision processing scenarios.

Abstract = {{Predefined sequences of eye movements, or `gaze gestures', can be
   consciously performed by humans and monitored non-invasively using
   remote video oculography. Gaze gestures hold great potential in
   human-computer interaction, HCI, as long as they can be easily
   assimilated by potential users, monitored using low cost gaze tracking
   equipment and machine learning algorithms are able to distinguish the
   spatio-temporal structure of intentional gaze gestures from typical gaze
   activity performed during standard HCI. In this work, an evaluation of
   the performance of a bioinspired Bayesian pattern recognition algorithm
   known as Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) on the real time recognition
   of gaze gestures is carried out through a user study. To improve the
   performance of traditional HTM during real time recognition, an
   extension of the algorithm is proposed in order to adapt HTM to the
   temporal structure of gaze gestures. The extension consists of an
   additional top node in the HTM topology that stores and compares
   sequences of input data by sequence alignment using dynamic programming.
   The spatio-temporal codification of a gesture in a sequence serves the
   purpose of handling the temporal evolution of gaze gestures instances.
   The extended HTM allows for reliable discrimination of intentional gaze
   gestures from otherwise standard human-machine gaze interaction reaching
   up to 98\% recognition accuracy for a data set of 10 categories of gaze
   gestures, acceptable completion speeds and a low rate of false positives
   during standard gaze-computer interaction. These positive results
   despite the low cost hardware employed supports the notion of using gaze
   gestures as a new HCI paradigm for the fields of accessibility and
   interaction with smartphones, tablets, projected displays and
   traditional desktop computers. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Small-scale and household low-cost technologies to provide water free of
   arsenic for drinking purposes, suitable for isolated rural and periurban
   areas not connected to water networks in Latin America are described.
   Some of them are merely adaptation of conventional technologies already
   used at large and medium scale, but others are environmentally friendly
   emerging procedures that use local materials and resources of the
   affected zone. The technologies require simple and low-cost equipment
   that can be easily handled and maintained by the local population. The
   methods are based on the following processes: combination of
   coagulation/flocculation with adsorption, adsorption with geological and
   other low-cost natural materials, electrochemical technologies,
   biological methods including phytoremediation, use of zerovalent iron
   and photochemical processes. Examples of relevant research studies and
   developments in the region are given. In some cases, processes have been
   tested only at the laboratory level and there is not enough information
   about the costs. However, it is considered that the presented
   technologies constitute potential alternatives for arsenic removal in
   isolated rural and periurban localities of Latin America. Generation,
   handling and adequate disposal of residues should be taken into account
   in all cases. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The geometry of an acoustic environment can be an important information
   in many audio signal processing applications. To estimate such a
   geometry, previous work has relied on large microphone arrays, multiple
   test sources, moving sources or the assumption of a 2-D room. In this
   paper, we lift these requirements and present a novel method that uses a
   compact microphone array to estimate a 3-D room geometry, delivering
   effective estimates with low-cost hardware. Our approach first probes
   the environment with a known test signal emitted by a loudspeaker
   co-located with the array, from which the room impulse responses (RIRs)
   are estimated. It then uses an l(1)-regularized least-squares
   minimization to fit synthetically generated reflections to the RIRs,
   producing a sparse set of reflections. By enforcing structural
   constraints derived from the image model, these are classified into
   first-, second-, and third-order reflections, thereby deriving the room
   geometry. Using this method, we detect walls using off-the-shelf
   teleconferencing hardware with a typical range resolution of about 1 cm.
   We present results using simulations and data from real environments.}},

Abstract = {{We explore whether public data networks called SocialMesh - formed
   automatically from smartphone radio-routers and adapting to changing RF
   propagation and interference without relying on managed cellular
   infrastructure - can also be designed to overcome any and all
   countermeasures mounted by an attacker and reliably support social
   applications such as Twitter, Face-book, and Google. We rigorously
   examine the architecture, techniques and algorithms that make
   decentralized or ``ad-hoc,{''} ultrawideband networks work in the
   presence of hostile jamming or protocol attacks. We illustrate the RF
   link-budget using 3-d graphs to show how interference affects the
   network performance as these networks become heavily utilized or jammed.
   Using low-cost hardware, self-organizing routing software, and
   uncoordinated/distributed CDMA we show how they can retain adequate
   system capacity even under heavy load from users or interference from
   jammers. Open standardization and field trials of SocialMesh networks
   will further clarify SocialMesh security and performance by opening up
   the design specifications to international review. Open-source design

Abstract = {{The evaluation of nutritional or functional components in grain products
   is an important feature for the industry, especially when recent
   regulations require a correct nutrition labelling, valid during all the
   shelf life of the product. For that reason, industry usually makes many
   efforts to develop simple and reliable analytical methods that can be
   easily applied in any quality control laboratories for routine analysis.
   Spectrofluorimetric analysis of thiamine and riboflavin are sensitive,
   but need specific equipment. A few HPLC-UV methods have been described
   but they are less sensitive, and present difficulties due to interfering
   compounds, particularly in complex food matrixes, as grains and
   derivatives.
   A combination of extraction and separation systems, that allows enough
   sensitivity, precision and accuracy for the analysis of vitamin B-1 and
   B-2 in complex cereal food products, by isocratic UV-HPLC, in a single
   wavelength simultaneous separation is presented, with the advantage of
   using low-cost equipment requirements, simple sample pre-treatment and
   short time. The achievement of this goal has involved the optimization
   of compatible extraction and measurement protocols for cereal matrices,
   comparing seven different separation conditions and six
   extraction/clarification matrices analysis. The selected method was
   comparatively validated and compared to reference AOAC
   spectrofluorimetric methods, providing comparable linearity and
   accuracy, with better specificity and precision parameters, as well as
   practical applicability. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Problem The Brazilian population lacks equitable access to specialized
   health care and diagnostic tests, especially in remote municipalities,
   where health professionals often feel isolated and staff turnover is
   high. Telehealth has the potential to improve patients'access to
   specialized health care, but little is known about it in terms of
   cost-effectiveness, access to services or user satisfaction.
   Approach In 2005, the State Government of Minas Gerais, Brazil, funded
   the establishment of the Telehealth Network, intended to connect
   university hospitals with the state's remote municipal health
   departments; support professionals in providing tele-assistance; and
   perform tele-electrocardiography and teleconsultations. The network uses
   low-cost equipment and has employed various strategies to overcome the
   barriers to telehealth use.
   Local setting The Telehealth Network connects specialists in state
   university hospitals with primary health-care professionals in 608
   Municipalities of the large state of Minas Gerais, many of them in
   remote areas.
   Relevant changes From June 2006 to October 2011, 782 773
   electrocardiograms and 30 883 teleconsultations were performed through
   the network, and 6000 health professionals were trained in its use. Most
   of these professionals (97\%) were satisfied with the system, which was
   cost-effective, economically viable and averted 81\% of potential case
   referrals to distant centres.
   Lessons learnt To succeed, a telehealth service must be part of a
   collaborative network, meet the real needs of local health
   professionals, use simple technology and have at least some face-to-face
   components. If applied to health problems for which care is in high
   demand, this type of service can be economically viable and can help to
   improve patient access to specialized health care.}},

Abstract = {{An accurate and low-cost hybrid solution to the problem of autonomous
   self-localization in wireless sensor networks (WSN) is presented. The
   solution is designed to perform robustly under challenging radio
   propagation conditions in mind, while requiring low deployment efforts,
   and utilizing only low-cost hardware and light-weight distributed
   algorithms for location computation. Our solution harnesses the
   strengths of two approaches for environments with complex propagation
   characteristics: RF mapping to provide an initial estimate of each
   sensor's position based on a coarse-grain RF map acquired with minimal
   efforts; and a cooperative light-weight spring relaxation technique for
   each sensor to refine its estimate using Kalman filtered inter-node
   distance measurements. Using Kalman filtering to pre-process noisy
   distance measurements inherent in complex propagation environments, is
   found to have significant positive impacts on the subsequent accuracy
   and the convergence of our spring relaxation algorithm. Through
   extensive simulations using realistic settings and real data set, we
   show that our approach is a practical localization solution which can
   achieve sub-meter accuracy and fast convergence under harsh propagation
   conditions, with no specialized hardware or significant efforts required
   to deploy.}},

Abstract = {{Conventionally, a frequency can be uniquely determined when the sampling
   rate is higher than the Nyquist rate. In some applications, such as
   sensor network with low transmission rate sensors, it is necessary that
   the sampling rate to be under the Nyquist rate; in this case, a
   frequency determination method based on its under-sampled waveform is
   needed. Several studies have been done to extract real input frequency
   from under-sampled sinusoidal complex waveform. This paper presents a
   novel method for unambiguous and unique frequency determination of
   under-sampled real sinusoidal waveform. The proposed method needs a low
   cost hardware in compare with the frequency determination of
   under-sampled sinusoidal complex waveform. First, we determine the upper
   frequency bound which the frequency can be extracted unambiguously from
   under-sampled real sinusoidal waveform. Then, in order to extract real
   input frequency unambiguously and uniquely, the maximum tolerable amount
   of frequency error is determined from under-sampled sinusoidal real
   waveform. Moreover, we improve the previous method for frequency
   determination from under-sampled sinusoidal complex waveform. Finally,
   performance of the proposed schemes is verified by some simulation

Abstract = {{Modern hardware security has a very broad scope ranging from digital
   rights management to the detection of ghost circuitry. These and many
   other security tasks are greatly hindered by process variation, which
   makes each integrated circuit (IC) unique, and device aging, which
   evolves the IC throughout its lifetime. We have developed a singular
   value decomposition (SVD)-based procedure for gate-level
   characterization (GLC) that calculates changes in properties, such as
   delay and switching power of each gate of an IC, accounting for process
   variation and device aging. We employ our SVD-based GLC approach for the
   development of two security applications: hardware metering and ghost
   circuitry (GC) detection. We present the first robust and low-cost
   hardware metering scheme, using an overlapping IC partitioning approach
   that enables rapid and scalable treatment. We also map the GC detection
   problem into an equivalent task of GLC consistency checking using the
   same overlapping partitioning. The effectiveness of the approaches is
   evaluated using the ISCAS85, ISCAS89, and ITC99 benchmarks. In hardware
   metering, we are able to obtain probabilities of coincidence in the
   magnitude of 10(-8) or less, and we obtain zero false positives and zero
   false negatives in GC detection.}},

Abstract = {{Future microprocessors need low-cost solutions for reliable operation in
   the presence of failure-prone devices. A promising approach is to detect
   hardware faults by deploying low-cost monitors of software-level
   symptoms of such faults. Recently, researchers have shown these
   mechanisms work well, but there remains a non-negligible risk that
   several faults may escape the symptom detectors and result in silent
   data corruptions (SDCs).
   Most prior evaluations of symptom-based detectors perform fault
   injection campaigns on application benchmarks, where each run simulates
   the impact of a fault injected at a hardware site at a certain point in
   the application's execution (application fault site). Since the total
   number of application fault sites is very large (trillions for standard
   benchmark suites), it is not feasible to study all possible faults.
   Previous work therefore typically studies a randomly selected sample of
   faults. Such studies do not provide any feedback on the portions of the
   application where faults were not injected. Some of those instructions
   may be vulnerable to SDCs, and identifying them could allow protecting
   them through other means if needed.
   This paper presents Relyzer, an approach that systematically analyzes
   all application fault sites and carefully picks a small subset to
   perform selective fault injections for transient faults. Relyzer employs
   novel fault pruning techniques that prune faults that need detailed
   study by either predicting their outcomes or showing them equivalent to
   other faults. We find that Relyzer prunes about 99.78\% of the total
   faults across twelve applications studied here, reducing the faults that
   require detailed simulation by 3 to 5 orders of magnitude for most of
   the applications. Fault injection simulations on the remaining faults
   can identify SDC causing faults in the entire application. Some of
   Relyzer's techniques rely on heuristics to determine fault equivalence.
   Our validation efforts show that Relyzer determines fault outcomes with
   96\% accuracy, averaged across all the applications studied here.}},

Abstract = {{Microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs) are superconducting
   detectors capable of counting single photons and measuring their energy

   MKIDs do not require the complex cryogenic multiplexing electronics used

   transfer this complexity to room temperature electronics where they
   present a formidable signal processing challenge. In this paper, we
   describe the first successful effort to build a readout for a photon
   counting optical/near-IR astronomical instrument, the ARray Camera for
   Optical to Near-infrared Spectrophotometry. This readout is based on
   open source hardware developed by the Collaboration for Astronomy Signal
   Processing and Electronics Research. Designed principally for radio
   telescope backends, it is flexible enough to be used for a variety of
   signal processing applications. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{CERN makes extensive use of the WorldFIP fieldbus interface in the LHC
   and other accelerators in the pre-injectors chain. Following the
   decision of the provider of the components to stop the developments in
   this field and foreseeing the potential problems in the subsequent
   support, CERN decided to purchase the design information of these
   components and in-source the future developments using this technology.
   The first in-house design concerns a replacement for the MicroFIP chip
   whose last version was manufactured in an IC feature size found to be
   more vulnerable to radiation of high energy particles than the previous
   versions. nanoFIP is a CERN design based on a Flash FPGA implementing a
   subset of the functionality allowed by the communication standard,
   fitting the requirements of the different users and including the
   robustness against radiation as a design constraint. The development
   presented involved several groups at CERN working together in the
   framework of the Open Hardware Repository collaboration, and aiming at
   maximizing the interoperability and reliability of the final product.}},

Abstract = {{This work describes a compact and low cost analyzer for laser induced
   breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) based on a diode pumped passively
   Q-switched Nd:LSB microchip laser and a conventional Czerny-Turner
   spectrograph (spectral range from about 250 to 390 nm) containing a
   non-intensified, non-gated and non-cooled 1024 pixel linear sensor
   array. The new LIBS instrument was applied for analyzing steel samples
   containing chromium and nickel in the concentration range from about 5
   to 26\% w/w (certified reference materials), integrating the emitted
   radiation for 40 s under continuous application of laser pulses at 2 kHz
   for each acquired spectrum (integration of about 80,000 plasmas). The
   emission data from about 356 to 362 nm and 340 to 354 nm were employed
   for the construction of two Partial Least Squares (PLS) calibration
   models for determination of chromium and nickel, respectively. The
   average relative errors of prediction of chromium and nickel
   concentrations were 3.7 and 6.7\%, respectively, which are similar to or
   lower than those obtained using higher cost LIBS analyzers. The results
   have shown that multivariate calibration can help to overcome the
   decreasing instrumental performance associated with the low cost

   Composite Applications}},
Journal = {{SAMPE JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{24-29}},

Abstract = {{Continuous fiber reinforced plastics with a thermoplastic matrix are
   recyclable, weldable and suitable for many structural applications. Due
   to the short cycle times of about 1 minute, forming processes for
   thermoplastic composite parts are already capable of series production.
   Two of the most important forming techniques are Matched Die Forming and
   Diaphragm Forming. The Matched Die Forming provides short cycle times
   and high processing temperatures but requires complex and expensive
   molds. The Diaphragm Arming Process enables the use of low cost tooling
   and machinery and provides a high degree of flexibility. On the other
   hand its processing temperature range is limited to 250 degrees C due to
   the silicone diaphragms, which are used for cost-efficient series
   production. The paper presents a new processing technique that was
   developed at IKV Aachen and combines the advantages of both processes.
   These particularly are a big variety of processable matrices and low
   cost equipment with a high degree of flexibility. The developed
   machinery like the new handling system, the innovative IR-heating
   station and the modified forming technique are described in detail. The
   development focuses on a temporal reduction of the thermal load of the
   diaphragms by using them only for the forming process. As a result, the
   processing temperature range has been extended from 250 degrees C to 320
   degrees C so that it is now possible to additionally process PA6, PA66
   and PPS based prepregs.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most demanding challenges in the field of audio engineering
   is the transmission of low-latency high quality audio streams over
   networks. While several protocols nowadays allow wired local network
   streaming, much effort is still required to achieve similar goals over
   existing wireless LAN technologies. While the challenge is still far
   from being solved, several design issues can be highlighted and future
   scenarios can be outlined. This paper proposes the setup of a wireless
   music production system based on open hardware and open software which
   requires relatively low setup effort while allowing for a high
   flexibility of use. The hardware platform is the Beagleboard, based on
   Texas Instruments DM3730, running a GNU/Linux OS and the computer music
   language Pure Data. Such a device can capture electric instrument audio,
   generate sound, send MIDI or OSC control data, and stream to PCs and
   other embedded devices operating as mixers, effect racks and so on,
   enabling an ecosystem of flexible and open devices. Tests conducted on a
   home wireless network show acceptable latency for many applications.}},

Abstract = {{The detection of anomalies in backbone networks is posing serious
   performance issues, not only in terms of accuracy, but also in terms of
   detection speed. Indeed current software solutions to the problem, even
   promising from the point of view of detection and false alarm rates,
   suffer from the inability of performing the required operations in real
   time, when working in high speed backbone networks. On the other hand,
   hardware solutions are based on costly and inflexible niche systems.
   To address such issues, in this paper, we propose a system based on a
   the implementation of a ``classical{''} CUSUM-based anomaly detection
   method on an open networking platform accelerator (i.e., NetFPGA). The
   objective is to combine the high performance of a hardware oriented
   solution with the flexibility of general purpose PCs.
   The experimental results, shown in the paper, clearly demonstrate that
   the proposed system is able to overcome the current software
   implementations and to operate in high-speed backbone networks.}},

Abstract = {{The high-precision and high-resolution surveying is not an easy
   question. The newest tools for those tasks are the unmanned systems,
   especially the aerial systems.
   The author built and developed a small and low-cost aerial surveying
   system, which fundamentally was based on a commercial model airplane and
   open-source hardware/firmware. The adaptation of these latter components
   allowed the semi-automatic or automatic stabilization and navigation of
   the airplane along a trajectory during surveying flights.
   The current used camera system is a small compact digital camera, which
   provides digital photographs with true-colour palette. During the
   flights, the camera was triggered automatically regarding to the
   requirements of the survey.
   With this configuration, very-high resolution photo mosaics were taken
   during several survey projects.
   This paper introduces the structure of the represented aerial system,
   especially the open-source autopilot system and some results.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory activities of analog electronic circuit undergraduate course
   at Ecole de technologie superieure (ETS) require the physical presence
   of students in groups of 2 in the laboratory to complete predefined or
   project based laboratories. This classical or traditional approach
   continuously requires big investments on laboratory equipment and
   significant space requirements. Moreover, it obliges students to be
   physically present in the laboratory to complete their experiments. The
   lab instructor is also present to help them with their needs or to
   answer their specific questions related to the experiments. With the
   evolution of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and
   electronic circuit board technologies, further possibilities even
   include to bring the laboratory at home (Lab@home). This philosophy can
   be achieved with the advantages of miniaturized and low cost equipment
   and facilities, complemented with the student's already available
   personal computers. Available miniature kits include basic electronics
   for the generation and processing of various types of signals. The
   personal computer coupled with the kit, acts as a set of signal
   injecting and measuring devices. Pedagogical strategies to encourage
   team collaborative work, ensuring simultaneous information exchanges
   between the students themselves and with the laboratory instructor can
   be elaborated specifically for this innovative setup. This recent
   approach can be used to help enforce the knowledge and competence of the
   students, allowing them to develop their autonomy, their creativity and
   thus develop their ability to innovate.
   This paper presents and further details the Lab@home approach, with its
   impacts on the students, the Professor, the lab instructor and on the
   academic institution more globally. The necessary resources, common
   challenges and difficulties, advantages and drawbacks of the approach,
   and recommendations for its implementation are also included. A Lab@home
   implementation case study is also presented at the end of this paper.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this work is to present an active and creative visualization
   method for mathematical concepts using 3D animation, modeling,
   simulation and story. The result is a first-hand experience of practical
   problems that need solutions. The method attempts to motivate
   investigation and problem solving by inviting the student to experience
   the problem itself through a creative activity.
   Although classic visualization models in mathematics involve three
   dimensional renderings and interactive animations and have proven to be
   effective in many situations, often they break down concepts into new
   concepts and then present segments to the observer. Most interactive
   models are predefined, driven by limited parameters that are available
   as a user interface. Many times we can see students wanting to use their
   creativity to interact instead of becoming the passive observer or
   operator.
   The active visualization method employs a measurable virtual 3D world
   with a time-line, a modeling tool-set and a physics simulation engine
   inside a common 3D animation package. The animation process strictly
   relies on segments controlled by non-linear function curves locked to
   time and therefore it provides an excellent ground to manipulate
   transformations without limitations even when those lead to problems.
   Students will engage in a creative activity that involves a story with a
   given goal by modeling and animating a phenomenon or group of phenomena
   that will lead to a problem they do not expect. The students will learn
   about a mathematical concept that provides the solution to their
   problem. They will integrate the concept and fix the problem to complete
   the story.
   Although there is a large number of topics and many levels of complexity
   where the method can be used at, for example modeling geometries to
   calculate volume or grouping large amounts of particles based on certain
   attributes, one of the most important elements is the storytelling that
   connects all participants.
   This work presents an example of using quaternion to adjust the rotation
   of a spaceship to change trajectory in order to fly back to the Earth.
   The spaceship will be driven to a gimbal lock in Euler angles.}},

Abstract = {{Radio interference or deliberate jamming attacks can cause highly
   unpredictable communication in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Most
   prevalent WSN platforms consist of low-cost hardware with no effective
   measures against these threats. Most proposed countermeasures require a
   more advanced hardware design or radical changes to the 802.15.4 MAC
   protocol. These alternatives can be very difficult or even impossible to
   apply to existing WSN designs. In this paper we do not attempt to change
   the hardware or the MAC protocol. Instead we investigate how WSN routing
   protocols behave when the network is affected by interference. The paper
   proposes enhancements of CTP, the de-facto tree-based routing protocol
   for WSN, using opportunistic routing. We compare our approach with a
   wide range of protocols: CTP, TYMO, MultihopLQI, broadcast and
   geographic opportunistic routing in a real-life TelosB testbed subjected
   to different interference levels. The results show that our hybrid
   protocol, O-CTP, both improves the data delivery rate and reduces the
   cost when compared to standard routing protocols.}},

   multiple discreet slits of different widths. In this paper, we detail
   the mechanical design of our variable slit mechanism, which is capable
   of positioning any one of six slits in front of the fibers immediately
   prior to injection into the spectrograph's optical train. Further, we
   present the details of related system necessary to achieve closed loop
   positioning of the slit mechanism given that no encoder is used. We also
   briefly discuss our use of open source and open hardware projects in the
   design. Finally, we describe the control system we have implemented for

Abstract = {{Integrating terrestrial and satellite communications promises several
   advantages, whereas the most evident one is that modern satellite
   networks achieve global coverage using a multiple spot beam
   architecture. In order to increase the spectral efficiency, orthogonal
   waveforms like single-carrier frequency-division multiple access
   (SC-FDMA) are investigated recently. In this paper, we verify
   experimentally that SC-FDMA waveforms taken from the 3GPP Long Term
   Evolution (LTE) standard can be transmitted reliably in the return
   channel over satellite using low-cost equipment. Mainly, we introduce an
   additional timing advance offset depending on satellite elevation and
   geographical location. And we ensure that precise information about the
   frequency offset measured in the forward channel is reused for
   compensation in the return channel at each terminal. We demonstrate in
   real-time transmission experiments over a geostationary Ku-band
   satellite that all modulation formats defined for the up-link in the LTE
   Release 8 standard can be decoded error-free. Using 16-QAM, we have
   realized a spectral efficiency of 3.2 bits/s/Hz.}},

   monitor store and forward device, with the objective of investigating
   and resolving the problems related to traditional security surveillance
   devices and video streaming over GSM (Global System for Mobile

   device with motion detection and remote control capabilities has
   successfully been designed and implemented. Both images and video were
   successfully captured using a low cost CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide
   Semiconductor) camera and this data was successfully compressed using
   low cost hardware. Motion was successfully detected with the device
   (with both good and poor lighting conditions) and compressed video files
   uploaded to a back-end server via GPRS. It was found that it is viable
   to transmit large data files over the GSM networks if the appropriate

Abstract = {{Open source hardware is a type of hardware where the schematics and
   designs are made unrestricted and available to all. They are often
   accompanied by open source software. This can bring reliability, ease of
   debugging, and modular development for rapid prototyping using
   pre-written libraries. Merits of using open source hardware are
   discussed and then applied to a portable sensor system based on the open
   hardware Arduino-derived Jeenode microcontroller board. The system uses
   an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and seamless integration of other
   sensors, including a piezo-resistive pressure sensor. It is shown that
   open source hardware can help to increase rapid development, reduce
   costs, and encourage further development.}},

Abstract = {{An open source automation system for controlling electrical appliances
   using power line communication is presented here. Control messages are
   sent over Wi-Fi network from a Wi-Fi device to the micro-controller
   which then couples the messages to the power lines. Ubiquitous power
   lines are used as physical media to transmit data over 220V/50Hz signal
   to control appliances/equipment. The data from the microcontroller is
   coupled onto the power lines using a PLC (Power Line Communication)
   modem and DCSK (Differential Code Shift Keying) modulation technique is
   employed to transmit data. Each receiver unit consists of PLC modem plus
   microcontroller and can be connected anywhere in the power line network.
   The receivers have addresses assigned to them and only respond to the
   commands sent to them by the transmitter PLC modem. The receiver unit
   controls the flow of electricity to the socket. The entire system is
   devoid of a computer to save power and make it low cost. Use of open
   source hardware, Power Line Communication and micro-controller
   collectively reduce the cost of controlling appliances remotely.}},

Abstract = {{Indoor localization is an important part of integrated AAL solutions
   providing continuous services to elderly persons. They are able to
   fulfill multiple purposes, ranging from energy saving or location based
   reminders to burglary detection. Particularly useful are combined
   systems that include localization, as well as additional services e.g.
   fall detection. Capacitive sensing systems that allow detecting the
   presence of a body over distance are a possible solution for indoor
   localization that has been used in the past. However usually the
   installation requirements are high and consequently they are expensive
   to integrate. We propose a flexible, integrated solution based on
   affordable, open-source hardware that allows indoor localization and
   fall detection specifically designed for challenges in the context of
   AAL. The system is composed of sensing mats that can be placed under
   various types of floor covering that wirelessly transmit data to a
   central platform providing localization and fall detection services to
   connected AAL platforms. The system was evaluated noncompetitive in the
   2011 EvAAL indoor localization competition.}},

Abstract = {{Urban spaces are pervaded by interpretive and reactive technologies that
   shape and are shaped by its inhabitants, with an increasingly active
   role for citizen technologists. Yet the role of domestic spaces in
   shaping lived experience within the urban environment, and subsequent
   technological interventions, is often overlooked. Homes are framed as
   closed-off environments which isolate their inhabitants from the city,
   despite being porous spaces that are also filled with ubiquitous
   computing. In this paper we draw on the participatory design and user
   innovation literatures to present the methodology for the
   ``Homesense{''} research project that explored how users design and
   develop ``smart{''} technologies within their own homes, based on the
   intersection of their concurrent urban/domestic lived experience. Kits
   of open-source hardware were used as cultural probes, and co-located
   ``lead users{''} provided technical expertise. This methodology
   demonstrates the importance of physical space and location in user-led
   domestic activities, and of combinations of technical and ``lived{''}
   expertise in developing these interventions.}},

   that improves the detection and imaging capabilities of our experimental
   system. The tailored pulse shape benefits the system by improving the
   level of signal detection after transmission through the breast and thus
   permits higher-resolution images. We report on our ability to use this
   technique to detect the presence of tumours in realistic breast phantoms
   composed of varying quantities of glandular tissue. Additionally, we
   provide a set of images based on this experimental data that

Title = {{VirtualSense: A Java-Based Open Platform for Ultra-Low-Power Wireless
   Sensor Nodes}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{Idleness has to be carefully exploited in wireless sensor networks
   (WSNs) to save power and to accumulate the energy possibly harvested
   from the environment. State-of-the-art microcontroller units provide a
   wide range of ultra-low-power inactive modes with sub-millisecond wakeup
   time that can be effectively used for this purpose. At the same time
   they are equipped with 16-bit RISC architectures clocked at tens of MHz,
   which make them powerful enough to run a Java-compatible virtual machine
   (VM). This makes it possible to bring the benefits of a virtual runtime
   environment into power-constrained embedded systems. VMs, however, risk
   to impair the effectiveness of dynamic power management as they are seen
   as always-active processes by the scheduler of the operating system in
   spite of the idleness of the threads running on top of them. Avoiding to
   keep sensor nodes busy when they could be idle is mandatory for the
   energetic sustainability of WSNs. While most of the tasks of a sensor
   node are inherently event-driven, the functioning of its
   hardware-software components is not, so that they require to be
   redesigned in order to exploit idleness. This paper presents
   VirtualSense, an open-hardware open-source ultra-low-power reactive
   wireless sensor module featuring a Java-compatible VM.}},

Abstract = {{Achieving very high localization accuracy in wireless networks that
   measure time of arrival (TOA) is a challenging task, especially when low
   cost hardware is used. The local oscillators used in the wireless nodes
   will drift over time, which will result in frequency and time offset
   between different clocks. Synchronization between the clocks must be
   maintained to obtain highly accurate TOA measurements. The delay in the
   radio frequency electronics can also vary with time and environmental
   variation and for accurate localization this variation must be accounted
   for as well. Although calibrating these parameters prior to the
   operation of the network is one solution, it is not an option for
   networks that operate for longer periods of time or those that are
   rapidly deployed. In this paper we propose an algorithm that jointly
   tracks the frequency offset and radio delay of all the nodes in the
   network along with the location of the mobile nodes. The algorithm
   calculates the round trip delay measurements, which eliminates the need
   to estimate the time offset. We also derive the posterior Cramer Rao
   lower bound (PCRLB) for the joint estimation problem, which provides a
   bound on the maximum performance achievable. Through simulations we show
   that the performance of the proposed algorithm is in close agreement
   with the PCRLB for both the non-kinematic and kinematic state
   estimation.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a high-performance, low-cost system for control and
   characterization of MEMS rate and rate-integrating gyroscopes and other
   resonant sensors. MEMS gyroscopes, some accelerometers and clocks
   utilize mechanical resonators. High-quality factor, low-frequency
   resonator devices with damping time constants from seconds to several
   minutes pose special characterization challenges. The proposed system
   uses the commercial ``USRP{''} software defined radio (SDR) hardware and
   open source GnuRadio software as a platform for the proposed
   characterization and control system. For characterization of resonators,
   we developed software to perform dual channel swept-frequency gain-phase
   analysis, impulse response real-time spectral analysis, and ring down
   testing which achieve performance comparable to dedicated commercial
   hardware. To highlight the capabilities of the characterization tools,
   we implemented an automatic mode matching algorithm in the software. The
   same hardware is used for control of gyroscopes in either rate or rate
   integrating modes. We present here two control schemes; a rate-only
   control implemented entirely in the FPGA of a USRP1, and a hybrid
   software/firmware control which is capable of rate and rate-integrating
   operation. Experimental results of characterization, automatic tuning
   and rate-mode operation of a rate and rate-integrating MEMS gyroscope
   are presented to demonstrate the viability of the proposed system.}},

Abstract = {{As main memory systems begin to face the scaling challenges from DRAM
   technology, future computer systems need to adapt to the emerging memory
   technologies like Phase-Change Memory (PCM or PRAM). While these newer
   technologies offer advantages such as storage density, non-volatility,
   and low energy consumption, they are constrained by limited write
   endurance that becomes more pronounced with process variation. In this
   paper, we propose a novel PRAM-based main memory system, RePRAM
   (Recycling PRAM), which leverages a group of faulty pages and recycles
   them in a managed way to significantly extend the PRAM lifetime while
   minimizing the performance impact. In particular, we explore two
   different dimensions of dynamic redundancy levels and group sizes, and
   design low-cost hardware and software support for RePRAM. Our proposed
   scheme involves minimal hardware modifications (that have less than 1\%
   on-chip and off-chip area overheads). Also, our schemes can improve the
   PRAM lifetime by up to 43x (times) over a chip with no error correction
   capabilities, and outperform prior schemes such as DRM and ECP at a
   small fraction of the hardware cost. The performance overhead resulting
   from our scheme is less than 7\% on average across 21 applications from
   SPEC2006, Splash-2, and PARSEC benchmark suites.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose hPIN/hTAN, a low-cost hardware token based
   PIN/TAN system for protecting e-banking systems against the strong
   threat model where the adversary has full control over the user's
   computer. This threat model covers various kinds of attacks related to
   untrusted terminal computers, such as keyloggers, screen scrapers,
   session hijackers, Trojan horses and transaction generators.
   The core of hPIN/hTAN is a secure and easy user-computer-token
   interface. The security is guaranteed by the user-computer-token
   interface and two underlying security protocols for
   user/server/transaction authentication. The hPIN/hTAN system is designed
   as an open framework so that the underlying authentication protocols can
   be easily re-configured. To minimize the costs and maximize usability,
   we chose two security protocols dependent on simple cryptography (a
   cryptographic hash function).
   In contrast to other hardware-based solutions, hPIN/hTAN depends on
   neither a second trusted channel nor a secure keypad nor external
   trusted center. Our prototype implementation does not involve
   cryptography beyond a cryptographic hash function. The minimalistic
   design can also help increase security because more complicated systems
   tend to have more security holes. As an important feature, hPIN/hTAN
   exploits human users' active involvement in the whole process to
   compensate security weaknesses caused by careless human behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The United States is suffering from an aging civil infrastructure
   crisis. Key to recovery are rapid inspection technologies like that
   being investigated by the VOTERS project (Versatile Onboard Traffic
   Embedded Roaming Sensors), which aims to outfit ordinary road vehicles
   with compact low-cost hardware that enables them to rapidly assess and
   report the condition of roadways and bridge decks free of driver
   interaction.
   A key piece of hardware, and the focus of this paper, is a 24 GHz
   millimeter-wave radar system that measures the reflectivity of pavement
   surfaces. To account for the variability of real-world driving, such as
   changes in height, angle, speed, and temperature, a sensor fusion
   approach is used that corrects MWR measurements based on data from four
   additional sensors. The corrected MWR measurements are expected to be
   useful for various characterization applications, including: material
   type; deterioration such as cracks and potholes; and surface coverage
   conditions such as dry, wet, oil, water, and ice.
   Success at each of these applications is an important step towards
   achieving the VOTERS objective, however, this paper focuses on surface
   coverage, as whatever covers the driving surface will be most apparent
   to the MWR sensor and if not accounted for could significantly limit the
   accuracy of other applications. Contributions of the paper include
   findings from static lab tests, which validate the approach and show the
   effects of height and angle. Further contributions come from lab and
   in-field dynamic tests, which show the effects of speed and demonstrate
   that the MWR approach is accurate under city driving conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Future microprocessors need low-cost solutions for reliable operation in
   the presence of failure-prone devices. A promising approach is to detect
   hardware faults by deploying low-cost monitors of software-level
   symptoms of such faults. Recently, researchers have shown these
   mechanisms work well, but there remains a non-negligible risk that
   several faults may escape the symptom detectors and result in silent
   data corruptions (SDCs).
   Most prior evaluations of symptom-based detectors perform fault
   injection campaigns on application benchmarks, where each run simulates
   the impact of a fault injected at a hardware site at a certain point in
   the application's execution (application fault site). Since the total
   number of application fault sites is very large (trillions for standard
   benchmark suites), it is not feasible to study all possible faults.
   Previous work therefore typically studies a randomly selected sample of
   faults. Such studies do not provide any feedback on the portions of the
   application where faults were not injected. Some of those instructions
   may be vulnerable to SDCs, and identifying them could allow protecting
   them through other means if needed.
   This paper presents Relyzer, an approach that systematically analyzes
   all application fault sites and carefully picks a small subset to
   perform selective fault injections for transient faults. Relyzer employs
   novel fault pruning techniques that prune faults that need detailed
   study by either predicting their outcomes or showing them equivalent to
   other faults. We find that Relyzer prunes about 99.78\% of the total
   faults across twelve applications studied here, reducing the faults that
   require detailed simulation by 3 to 5 orders of magnitude for most of
   the applications. Fault injection simulations on the remaining faults
   can identify SDC causing faults in the entire application. Some of
   Relyzer's techniques rely on heuristics to determine fault equivalence.
   Our validation efforts show that Relyzer determines fault outcomes with
   96\% accuracy, averaged across all the applications studied here.}},

Abstract = {{Violation of CITES regulations in tropical timber trade necessitates the
   development of accurate species identification systems. The application
   of available methods, mostly based on visual illustrations and
   descriptions of wood anatomical characteristics, proved to be difficult
   or even impossible, particularly on lower taxonomic levels. Further,
   because most of the chain-of-custody documents are externally applied
   marks which can easily be manipulated, control methods should be based
   on wood features which are inherent in the wood itself. In a case study
   on five closely-related genera of the Meliaceae (mahogany) family,
   including Swietenia sp. (listed on CITES appendix II), Khaya,
   Entandrophragma, and Carapa sp. (legal trade timbers), this study
   demonstrates the process of developing DNA markers for identification
   purposes. A detailed sequence analysis of several non-coding cpDNA
   regions resulted in an assay of seven genus-specific SNP (single
   nucleotide polymorphism) markers. Tools have been designed that could be
   applied with low-cost equipment on the basis of PCR-RFLPs without the
   need for sequencing or capillary electrophoresis techniques. In
   addition, the application of the method to wood material with degraded
   DNA of low overall quantity is highlighted.}},

Abstract = {{Extreme CMOS scaling is expected to significantly impact the reliability
   of future microprocessors, prompting recent research effort on low-cost
   hardware-software cross-layer reliability solutions. To evaluate,
   statistical fault injection (SFI) is often used to estimate the error
   coverage of the underlying method. Unfortunately, because a significant
   number of errors injected by SFI are often derated, the evaluation
   becomes less rigorous and less efficient. T his paper makes the
   observation that many derated errors can be gracefully avoided to allow
   the fault injection campaign to focus on likely non-derated faults that
   stress the method-under-test. We propose a biased injection framework
   called CriticalFault that employs vulnerability analysis to map out
   relevant faults for stress testing. With CriticalFault, our results show
   that the injection space is reduced by 29 \% and 59 \% of the biased
   injections cause either software aborts or silent data corruptions, both
   are improvements from SFI. Moreover, we characterize different
   propagation behaviors of these non-derated faults and discuss the
   implications of designing future cross-layer solutions. Overall, not
   only CriticalFault is highly effective in identifying relevant test
   cases for current systems, but reliability researchers and engineers can
   also conduct more in-depth and meaningful analysis in deveoping future
   reliability solutions using CriticalFault.}},

Abstract = {{The sharing of the wireless spectrum is a major concern of network
   administrators. Access points in the same network interfere with each
   other, degrading the aggregate performance of stations. Moreover,
   wireless networks usually coexist with others applications that share
   the same spectrum and negatively impact the packet transmission. To
   overcome these issues, we propose the channel allocation algorithm
   designed for central controllers of infra-structured IEEE 802.11
   networks. Our algorithm reduces the interference in controlled access
   points through the dynamic choice of their operating channels and,
   unlike other proposals, was designed to operate in a network composed of
   low cost devices from different brands, and open source software.
   Furthermore, we also consider the interference caused by unmanaged
   networks, adjusting the settings of the managed access points according
   to the wireless environment. The proposal was implemented and evaluated
   in an open testbed, and the results show that our controller efficiently
   manages the spectrum with low cost equipment and a low complexity
   algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Biodiesel is an evolution in the attempt to substitute diesel oil by
   biomass. The aim of this paper is show the development of the method to
   monitor the transesterification reaction ``in line of process{''} using
   the ultrasound technique. The materials used in this study were degummed
   soybean oil, methanol and ethanol and potassium hydroxide (KOH). Two
   catalytic routes were tested, both of them using soybean oil and KOH, as
   catalyser. The difference between them was the alcohol used (methanol
   and ethanol). The test was carried out in batch without heating, and
   with stirring. The results showed that the time of flight, as well as
   the echo amplitude, present different behaviours depending on the type
   of alcohol used. Although the study is still in progress, preliminary
   results suggest that the proposed method may be feasible to monitor the
   reactions of biodiesel during its fabrication, in real time and with
   relatively low cost equipment.}},

Title = {{Small scale spatial heterogeneity of Normalized Difference Vegetation
   Indices (NDVIs) and hot spots of photosynthesis in biological soil
   crusts}},
Journal = {{FLORA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{207}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{159-167}},
Abstract = {{Normalized Difference Vegetation Indices (NDVIs) are typically
   determined using satellite or airborne remote sensing, or field portable
   spectrometers, which give an averaged signal on centimetre to metre
   scale plots. Biological soil crust (BSC) patches may have smaller sizes,
   and ecophysiological, hydrological as well as pedological processes may
   be heterogeneously distributed within this level of resolution. A
   ground-based NDVI imaging procedure using low-cost equipment (Olympus
   Camedia 5000z digital camera equipped with a Hoya R72 infrared filter)
   was developed in this study to fill this gap at the level of field
   research, where carrying costly and bulky equipment to remote locations
   is often the limiting factor for data collection. Method principle and
   field data are presented, and the field experiment was deepened
   comparing NDVI measurements and CO2 turnover of soil crust samples in
   the laboratory, backing the reliability of the approach.
   A commercially available colour rendition chart with known red (600-700
   nm) and NIR (800-900 nm) reflectances was placed into each scene and
   used for calibration purposes on a per-image basis. Generation of NDVI
   images involved (i) determination of red and NIR reflectances from the
   pixel values of the red and NIR channels, respectively, and (ii)
   calculation and imaging of the NDVI, where NDVI values of 1 to +1 were
   mapped to grey values of 0 to 255. The correlation between NDVI values
   retrieved from these images and NDVI values determined using field
   spectrometry was close (r(2)=0.91), the 95\% confidence interval
   amounted to 0.10 NDVI units. The pixel resolution was 0.8 mm in the
   field and 0.2 mm in the laboratory, but can still be improved
   significantly with closer distance to the crust or with higher camera
   resolution. NDVI values obtained using the new method were related to
   the net CO2 uptake of BSCs, where both slope and correlation coefficient
   of the respective regression function conformed with literature data.
   Geostatistical analysis revealed that both spatial variability of net
   CO2 uptake as well as size of individual hot spots of this parameter
   increased with crust development. The latter never exceeded 4 mm in the
   investigated crusts, which points to the necessity of high resolution
   imaging for linking remote sensing with ecophysiology. Perspectively,
   the new method could be used for field monitoring of both biological
   soil crusts and vascular vegetation. (c) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

Abstract = {{The availability of low-cost hardware coupled with the advancement of
   VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) technology has promoted the
   development of wireless multimedia sensor network (WMSN). However, the
   strict constraints in terms of processing power, storage, bandwidth etc.
   pose a great challenge to data processing in WMSN. Transmitting raw data
   is very costly while limited processing power prevents sophisticated
   multimedia processing. Exploring low-overhead data compression technique
   is a solution towards this problem. In this paper we propose an
   energy-saving audio data compression technique for WMSN combining
   wavelet lifting with a newly proposed difference detection technique. We
   consider the application domain where data are co-related. To exploit
   this co-relation we propose to run one wavelet round followed by a
   dynamic number of difference round and thereby, local communication
   overhead is saved compared to pure wavelet based scheme without
   sacrificing the target of sending data with less number of bits to the
   sink. Moreover, in addition to capturing spatial correlation by wavelet,
   this scheme captures temporal correlation by introducing the difference
   detection round.
   Performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated through simulation where
   efficacy of the scheme is not only evaluated in terms of energy
   consumption but also by computing SNR. The scheme is compared with one
   of the existing schemes. The results confirm our scheme's supremacy over
   the competing scheme both in terms of energy saving and signal
   reconstruction quality (SNR).}},

Abstract = {{This work proposes Pointy, a software assisted hardware pointer
   prefetcher for Java applications. Pointy exploits the strengths of both
   software and hardware. Its runtime software component communicates
   points-to relationships between objects to the underlying hardware. This
   points-to information is maintained and tracked in any managed runtime
   that implements automatic garbage collection. Pointy stores the object
   connectivity information in a separate hardware structure and uses it to
   generate timely pointer prefetches. To achieve a low-cost hardware
   implementation, Pointy spills the object metadata to the conventional
   memory hierarchy and retrieves it only when needed. Taking advantage of
   its hybrid design, Pointy can selectively communicate points-to metadata
   to the hardware based on class profiling that is readily available at
   the runtime level, while impractical to extract at the hardware level.
   pointer intensive benchmarks even in the presence of conventional
   prefetchers. When used in conjunction with traditional prefetchers, such
   as striding and next line, Pointy improves application performance by
   53\% for SpecJBB 2005 and by 72\% on averagel, which represents a
   speedup of 19\% and 18\%, respectively, compared to traditional

   periurban areas lacking centralized water supplies have been evaluated.
   The technologies use generally simple and low-cost equipment that can
   easily be handled and maintained by the local population. Experiences
   comprise coagulation/filtration with iron and aluminum salts,
   scaled-down for small community-and household-scale-applications,
   adsorption techniques using low-cost arsenic sorbents, such as
   geological materials (clays, laterites, soils, limestones), natural
   organic-based sorbents (natural biomass), and synthetic materials, use
   of constructed wetlands with native perennial plants for arsenic
   rhizofiltration, capacitive deionization, zerovalent iron especially
   using nanoparticles and solar technologies including titanium
   dioxide-heterogeneous photocatalysis.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time monitoring of natural disasters, mass events, and large
   accidents with airborne optical sensors is an ongoing topic in research
   and development. Airborne monitoring is used as a complemental data
   source with the advantage of flexible data acquisition and higher
   spatial resolution compared to optical satellite data. In cases of
   disasters or mass events, optical high resolution image data received
   directly after acquisition are highly welcomed by security related
   organizations like police and rescue forces. Low-cost optical camera
   systems are suitable for real-time applications as the accuracy
   requirements can be lowered in return for faster processing times. In
   this paper, the performance of low-cost camera systems for real-time
   mapping applications is exemplarily evaluated based on already existing
   sensor systems operated at German Aerospace Center (DLR). Focus lies
   next to the geometrical and radiometric performance on the real time
   processing chain which includes image processors, thematic processors
   for automatic traffic extraction and automatic person tracking, data
   downlink to the ground station, and further processing and distribution
   on the ground. Finally, a concept for a national airborne rapid mapping
   service based on the low-cost hardware is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the development and testing of an open and flexible
   embedded system applied to positioning and telecontrol (OFESAPO) for
   outdoor applications. The system is composed of a control center (CC)
   and a set of remote terminal units (RTUs); the International
   Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 60870-5 series has been chosen for
   communication among them. This is a standard protocol of real-time
   telecontrol applications. The CC is a personal computer, and the RTUs
   are based on open hardware and software. The RTU hardware is an embedded
   system, i.e., a system-on-chip-type design using field-programmable gate
   array that has been programmed with the open-core LEON running Linux
   operating system. For prototyping, the GR-XC3S-1500 board has been used.
   As there is no open source code available for the IEC standard
   protocols, an open source code has also been implemented. Hence, both
   the hardware and the software are open source in OFESAPO. Several tests
   have been made to show the system's limitations and the suitability for
   real-time applications. A prototype has also been tested in a real
   environment, where the real position of two moving RTUs was shown by a
   CC using Google Map.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time multichannel neuronal signal recording has spawned broad
   applications in neuro-prostheses and neuro-rehabilitation. Detecting and
   discriminating neuronal spikes from multiple spike trains in real-time
   require significant computational efforts and present major challenges
   for hardware design in terms of hardware area and power consumption.
   This paper presents a Hebbian eigenfilter spike sorting algorithm, in
   which principal components analysis (PCA) is conducted through Hebbian
   learning. The eigenfilter eliminates the need of computationally
   expensive covariance analysis and eigenvalue decomposition in
   traditional PCA algorithms and, most importantly, is amenable to low
   cost hardware implementation. Scalable and efficient hardware
   architectures for real-time multichannel spike sorting are also
   presented. In addition, folding techniques for hardware sharing are
   proposed for better utilization of computing resources among multiple
   channels. The throughput, accuracy and power consumption of our Hebbian
   eigenfilter are thoroughly evaluated through synthetic and real spike
   trains. The proposed Hebbian eigenfilter technique enables real-time
   multichannel spike sorting, and leads the way towards the next
   generation of motor and cognitive neuro-prosthetic devices.}},

Abstract = {{For the low-cost hardware-based intrusion detection systems, this paper
   proposes a memory-efficient parallel string matching scheme. In order to
   reduce the number of state transitions, the finite state machine tiles
   in a string matcher adopt bit-level input symbols. Long target patterns
   are divided into subpatterns with a fixed length; deterministic finite
   automata are built with the subpatterns. Using the pattern dividing, the
   variety of target pattern lengths can be mitigated, so that memory usage
   in homogeneous string matchers can be efficient. In order to identify
   each original long pattern being divided, a two-stage sequential
   matching scheme is proposed for the successive matches with subpatterns.
   Experimental results show that total memory requirements decrease on
   average by 47.8 percent and 62.8 percent for Snort and ClamAV rule sets,
   in comparison with several existing bit-split string matching methods.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel method for ultrasonic range estimation. The
   method uses a wideband frequency-hop spread spectrum ultrasonic signal
   to increase robustness to noise and reverberation. The method applies
   cross-correlation with earliest peak search and a novel minimum variance
   search technique to correct the error in the cross-correlation
   time-of-flight estimate to within one wavelength of the carrier before
   applying a phase-shift technique for subwavelength range refinement. The
   method can be implemented digitally in software and only requires
   low-cost hardware for signal transmission and acquisition. Experimental
   results show an accuracy of better than 0.5 mm in a typical office
   environment.}},

Title = {{Speed estimation of vehicles approaching an intersection: a digital

Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{59}},

Abstract = {{Most severe car accidents that occur in urban environments involve side
   impacts at street intersections, even at those regulated with traffic
   lights. Hence, it is very common to implement a small delay since one
   road changes to red until the other road changes to green. This delay is
   intended to avoid accidents in which a vehicle decides to go through the
   intersection after the sequence green-yellow-red is started,
   underestimating the time required to overtake the intersection. A better
   approach is to adjust the delay dynamically, depending on the speed of
   the vehicles approaching to the intersection. Using the dynamic
   approach, it is possible to improve traffic flow by reducing unnecessary
   delays, and to improve safety by applying longer delays when needed.
   This paper proposes a speed estimation method based on digital image
   processing of pictures taken with wireless cameras installed on top of
   existing traffic lights. The algorithm finds a vehicle in two
   consecutive images (either in day or night condition) and computes its
   speed by correlation. When a traffic light turns red, the systems
   estimates the speed of the cars approaching and decides to change the
   other road to green immediately, or to wait until it is safe to do so.
   The system was tested with real traffic flow at a street located in the
   city of Talavera de la Reina, Spain, with vehicles at different speeds.
   The image processing method proved to be accurate for this application,
   and adding the advantage of low cost equipment and easy installation
   results in a very attractive solution.}},

Abstract = {{Although potentiostats are the foundation of modern electrochemical
   research, they have seen relatively little application in resource poor
   settings, such as undergraduate laboratory courses and the developing
   world. One reason for the low penetration of potentiostats is their
   cost, as even the least expensive commercially available laboratory
   potentiostats sell for more than one thousand dollars. An inexpensive
   electrochemical workstation could thus prove useful in educational labs,
   and increase access to electrochemistry-based analytical techniques for
   food, drug and environmental monitoring. With these motivations in mind,
   we describe here the CheapStat, an inexpensive (<\$80), open-source
   (software and hardware), hand-held potentiostat that can be constructed
   by anyone who is proficient at assembling circuits. This device supports
   a number of potential waveforms necessary to perform cyclic, square
   wave, linear sweep and anodic stripping voltammetry. As we demonstrate,
   it is suitable for a wide range of applications ranging from food-and
   drug-quality testing to environmental monitoring, rapid DNA detection,
   and educational exercises. The device's schematics, parts lists, circuit
   board layout files, sample experiments, and detailed assembly
   instructions are available in the supporting information and are

Abstract = {{Semisolid metal processing (SSP) is recognized as a new near-shape
   forming technology, which combines the merits of both the liquid and the
   solid metal processing. Compared with the traditional rolling process,
   this technology has the features of low energy consumption, low cost
   equipment and high yield. Perhaps inevitably, a problem is the solid and
   liquid phases tend to separate with each other during rheo-rolling
   process, especially when the semisolid slurry has a low solid fraction.
   This problem causes macrosegregation and reduces the quality of the
   strip. Using rectangular groove roller may solve this problem. In this
   paper, numerical simulation method and experiment were combined for
   simulation and optimization of thermal field during continuous
   constrained rheo-rolling of AZ31 alloy. The results show that on the
   sloping plate surface, alloy temperature decreases gradually from the
   casting mouth to the exit with a linear pattern, the alloy temperature
   near the sloping plate surface is lower than that on the above surface,
   when the casting temperature is higher than 690 degrees C, the melt
   temperature at the exit of the plate is higher than the liquidus of AZ31
   alloy, which will cause product fracture. In the backward slip zone,
   semisolid metal deformation mainly happens, alloy temperature decreases
   gradually from the entrance to the exit of the roll gap, semisolid zone
   length increases with the casting temperature, isothermal lines have
   twice buckling, the buckling direction on the surface of the alloy is
   toward the exit of the roll gap, while the buckling direction in the
   center is toward the entrance of the roll gap, and their bending degree
   increases gradually from neutral flow plane to the entrance of the roll
   gap. In the forward slip zone, solid metal deformation mainly takes
   place, isothermal lines have once buckling, and the buckling direction
   is toward the exit of the gap. Under the current experimental
   conditions, the proper casting temperature between 670 and 690 degrees C
   is suggested.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents efficient vision-based finger detection, tracking,
   and event identification techniques and a low-cost hardware framework
   for multi-touch sensing and display applications. The proposed approach
   uses a fast bright-blob segmentation process based on automatic
   multilevel histogram thresholding to extract the pixels of touch blobs
   obtained from scattered infrared lights captured by a video camera. The
   advantage of this automatic multilevel thresholding approach is its
   robustness and adaptability when dealing with various ambient lighting
   conditions and spurious infrared noises. To extract the connected
   components of these touch blobs, a connected-component analysis
   procedure is applied to the bright pixels acquired by the previous
   stage. After extracting the touch blobs from each of the captured image
   frames, a blob tracking and event recognition process analyzes the
   spatial and temporal information of these touch blobs from consecutive
   frames to determine the possible touch events and actions performed by
   users. This process also refines the detection results and corrects for
   errors and occlusions caused by noise and errors during the blob
   extraction process. The proposed blob tracking and touch event
   recognition process includes two phases. First, the phase of blob
   tracking associates the motion correspondence of blobs in succeeding
   frames by analyzing their spatial and temporal features. The touch event
   recognition process can identify meaningful touch events based on the
   motion information of touch blobs, such as finger moving, rotating,
   pressing, hovering, and clicking actions. Experimental results
   demonstrate that the proposed vision-based finger detection, tracking,
   and event identification system is feasible and effective for
   multi-touch sensing applications in various operational environments and
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{While multicore processors promise large performance benefits for

   identify the source of the extra misses, but also perform the tricky
   task of determining if the misses are caused by interthread
   communication (i.e., coherence misses) and if so, whether they are
   caused by true or false sharing (since the solutions for these two are
   quite different).
   In this article, we propose a new programmer-centric definition of false
   sharing misses and describe our novel algorithm to perform coherence
   miss classification. We contrast our approach with existing data-centric
   definitions of false sharing. A straightforward implementation of our
   algorithm is too expensive to be incorporated in real hardware.
   Therefore, we explore the design space for low-cost hardware support
   that can classify coherence misses on-the-fly into true and false
   sharing misses, allowing existing performance counters and profiling
   tools to expose and attribute them. We find that our approximate schemes
   achieve good accuracy at only a fraction of the cost of the ideal
   scheme. Additionally, we demonstrate the usefulness of our work in a
   case study involving a real application.}},

   several selectable CPU cores by using Intel's OpenMP library. But if one
   applies this feature to a numerical simulation based on a boundary

   memory of such a system. So, if a low-cost hardware should be
   effectively used for large BEM problems, a memory compression algorithm
   that is easy to be scheduled in parallel is of first choice. Within our
   development of the Hierarchical Block Wavelet Compression, this bottle
   neck will be tackled in pure mathematical manners. Furthermore, its
   parallelization will be discussed and an optimal compression by varying
   the compression rate over different areas of the BEM problem will be

Abstract = {{Light-trails (LTs) have been proposed as a solution for optical
   networking to provide support for emerging services such as
   video-on-demand, pseudo-wires, data-centers, etc. To provision these
   services we require features such as dynamic bandwidth provisioning,
   optical multicasting, sub-wavelength grooming and a low-cost hardware
   platform-all of which are available through the LT concept.
   Architectural, performance, resilience and implementation studies of LTs
   have led to consideration of this technology in metropolitan networks.
   In the area of architecture and performance, significant literature is
   available in terms of static network optimization. An area that has not
   yet been considered and which is of service provider importance (from an
   implementation perspective) is the stochastic behavior and dynamic
   growth of the LT virtual topology. In this paper, we propose a two-stage
   scheduling algorithm that efficiently allocates bandwidth to nodes
   within a LT and also grows the virtual topology of LTs based on basic
   utility theory. The algorithm facilitates growth of the LT topology
   fathoming across all the necessary and sufficient parameters. The
   algorithm is formally stated, analyzed using Markov models and verified
   through simulations, resulting in 45\% betterment over existing linear
   program (LP) or heuristic models. The outcome of the growth algorithm is
   an autonomic optical network that suffices for service provider needs
   while lowering operational and capital costs. This paper presents the
   first work in the area of dual topology planning-at the level of
   connections as well as at the level of the network itself.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a high-accuracy, multirate inertial navigation
   system (INS) integrating global positioning system (GPS) measurements
   and advanced vector aiding techniques for precise position and attitude
   estimation of autonomous surface crafts (ASCs). Designed to be
   implemented and tested in the DELFIMx catamaran developed at ISR/IST,
   the navigation system comprises an advanced inertial integration
   algorithm to account for coning and sculling motions, combined with an
   extended Kalman filter (EKF) for inertial sensor error compensation.
   Aiding gravitational observations are optimally exploited in the EKF, by
   deriving a sensor integration technique that takes into account the
   vehicle's dynamics bandwidth information to properly trace measurement
   disturbances and extract the relevant sensor information. The proposed
   aiding technique and the performance of the navigation system are
   assessed using experimental data obtained at seatrials with a low-cost
   hardware architecture installed on-board the DELFIMx platform. It is
   shown that the low frequency information embodied in pendular
   measurements improves the compensation of inertial sensor bias and
   noise, and consequently enhances the performance of position and
   attitude estimation. The overall improvements obtained with the vector
   aiding observations are also illustrated for the case of GPS signal
   outage, emphasizing the extended autonomy of the navigation system with
   respect to position aiding.}},

   Communication between a mobile smart-phone and the spirometer is
   implemented using the popular personal area network standard

   plots the received signal and displays the flow measurement application
   software running on the client mobile phone itself, where the plot can
   be captured and saved as an image before transmission. The acquired
   signal is transmitted via the Bluetooth to the processing and diagnostic
   unit with wireless protocol between sensors and the electronics board.

Abstract = {{Although membrane proteins are ubiquitous within all living organisms
   and represent the majority of drug targets, a general method for direct,
   label-free measurement of ligand binding to native membranes has not

   accurately quantify ligand-receptor binding affinities in a variety of
   membrane environments. By detecting minute changes in the refractive
   index of a solution, BSI allows binding interactions of proteins with
   their ligands to be measured at picomolar concentrations. Equilibrium
   binding constants in the micromolar to picomolar range were obtained for
   small-and large-molecule interactions in both synthetic and cell-derived
   membranes without the use of labels or supporting substrates. The simple
   and low-cost hardware, high sensitivity and label-free nature of BSI
   should make it readily applicable to the study of many
   membrane-associated proteins of biochemical and pharmacological

Abstract = {{Semisolid metal forming (SSF) is recognized as a new forming technology,
   which has been paid more and more attention by the researchers all over
   the world. The semisolid rolling process (rheo-rolling) combines the
   fabrication of semisolid slurry with continuously rolling as an
   important neoteric means to achieve near-shape forming. Compared with
   the traditional rolling process, this technology has the features of
   short machining process, low energy consumption, low cost equipment and
   high yield. However, one of the difficulties of using this technology to
   produce strip is that the solid and liquid phases prone to separation
   with each other during rheo-rolling deformation, especially when the
   semisolid slurry has a low solid fraction. The phenomenon causes
   macrosegregation and reduces the quality of the strip, as a result,
   limiting its industrial application. Using rectangular groove roller may
   solve this problem. In this paper, the mathematical model of unit
   rolling pressure distribution in rectangular groove during rheo-rolling
   was established. AZ91D magnesium alloy was taken as an example, and the
   effects of rolling strip thickness, width and roller radius on unit
   pressure were calculated and studied. The calculation results reveal
   that the smaller the thickness of rheo-rolled strip is, the narrower the
   width is, the bigger the peak unit rolling pressure is and the larger
   the average unit rolling pressure is However, when the strip thickness
   decreases, the peak unit rolling pressure moves towards the exit while
   when width decreases, the peak unit rolling pressure moves towards the
   entrance. The larger the roller radius is, the bigger the peak unit
   rolling pressure is, the larger the average unit rolling pressure is,
   and the peak value deviates towards the exit.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a low-cost wireless sensor network platform,
   called wireless ad hoc system for positioning (WASP), that has been
   developed for high-accuracy localization and tracking. This platform
   uses the time of arrival (TOA) of beacon signals periodically
   transmitted by the nodes at known times for localization. The system was
   designed to have a unique tradeoff between hardware complexity and
   processing complexity to provide high accuracy at minimal cost in
   complex radio propagation environments. To enable the system to perform
   well in realistic environments, it was also necessary to develop novel
   extensions to existing algorithms for the measurement of TOA,
   localization, and tracking. In this paper, we describe the architecture,
   hardware, and algorithms of WASP and present results based on field
   trials conducted in different radio propagation environments. The
   results show that WASP achieves a ranging accuracy of 0.15 m outdoors
   and 0.5 m indoors when around 12 anchor nodes are used. These accuracies
   are achieved with operating range of up to 200 m outdoors and 30 m
   indoors. This compares favorably to other published results for systems
   operating in realistic environments.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we describe the implementation of a Linux extension board
   for the e-puck educational mobile robot, designed to enhance the
   computation, memory and networking performance of the robot at very low
   cost. The extension board is based on a 32-bit ARM9 microprocessor and
   provides wireless network support. The ARM9 extension board runs in
   parallel with the dsPIC microprocessor on the e-puck motherboard with
   communication between the two via an SPI bus. The extension board is
   designed to handle computationally intensive image processing, wireless
   communication and high-level intelligent robot control algorithms, while
   the dsPIC handles low-level sensor interfacing, data processing and
   motor control. The extension board runs an embedded Linux operating
   system, along with a Debian-based port of the root file system stored in
   a Micro SD card. The extended e-puck robot platform requires minimal
   effort to integrate the well-known open-source robot control framework
   Player and, when placed within a TCP/IP networked infrastructure,
   provides a powerful and flexible platform for experimental swarm

Abstract = {{Randomness extractors are important tools in cryptography. Their goal is
   to compress a high-entropy source into a more uniform output. Beyond
   their theoretical interest, they have recently gained attention because
   of their use in the design and proof of leakage-resilient primitives,
   such as stream ciphers and pseudorandom functions. However, for these
   proofs of leakage resilience to be meaningful in practice, it is
   important to instantiate and implement the components they are based on.
   In this context, while numerous works have investigated the
   implementation properties of block ciphers such as the AES Rijndael,
   very little is known about the application of side-channel attacks
   against extractor implementations. In order to close this gap, this
   paper instantiates a low-cost hardware extractor and analyzes it both
   from a performance and from a side-channel security point of view. Our
   investigations lead to contrasted conclusions. On the one hand,
   extractors can be efficiently implemented and protected with masking. On
   the other hand, they provide adversaries with many more exploitable
   leakage samples than, e.g. block ciphers. As a result, they can ensure
   high security margins against standard (non-profiled) side-channel
   attacks and turn out to be much weaker against profiled attacks. From a
   methodological point of view, our analysis consequently raises the
   question of which attack strategies should be considered in security
   evaluations.}},

   investigate traffic routing in multihop, multiradio meshed networks with
   mobile users. We consider an environment where a user connects to
   different infrastructure mesh nodes as it moves, and we compare the
   performance of state-of-the-art routing protocols, namely, OLSR,
   OLSR-ETX, B.A.T.M.A.N and our modified version of this protocol, called
   sw-B.A.T.M.A.N. Our experimental measurements show that sw-B.A.T.M.A.N
   outperforms the other protocols, ensuring a seamless connectivity in
   presence of MPEG video streaming, with and without background traffic.}},

Abstract = {{Most mechanical engineering curricula include courses in system
   dynamics, controls, mechatronics, and vibrations, but these courses
   often do not have a laboratory component. Even if there is such a
   component, laboratory access is often limited, and thus there is a need
   to increase students' laboratory experience. This paper addresses the
   development and testing of instructional material in the form of
   take-home hardware kits and software that can be used to perform control
   system experiments at home. The students are given a compact, low-cost
   hardware kit and software with which they can perform an experiment at
   home using only their PC/laptop. The kit consists of three components.
   These are: a hardware interface board which interfaces with the
   student's PC and with the experiment hardware, a Windows-based user
   interface program that the students download to their computer, and the
   experimental setup. Five experiments have been developed. Here we report
   on two of these experiments that involve control systems: a DC
   motor/tachometer system and a heater/temperature sensor system.
   Administration of the kits in several mechanical engineering courses has
   shown that the kits were effective in improving student understanding of
   key concepts.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic operation of gas sensors has been shown to improve selectivity
   as well as stability, especially for metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) gas
   sensors. Two methods that were studied extensively are temperature
   cycled operation (TCO)(1) and electrical impedance spectroscopy
   (EIS)(2). We propose to combine both methods in one system in order to
   increase the selectivity further, but also to allow a self-monitoring
   approach by making use of the inherent redundancy in the data obtained
   by both methods. In order to apply both methods in real applications, a
   suitable low cost hardware is needed especially for EIS. We have studied
   a novel approach for EIS based on a single FPGA for digital, broad
   spectrum stimulation of the gas sensor and a high-speed ADC for
   recording the sensor response in the time domain.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays validation of anti-lock braking systems(ABS) relies mainly on a
   large amount of road tests. An alternative means with higher efficiency
   is employing the hardware-in-the-loop simulation(HILS) system to
   substitute part of road tests for designing, testing, and tuning
   electronic control units(ECUs) of ABS. Most HILS systems for ABS use
   expensive digital signal processor hardware and special purpose
   software, and some fail-safe functions with regard to wheel speeds
   cannot be evaluated since artificial wheel speed signals are usually
   provided. In this paper, a low-cost ABS HILS test bench is developed and
   used for validating the anti-lock braking performance and tuning control
   parameters of ABS controllers. Another important merit of the proposed
   test bench is that it can comprehensively evaluate the fail-safe
   functions with regard to wheel speed signals since real tone rings and
   sensors are integrated in the bench. A 5-DOF vehicle model with
   consideration of longitudinal load transfer is used to calculate tire
   forces, wheel speeds and vehicle speed. Each of the four real-time wheel
   speed signal generators consists of a servo motor plus a ring gear,
   which has sufficient dynamic response ability to emulate the rapid
   changes of the wheel speeds under strict braking conditions of very
   slippery roads. The simulation of braking tests under different road
   adhesion coefficients using the HILS test bench is run, and results show
   that it can evaluate the anti-lock braking performance of ABS and partly
   the fail-safe functions. This HILS system can also be used in such
   applications as durability test, benchmarking and comparison between
   different ECUs. The test bench developed not only has a relatively low
   cost, but also can be used to validate the wheel speed-related ECU
   design and all its fail-safe functions, and a rapid testing and proving
   platform with a high efficiency for research and development of the
   automotive ABS is therefore provided.}},

Abstract = {{Secure processors have become increasingly important for trustworthy
   computing as security breaches escalate. By providing hardware-level
   protection, a secure processor ensures a safe computing environment
   where confidential data and applications can be protected against both
   hardware and software attacks. In this paper, we present a single-chip
   secure processor model and demonstrate rapid prototyping of the secure
   processor on the OpenSPARC FPGA platform. OpenSPARC T1 is an
   industry-grade, open-source, FPGA-synthesizable general-purpose
   microprocessor originally developed by Sun Microsystems, now acquired by
   Oracle. It is a multi-core, multi-threaded 64-bit processor with
   open-source hardware, including the microprocessor core, as well as
   system software that can be freely modified by researchers. We modify
   the OpenSPARC T1 processor by adding security modules: an AES engine, a
   TRNG and a memory integrity tree. These enhancements enable security
   features like memory encryption and memory integrity verification. By
   prototyping this single-chip secure processor on the FPGA platform, we
   find that the OpenSPARC T1 FPGA platform has many advantages for secure
   processor research. Our prototyping demonstrates that additional modules
   can be added quickly and easily and they add little resource overhead to
   the base OpenSPARC processor.}},

Abstract = {{Based on previous classical learning models created for animation and
   digital artists, this work presents a framework that stimulates
   creativity by divergent thinking without compromising technology and
   specialization.
   The classical learning model focuses on specialization by utilizing
   dedicated technologies and devices. Although this approach has proven to
   be successful in the past because it is highly skill oriented, it
   promotes directive teaching practice through mainly audio-visual
   content. Even though the technology is specialized, it is also limited
   and because of the empirical nature of the process the artists develop
   linear, sometimes even convergent thinking.
   Open hardware technologies provide first-hand fabrication experience in
   a workshop environment embracing interdisciplinary collaboration and
   information sharing. The aesthetic experience is perceived through
   vision, sound, smell and touch while the interactive experience is
   created by sensors, micro-controllers, kinetic sculptures, puppets and
   installations connected to virtual 3D worlds. This kind of learning
   environment in conjunction with the emotional interest enhances the
   capacity to achieve original content and ideas that have value, while
   the divergent thinking helps to find solutions in various areas and
   industries.}},

Abstract = {{The use of technology by children from lower levels of education is very
   dependent on the utility perception that teachers may encounter in their
   use. But even those teachers who want to innovate experience many
   obstacles. On one hand, the difficulties they have to use certain
   technologies and on the other hand the difficulties faced by schools to
   invest in acquiring the necessary equipment. Teachers need to be created
   facilitating conditions for technology upgrades, to help them reach a
   personal motivation level for its use. To resolve the second difficulty
   it must be created an awareness that there are already several
   alternatives, including the use of open hardware and electronic
   equipment at low cost, combined with the use of free software. The
   construction of tangible objects using open hardware and software to
   create a technology alliance will facilitate the diffusion of use and
   enable children to explore new forms of narrative, usually associated
   with higher levels of education.}},

   students majoring in electrical engineering and computer engineering.
   The Arduino is an open-source hardware platform that has recently gained
   a wide following among hobbyist and artist communities for its ease of
   use and the ability to build interactive projects with it quickly. A
   description of a microprocessors course that used these boards is
   provided. Results are presented demonstrating students' learning of
   microprocessors through their ability to develop projects of their own
   design. Survey results characterizing student enthusiasm for learning
   the material in this manner are also shown.}},

Abstract = {{There is growing student interest in renewable energy and electric
   vehicles. Energy storage is a critical technology for electric vehicles
   and to some extent for intermittent renewable energy sources. Battery
   life, performance, and cost remain a barrier to widespread use of
   battery energy storage. Increasing the number of students researching
   these technologies would increase the likelihood of progress.
   The process of testing batteries to characterize performance and
   durability typically requires the use of specialized equipment that may
   be beyond the budget for many educators. Hence, many interested students
   may not have access to the tools to perform these experiments.
   To remedy this, we have begun the development of an open source
   battery-testing platform that can be built at a fraction of the cost of
   commercial systems. Furthermore, the development of the testing platform
   provides educational opportunities for students.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a capstone project whose objective was to design,
   build and successfully test an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with
   real-time video surveillance capabilities. The student team was composed
   of seven students within an aeronautical concentration of their
   Mechanical Engineering Technology program. The students designed and
   built a UAV capable of flying under direct manual control and indirect
   automatic control. Direct manual control was accomplished via a model
   radio-control transmitter, while indirect control accomplished via the
   onboard autopilot system. Programmable autonomous flight software,
   utilizing global positioning satellites (GPS), controls the autopilot
   system. A ground control station (GCS) sends and receives telemetry from
   a 2.4GHz modem located in the UAV. The GCS utilized Paparazzi, an
   open-source hardware and software autopilot platform, which allows
   mission specific flight plans to be created, uploaded, and executed and
   monitored during the UAV's flight. Real-time video from the UAV is
   transmitted to the GCS via an antenna and receiver. This comprehensive
   design and build project, concluding with successful test flights,
   enhanced the student learning and performance during the course of the
   project. Assessment data gathered by the project faculty mentor are
   provided in the paper.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a practical approach to teaching power electronics
   converter experiment that integrates fuzzy logic control. The approach
   is based on a model-free software-hardware platform for use in converter
   experiments in a basic power electronics course. This course is an
   elective topic, and, therefore, the experiments need to motivate the
   students. The platform is controlled by fuzzy logic-based software (made
   in MATLAB and LABVIEW environment) and run on a personal computer (PC).
   The fuzzy logic control incorporates attractive features such as
   simplicity, good performance, and automation, while using a low-cost
   hardware and software implementation. The student can manage the
   fundamental parameters of the converter topology using the software
   environment. The software is designed to provide simple interaction
   between the student and hardware. The laboratory experiment is performed
   using a low cost micro-controller PIC16F877 in order to verify the
   design performance over a wide range of operating conditions. After the
   basic experiment is explained, students have reinforced their
   theoretical knowledge of power converters with fuzzy logic. All students
   have reacted positively to the experiments and overall interest has
   definitely been increased.}},

Abstract = {{Simulating in closed loop power systems controlled by Field Programmable
   Gate Array (FPGA) embedded processors using digital or mixed-signal
   simulation tools is a very time-consuming task and does not support
   tracing high-level programming language instructions. The aim of this
   paper is to show how Hardware in the Loop simulation can be a very
   effective approach to perform software verification in those systems.
   The embedded processor core, peripherals, and the power converter model
   are all implemented into the same FPGA. The digital control algorithm is
   written in C language and runs on the FPGA embedded processor. The power
   converter switching model is described in synthesizable VHDL using the
   VHDL-2008 floating point package, which shortens the design cycle. Using
   the low-cost hardware and software debugging tools supplied by the FPGA
   vendor, current and voltages of the power converter model are monitored,
   and C instructions can be traced while running on the embedded processor
   core. The power converter VHDL model is stopped when the embedded
   processor core is halted by the high-level C language debugger. Results
   show the feasibility of this approach.}},

Abstract = {{We present SensLAB, a very large scale wireless sensor network
   testbed(1). SensLAB is distributed among 4 sites having different
   topologies and consists of 1024 wireless nodes based on open source
   hardware \& software. Within a given site, each one of the 256 nodes is
   able to communicate via its radio interface (868Mhz or 2.4Ghz) to its
   neighbors. Furthermore, every sensor node is potentially configurable as
   a sink node and can exchange data with any other sink node of the whole
   SensLAB testbed and/or Internet application. The testbed is designed to
   achieve reproducibility of experimentation, while also supporting
   evaluation of protocols and applications in real world settings. It
   allows to monitor transparently, i.e., without any
   insertion/modification within the code, any deployed application in
   terms of energy consumption or radio activity. The main benefits of
   SensLAB for the users are to reduce the costs in terms of:
   infrastructure investment, maintenance cost and operating cost. With
   SensLAB you can be up and running minutes after you are assigned an
   account! SensLAB's main and most important goal is to offer an accurate
   open access multi-users scientific tool to support the design,
   development, tuning, and experimentation of real large-scale sensor
   network applications. During this demo, we propose to demonstrate the
   interests of the SensLAB testbed by developing and running two
   experimental scenarii that highlight the services offered by SensLAB.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a low-overhead hardware profiling architecture,
   called LEAP, that attains real-time cycle and energy profiles of an
   FPGA-based soft processor. A novel technique is used to associate
   profiling data with specific functions in a way that is area-and
   power-efficient. Results show that relative to a previously-published
   hardware profiler, our design uses up to 18x less area and 8.6x less
   energy. LEAP is designed to be extensible for a variety of profiling
   tasks, three of which are investigated in this paper. We also
   demonstrate the utility of LEAP in the context of hardware/software
   co-design of processor/accelerator FPGA-based systems.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the minimum mean-squared error with successive interference
   cancellation (MMSE-SIC) detection of a frame of data in the spatially
   multiplexed multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system. A complete
   MMSE-SIC detector needs to compute at both the preprocessing and
   SIC-detection stages. Since the SIC detection, which can be regarded as
   a backward substitution, is inevitable, we develop a computationally
   efficient preprocessing algorithm that relies on the backward
   substitution. We then propose a low-cost hardware architecture with a
   commonly shared backward-substitution module to work at both the
   preprocessing and detection stages. The very-large-scale-integration
   implementation results of our architecture for the four-by-four MIMO
   system using the 0.18-mu m complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor
   technology reveal that our architecture requires the fewest 79-K gates,
   provides the high throughput rate of 416 Mb/s, and works with the
   smallest preprocessing latency of 64 clock cycles. Our MMSE-SIC detector
   is a cheap solution for MIMO detection.}},

Abstract = {{Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and micro air vehicles (MAV) are already
   intensively used in geodetic applications. State of the art autonomous
   systems are however geared towards the application area in safe and

   altitudes still require a human pilot. A new application field will be
   the reconstruction of structures and buildings, including the facades
   and roofs, with semi-autonomous MAVs. Ongoing research in the MAV
   robotics field is focusing on enabling this system class to operate at
   lower altitudes in proximity to nearby obstacles and humans. PIXHAWK is
   an open source and open hardware toolkit for this purpose. The quadrotor
   design is optimized for onboard computer vision and can connect up to
   four cameras to its onboard computer. The validity of the system design
   is shown with a fully autonomous capture flight along a building.}},

Abstract = {{In the last years the functionality and type of UAV-systems increased

   to build an autonomous aerial surveying airplane, which can fulfil the
   necessities ( aerial photographs with very-high resolution) of other
   departments at the university and very useful and practical for teaching
   photogrammetry.
   The base was a commercial, remote controlled model airplane and an
   open-source GPS/IMU system (MatrixPilot) was adapted to achieve the
   semi-automatic or automatic stabilization and navigation of the model
   airplane along predefined trajectory. The firmware is completely
   open-source and easily available on the website of the project.
   The first used camera system was a low-budget, low-quality video camera,
   which could provide only 1.2 megapixel photographs or low resolution
   video depending on the light conditions and the desired spatial
   resolution.
   A field measurement test was carried out with the described system: the
   aerial surveying of an undiscovered archaeological site, signed by a
   crop-mark in mountain Pilis (Hungary).}},

Title = {{Shear wave velocity in surface sediments}},
Journal = {{JOKULL}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{61}},
Pages = {{51-64}},
Abstract = {{Surface sediments of different nature are common in Iceland. Natural
   soil sites and man-made fillings commonly serve as foundations for
   different oyes of structures. In Civil engineering work it is
   fundamental to know the geotechnical properties of these materials in
   the upper 20-30 m. A seismic method called Spectral Analysis of Surface
   Waves (SASW) has been used in recent decades in Iceland to measure and
   evaluate shear wave velocity at different natural sites as well as in
   man-made fillings. The method is last and involves low cost equipment.
   It gives reliable results down to 20 m depth by using sledge as a
   seismic source and copes with both soft and stiff soil sites.
   Furthermore, the technique can be applied at coarse grained gravelly
   sites where it can be difficult to use borehole and penetration methods.
   We describe the methodology used in these projects' and review all SASW
   measurements carried out in Iceland. The soil strata at all test sites
   are classified based on sieve analysis when possible. Natural sites and
   man-made fillings are kept separated. A database and an open web site
   are introduced where all the SASW results can be viewed and shear wave
   profiles for different soil types and unlike sites can be compared. The
   main aim with the database and the webpage is to give scientists and
   engineers access to this data and enable them to compare stiffness at
   different sites.}},

Abstract = {{In 1this paper we investigate produsage using Actor-Network Theory with

   argue that produsage is not a model that determines a change in the
   traditional consumption/production paradigm through a series of
   essential preconditions (such as open participation, peer-sharing, or
   common ownership). Rather, we explain produsage as the open-ended result
   of a series of heterogeneous actor-networking strategies. In this view,
   the so-called preconditions do not explain produsage but have to be
   explained along with its establishment as an actor-network. Drawing on
   this approach, we discuss a case study of an open hardware project: the
   Arduino board, and we develop a perspective that maps the skills of
   human and non-human entities in produsage actor-networks, showing how
   skills are symmetrical, relational, and circulating.}},

Abstract = {{The scanning long-wave optical test system (SLOTS) is under development
   at the University of Arizona to provide rapid and accurate measurements
   of aspherical optical surfaces during the grinding stage. It is based on
   the success of the software configurable optical test system (SCOTS)
   which uses visible light to measure surface slopes. Working at long wave
   infrared (LWIR, 7-14 um), SLOTS measures ground optical surface slopes
   by viewing the specular reflection of a scanning hot wire. A thermal
   imaging camera collects data while motorized stages scan the wire
   through the field. Current experiments show that the system can achieve
   a high precision at micro-radian level with fairly low cost equipment.
   The measured surface map is comparable with interferometer for slow
   optics. This IR system could be applied early in the grinding stage of
   fabrication of large telescope mirrors to minimize the surface shape
   error imparted during processing. This advantage combined with the
   simplicity of the optical system (no null optics, no high power carbon
   dioxide laser) would improve the efficiency and shorten the processing
   time.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a GPS/PDR (Pedestrian Dead Reckoning) algorithm for
   pedestrian navigation including in-flight step length parameter
   correction. GPS compensates the position error from PDR and estimates
   the step length parameter. Kalman filter is used as an estimating
   technique for integrating the stride length and GPS measurement. The
   heading is calculated using GPS heading and gyro output.
   According to pedestrian location based service takes the limelight as a
   new growth engine, need for the pedestrian navigation is increasing.
   Among the existing navigation system, GPS can be easily applied to the
   pedestrian navigation by using low cost equipment. But in urban
   environments, serious position error occurs when GPS signal is blocked
   by high building or tree. In order to solve this blockage problem, one
   of the solutions is integration of GPS and other navigation system. And
   GPS/INS is the famous integration algorithm. In car navigation and
   aircraft application, GPS/INS is well performed. But, in pedestrian
   navigation application, the classical GPS/INS approach used for vehicle
   navigation is not suitable{[}1]. The main problem to solve is the
   alignment of the IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit). An alternative is to
   use accelerometer signal pattern rather than its value to count the
   steps, this is PDR.
   The PDR is a kind of navigation system that provides pedestrian's
   position using own inertial sensors. The main algorithm of PDR is
   composed of step detection, step length estimation, heading estimation
   algorithms. PDR has a position shift error and slow propagation
   characteristics. The performance of PDR depends on the accuracy of step
   length estimation algorithms. But the step length varies with health
   condition, ground status and individual gait characteristics, etc.
   Therefore step length correction is needed for improving the position
   accuracy of PDR.
   In this paper, GPS/PDR algorithm for pedestrian navigation including
   in-flight step length parameter correction is presented. The step length
   is modeled as a linear combination of constants and step frequency and
   step length parameter is corrected by using GPS position. Kalman filter
   is used as an estimating technique for step length parameter correction.
   The corrected parameters are used to improve the position accuracy.
   Low-cost GPS receiver and MEMS IMU are used. The sensor module is
   mounted on the top of the head. The performance of the proposed
   algorithm is verified through the actual walking tests.}},

Abstract = {{Character animation has traditionally relied on complex and

   techniques. These methods are out of reach for low budget animation

   animation. In this paper we study how users can interpret simple actions
   like, walking, with different puppets. The system was deployed for the
   Xbox Kinect and shows how low-cost equipment's can provide a new mean
   for motion capture representation. Last, we performed a pilot experiment
   animating silhouettes and 3D puppets in real-time, based on body
   movements interpreted by non-expert artists, representing different
   Olympic Sports that vary on visual representation for other participants
   to identify. As a result, interaction with 2D puppets needs more

Abstract = {{Companies producing consumer products have begun working on ways to
   control their products over the IP (internet protocol). Multinational
   electronics firms are marking a fair share of their lines using
   technologies like the RF ID, a front end to the IP networks. The main
   feature that is achieved by the already-existing home automation systems
   is that, every piece of equipment integrated is to be controlled by a
   central unit. The proposed solutions based on this idea are relatively
   expensive and difficult to configure per each system environment. IP
   based systems are supposed to be simpler to be accessed and easier to
   manipulate, with the only necessity being, close proximity to a direct
   internet connection. With this in mind, we designed a low cost
   hardware/software framework based on a unit what we call the IPAcBox
   which allows home/industrial automation systems to be accessed and
   controlled through a direct internet connection right out of the box
   even in dynamic IP configurations. We have developed the software and
   hardware infrastructure necessary for this system. This research
   consists of designing the server and the client side software, the
   communication protocols and addressing some hardware issues, along with
   a proposal to further our studies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an efficient error concealment algorithm for video
   bitstream over error-prone channel suffering from damage. Moreover,
   hardware architecture design and chip implementation of the proposed
   error concealment algorithm are also presented. For spatial error
   concealment, a mode selection algorithm considering the reuse of intra
   mode information embedded in bitstream is developed for the adaptation
   of bilinear and directional interpolation. It suffers only 0.08 dB video
   quality drop in average but the speedup measured on a general purpose
   processor is up to 40 times compared with the conventional methods. It
   is also more suitable for low cost hardware design. For temporal error
   concealment, the decoded motion vectors of the neighboring blocks of the
   corrupted macroblock are reused to provide hints to estimate the motion
   vector of the corrupted macroblock. Moreover, for real-time
   applications, a data and computational results reuse scheme of motion
   vector estimation is proposed and 96\% computation and memory bandwidth
   can be reduced compared with the conventional methods with 0.18 dB
   quality drop in average. With the UMC 90 nm 1P9M process, the proposed

Abstract = {{Requirements for modern and future control systems for large projects
   like International Linear Collider demand high availability for control
   system components. Recently telecom industry came up with a great open
   hardware specification - Advanced Telecom Computing Architecture (ATCA).
   This specification is aimed for better reliability, availability and
   serviceability. Since its first market appearance in 2004. ATCA platform
   has shown tremendous growth and proved to be stable and well represented
   by a number of vendors. ATCA is an industry standard for highly
   available systems. On the other hand Service Availability Forum, a
   consortium of leading communications and computing companies, describes
   interaction between hardware and software. SAF defines a set of
   specifications such as Hardware Platform Interface, Application
   Interface Specification. SAF specifications provide extensive
   description of highly available systems, services and their interfaces.
   Originally aimed for telecom applications, these specifications can be
   used for accelerator controls software as well. This study describes
   benefits of using these specifications and their possible adoption to
   accelerator control systems. It is demonstrated how EPICS Redundant IOC
   was extended using Hardware Platform Interface specification, which made
   it possible to utilize benefits of the ATCA platform. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this work, current information about the contamination of ground- and
   surface-water resources by arsenic from geogenic sources in Latin
   America is presented together with possible emerging mitigation
   solutions. The problem is of the same order of magnitude as other world
   regions, such as SE Asia, but it is often not described in English.
   Despite the studies undertaken by numerous local researchers, and the
   identification of proven treatment methods for the specific water
   conditions encountered, no technologies have been commercialized due to
   a current lack of funding and technical assistance. Emerging, low-cost
   technologies to mitigate the problem of arsenic in drinking water
   resources that are suitable for rural and urban areas lacking
   centralized water supplies have been evaluated. The technologies
   generally use simple and low-cost equipment that can easily be handled
   and maintained by the local population. Experiences comprise (i)
   coagulation/filtration with iron and aluminum salts, scaled-down for
   small community-and household-scale-applications, (ii) adsorption
   techniques using low-cost arsenic sorbents, such as geological materials
   (clays, laterites, soils, limestones), natural organic-based sorbents
   (natural biomass), and synthetic materials. TiO2-heterogeneous
   photocatalysis and zerovalent iron, especially using nanoscale
   particles, appear to be promising emergent technologies. Another
   promising innovative method for rural communities is the use of
   constructed wetlands using native perennial plants for arsenic
   rhizofiltration. Smallscale simple reverse osmosis equipment (which can
   be powered by wind or solar energy) that is suitable for small
   communities can also be utilized.
   The individual benefits of the different methods have been evaluated in
   terms of (i) size of the treatment device, (ii) arsenic concentration
   and distribution of species, chemical composition and grade of
   mineralization in the raw water, (iii) guidelines for the remaining As
   concentration, (iv) economical constrains, (v) complexity of
   installation and maintenance, and infrastructure constraints (e.g.
   electricity needs). (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Many methods are used for determining the Anaerobic
   Threshold (AT) by means of sophisticated ergospirometer.
   Objective: To test the AT variation, detected by mathematical models and
   visual inspection, when low cost ergospirometer is used and intended for
   clinical application.
   Methods: Seventy nine apparently healthy subjects were volunteers in
   this study; from these, 57 men. The VO2max and the ventilatory threshold
   were determined by indirect, open-circuit calorimetry. The
   electro-enzymatic method was used for analyzing the lactacidemia and
   direct determination of the Lactate Threshold (LT). The AT was
   determined by two mathematical methods (MMRSS and MMslope), based on the
   gases exchange, and by the log-log visual method, for determining the
   LT. Two independent investigators determined the AT through visual
   inspection of three graphs, considering two methods (AT(-a) = V-slope,
   EqV; and AT(-b) = V-slope, EqV and ExCO(2)). The data were analyzed by
   means of parametric statistics for determining the differences between
   AT(-a) versus ExCO(2), MMRSS and MMslope; AT(-b) versus MMRSS and
   MMslope; and LT versus AT(-a), AT(-b), MMRSS and MMslope.
   Results: The MMslope was the only method that presented a significant
   difference between the AT(-a) and AT(-b) (p = 0.001), with CV\% > 15. LT
   versus M-Mslope did not present significant difference (p = 0.274),
   however, it was observed a high CV (24\%).
   Conclusion: It was concluded that with the low cost equipment, the MMRSS
   and AT(-a) methods can be used for determining the TAn. The MMslope
   method did not present satisfactory precision to be employed with this
   equipment. (Arq Bras Cardiol 2010; 95(3) : 354-363)}},

Abstract = {{The availability of sophisticated and low-cost hardware on a single
   chip, for example, CMOS cameras, CPU, DSP, processors and communication
   transceivers, optics, microfluidics, and micromechanics, has fostered
   the development of system-on-chip (SoC) technology, such as lab-on-chip
   or wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs). WMSNs are networks of
   wirelessly interconnected devices on a chip that are able to
   ubiquitously retrieve multimedia content such as video from the
   environment and transfer it to a central location for additional
   processing. In this paper, we study WMSNs that include an optical
   wireless communication transceiver that uses light to transmit the
   information. One of the primary challenges in SoC design is to attain
   adequate resources like energy harvesting using solar cells in addition
   to imaging and communication capabilities, all within stringent spatial
   limitations while maximizing system performances. There is an inevitable
   trade-off between enhancing the imaging resolution and the expense of
   reducing communication capacity and energy harvesting capabilities, on
   one hand, and increasing the communication or the solar cell size to the
   detriment of the imaging resolution, on the other hand. We study these
   trade-offs, derive a mathematical model to maximize the resolution of
   the imaging system, and present a numerical example that demonstrates
   maximum imaging resolution. Our results indicate that an eighth-order
   polynomial with only two constants provides the required area allocation
   between the different functionalities. (C) 2010 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new control algorithm for brushless dc (BLDC) motor
   drives is presented. Direct self-control, which has been widely applied
   on induction motor drives in high-power low-frequency traction, is
   introduced to BLDC drives. The Cartesian coordinate system is selected
   with three coordinate axes X, Y, and Z mutually at right angle to each
   other with three phase axes a, b, and c being movable. A two-phase
   conduction scheme is selected with the axis of the exciting phase
   located in the X-Y plane or, otherwise, along the direction of the
   Z-axis during unexcited (i.e., the unexcited phase axis is always
   directed along the Z-axis). The tracks of stator flux and voltage
   vectors are all three-dimensional, as a result of a variable voltage of
   unexcited phase and commutation every 60 electrical degrees. However,
   projections on the X-Y plane of these three-dimensional tracks are
   concise. The projection of flux vector is a hexagonal path, whereas the
   voltage vector projections are six active vectors. The projection of
   stator flux is controlled by the projections of voltage vectors. The
   newly proposed algorithm can be implemented with relatively low cost
   hardware and concise software, presenting fast torque transient response
   in 0.1 ms. The sensorless control is also implemented by flux estimation
   once in one sector. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed
   scheme are verified with simulated and experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the design and testing of an embedded system for a
   low-cost small scaled helicopter (Benzin Acrobatic from Vario (TM) with
   a 1.8 m diameter rotor). The sensors under consideration are an Inertial
   Measurement Unit (IMU), a GPS, a magnetometer, a barometer and on-off
   switches serving as take-off and landing detector. Along with one PC
   board and one micro-controller, they represent a total cost below USD
   3000. By contrast to other experiments reported in the literature, the
   presented work do not rely on any accurate IMU or GPS systems which
   costs are, separately, largely above the mentioned amount of USD 3000.
   To compensate the weaknesses of this low cost equipment, efforts focus
   on designing a robust, dependable and sufficiently embedded system,
   which exploits an accurate flight dynamics model. This improves the
   prediction capabilities of an embedded extended Kalman filter that
   serves for data fusion. The main contribution of this paper is to
   detail, at the light of a successful reported autonomous hovering
   flight, the hardware, software architectures and the derivation of the
   model along with its calibration. Numerous implementation details are
   presented and the relevance of some modeling hypothesis is discussed.

Abstract = {{A fuzzy if-then rule-based intra-field deinterlacing method using
   geometric duality is presented in this paper. The proposed method is a
   content-based hybrid scheme switching between the well-known edge-based
   linear average method and the proposed geometric duality-based
   deinterlacing method. Conventional deinterlacing methods usually employ
   edge-based interpolation techniques within pixel-based estimations.
   However, they are somewhat sensitive to noise and intensity variations
   in the image. Moreover, their performance is visually unacceptable due
   to their failure to estimate edge direction. To reduce this sensitivity,
   the proposed algorithm investigates features from low-resolution images,
   and applies them to high-resolution images to calculate the missing
   pixels. We analyzed properties of the missing pixels and modeled them
   using geometric regularity. Depending on the features of the region, the
   missing pixels were interpolated in different ways. The proposed
   algorithm is computationally feasible and promises to be a good
   candidate for a low-cost hardware interpolator.}},

Abstract = {{In the urban environment there is a need for new and renovated building
   fac, ades to be created in harmony with the existing environment. This
   paper describes a simple approach to the acquisition of geo-data. An
   off-the-shelf software package together with low-cost equipment was used
   to collect building inventory data from a combination of high-resolution
   digital and video camera images, digital close-range photogrammetry
   techniques and geographic information systems. The method consists of
   three stages. First the potential of geo-data acquisition is
   investigated by using a video camera and a digital camera. The second
   stage outlines the metric survey for the management of building fac, ade
   inventory data for geographical information systems in making correct
   decisions in urban areas. The third stage explains how video camera
   images can be used to obtain attribute data related to different uses.
   The methodology developed was tested in a street in Ankara, the capital
   city of Turkey. It is concluded that this low-cost method using
   off-the-shelf software offers many advantages and benefits in different

Abstract = {{Small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are becoming popular among
   researchers and vital platforms for several autonomous mission systems.
   In this paper, we present the design and development of a miniature
   autonomous rotorcraft weighing less than 700 g and capable of waypoint
   navigation, trajectory tracking, visual navigation, precise hovering,
   and automatic takeoff and landing. In an effort to make advanced
   autonomous behaviors available to mini- and microrotorcraft, an embedded
   and inexpensive autopilot was developed. To compensate for the
   weaknesses of the low-cost equipment, we put our efforts into designing
   a reliable model-based nonlinear controller that uses an inner-loop
   outer-loop control scheme. The developed flight controller considers the
   system's nonlinearities, guarantees the stability of the closed-loop
   system, and results in a practical controller that is easy to implement
   and to tune. In addition to controller design and stability analysis,
   the paper provides information about the overall control architecture
   and the UAV system integration, including guidance laws, navigation
   algorithms, control system implementation, and autopilot hardware. The
   guidance, navigation, and control (GN\&C) algorithms were implemented on
   a miniature quadrotor UAV that has undergone an extensive program of
   flight tests, resulting in various flight behaviors under autonomous
   control from takeoff to landing. Experimental results that demonstrate
   the operation of the GN\&C algorithms and the capabilities of our
   autonomous micro air vehicle are presented. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{The method described in this work, termed GELPOR3D, is characterised by
   its simplicity of use, low-cost equipment, compositional flexibility,
   and lack of aggressive or toxic solvents or other thermal treatment.
   This technique ensures the generation of a three-dimensional network of
   interconnected pores (300-900 mu m); in addition, a random and not
   necessarily connected porosity is generated, yielding a hierarchical
   porous architecture from the macro to the molecular scale. The
   interconnected pores, large enough to ensure an adequate vascularization
   and new tissue ingrowth, can be obtained by pouring a slurry containing
   a biodegradable thermogel (such as agarose and gellan) and a ceramic
   into a mold consisting of a three-dimensional network of rigid
   filaments. Additional pore distributions in the macropore region can be
   tailored as a function of the drying/preservation technology (10-100 mu
   m) or the interaction between the inorganic particles coated by the
   polymeric components (0.1-1 mu m). Moreover, porosity in the mesopore
   range can be created by shaping ceramics such as mesoporous silica or
   nanocrystalline carbonatehydroxyapatite. In addition to the various
   bioceramics that have been successfully shaped, this method is flexible
   enough to allow the introduction of certain substances whose controlled
   release may help to avoid some negative effects that usually appear with
   the implantation of a material, i.e. infection, inflammation, etc., or
   to simplify some of the many steps required for the successful
   integration of a graft. (C) 2009 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Abstract = {{This paper presents a low-complexity and low-cost hardware
   implementation of a Volterra series-based digital pre-distorter (DPD).
   This is achieved by introducing two novel model complexity reduction
   techniques into the system, namely, look-up table assisted gain indexing
   and time-division multiplexing for multiplier sharing. Experimental
   results show that this novel DPD implementation uses much less hardware
   resources, but still maintains excellent performance compared to
   conventional approaches.}},

Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{Moving object segmentation plays an important role in a complex object
   tracking system. This system decides whether the current block belongs
   to the object region or not. In this article, a scheme using background
   modeling based on runtime-weighted features for robustly adaptive moving
   object segmentation in infrared (IR) image sequence is proposed.
   Proposed background modeling for an open hardware (H/W) architecture
   design decreases the size of the search area to construct a sparse block
   template of search area in infrared images. The authors also compensate
   for motion compensation when the image moves in previous and current
   frames of IR imaging system. The method of separation of background and
   objects applies to adaptive values through time analysis of pixel
   intensity The proposed method uses more feature information such as
   intensity, deviation, block matching error, and velocity. The weighting
   values give a higher weight to feature information which has a large
   difference between the object and the background region. Based on
   experimental results, the proposed method showed real-time moving object
   segmentation through background modeling in the proposed embedded
   system. (C) 2010 Society for Imaging Science and Technology. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{Using robots for teaching is one approach that has gathered good results
   on Middle-School, High-School and Universities. Robotics gives chance to
   experiment concepts of a broad range of disciplines, principally those
   from Engineering courses and Computer Science. However, there are not
   many kits that enables the use of robotics in classroom. This article
   describes the methodologies to implement tools which serves as testbeds
   for the use of robotics to teach Computer Science and Engineering.
   Therefore, it proposes the development of a flexible, low cost hardware
   to integrate sensors and control actuators commonly found on mobile
   robots; the development of a mobile robot device whose sensors and
   actuators allows the experimentation of different concepts; and an
   environment for the implementation of control algorithms through a
   computer network. This paper describes each one of these tools and
   discusses the implementation issues and future works.}},

Abstract = {{As the history of television industry goes, multiview video (MVV) and
   its applications draw more and more attentions by the realistic 3D scene
   it can bring. In these applications, virtual view synthesis is required
   for providing free view point sequences so as to fulfill a real-time
   display system. In this paper, a low-area architecture is proposed. By
   employing the linear-interpolated approximation algorithm, the large
   area requirement due to the synthesis parameters is resolved. In
   addition, redundant information for fraction bits of parameters is
   further reduced by precision fitting analysis. As a result, 95.9\% of
   area for matrix parameter rendering stage and 69.5\% for vector
   transform stage are reduced with only 0.0059 dB overhead of PSNR
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Recent reviews show large failure rates in the commercialization of new
   product designs Often, the reason of failure has been not a lack of
   technological capability of the firm, but a wrong understanding of

   our concept of ``embedded toolkits for user co-design{''} proposes to
   design products with build-in flexibility by embedding knowledge and
   rules about possible product differentiations into the product This
   approach can be seen as a scalable attempt towards ``open hardware{''},
   extending the open innovation paradigm beyond software towards tangible
   products Users are enabled to modify a product directly according to
   their individual needs. We present a technology acceptance study (TAM)
   of such an embedded toolkit in an automobile. Surveying 163 users
   demonstrates the general feasibility and value drivers of embedded
   toolkits Our paper contributes to the literature by discussing the

Abstract = {{Although polypropylene is one of the most used polymers at industrial
   level due to good balanced properties, it presents some restrictions in
   applications that require good adhesion properties as well as coating
   and painting. These restrictions are related to its non polar nature
   which leads to low wetting properties. So that, in most cases, it is
   necessary a previous surface pre-treatment in order to improve adhesion
   properties. These surface treatments could be physical or chemical.
   Among the wide variety of physical processes, plasma technologies are
   useful from both technical and environmental points of view. If we take
   into account economic considerations, chemical processes are interesting
   due to low cost equipment and procedures. In particular, we have used
   photografting of methyl methacrylate (MMA) monomer on polypropylene
   substrates with UV radiation and initiators. This process is useful to
   promote chemical modification of polypropylene surface by grafting MMA
   monomers into polypropylene polymer chains. Due to polarity of some
   groups in MMA monomers, it is possible to increase surface wettability
   thus promoting a remarkable increase in adhesion properties of
   polypropylene. In this work, changes in wettability of polypropylene
   surfaces in terms of the exposure time to UV radiation in presence of
   MMA monomers and initiators has been investigated. Furthermore, chemical
   changes have been characterized by FTIR analysis and mechanical
   performance of adhesion joints has been evaluated by T-peel tests.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an efficient architecture for Inter-layer prediction of
   H.264/SVC is proposed. The proposed architecture is based on a two-layer
   model with QCIF and CIF size for base layer and enhancement layer,
   respectively. In the proposed architecture, the motion vector prediction
   mode is not concerned due to its limited coding efficiency. Only the
   Intra prediction mode and residual prediction mode in inter-layer
   prediction are supported. Furthermore, on the basis of our simulation
   results, the residual prediction mode is rarely selected. Using an
   efficient mode selection algorithm which is proposed by our previous
   work, the complexity of residual prediction is significantly reduced.
   Therefore, to realize real-time processing with low cost hardware, the
   proposed architecture makes use of a single-core coding engine. The
   basic coding core is the same as the traditional H.264/AVC with a novel
   supplemental up-sampling core. Using this coding core, the macroblock
   encoding is performed for base layer and enhancement layer
   alternatively. The proposed up-sampling module is described by
   Verilog-HDL and synthesis results show that the gate counts are 16,121
   and the maximum working frequency is 141MHz.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a real-time simulation
   environment for the validation of controller for an autonomous
   small-scale helicopter.
   Design/methodology/approach - The real-time simulation platform is
   developed based on the nonlinear model of a series of small-scale
   helicopters. Dynamics of small-scale helicopter is analyzed through
   simulation. The controller is designed based on the extracted linear
   model.
   Findings - The model-based linear controller can be effectively designed
   and tested using real-time simulation platform. The hover controller is
   demonstrated to be robust against wind disturbance.
   Research limitations/implications - To use the real-time simulation
   environment to test and validate controllers for small-scale
   helicopters, basic helicopter parameters need to be measured, calculated
   or estimated.
   Practical implications - The real-time simulation environment can be
   used generically to test and validate controllers for small-scale
   helicopters.

Abstract = {{A novel end-point fluorimetric procedure based on the use of
   rhodamine-110-labeled specific substrate was developed to determine
   trypsin activities in biological samples. We evaluated the ability of
   trichloroacetic acid and acetic acid to stop the enzymatic reaction
   without hindering the detection of the fluorescence of rhodamine-110
   released into the reaction mixture from the specific substrate
   (CBZ-L-alanyl-L-arginine)(2)-rhodamine-110. Trichloroacetic acid
   decreased markedly the fluorescence of rhodamine-110, even at low
   concentrations. On the other hand, the addition of 50 mmol/l acetic acid
   inactivated efficiently trypsin activity, causing minor effects on
   rhodamine-110 fluorescence. The proposed procedure was more sensitive
   than the spectrophotometric end-point method using
   N-alpha-benzoyl-DL-arginine-p-nitroanilide as substrate. The possibility
   of carrying out end-point fluorimetric assays improves the performance
   of monocell fluorimeters by setting specific conditions optimal for each
   enzyme activity independently of the fluorimeter. This method also
   allows replicate assays to be conducted simultaneously, resulting in
   considerable time saving and in increased performance of low-cost
   equipment.}},

Abstract = {{Hierarchical Error Diffusion (HED) developed in {[}14] yields
   high-quality color halftone by explicitly designing three critical
   factors: dot overlapping, positioning, and coloring. However, HED
   requires more error memory buffer than the conventional error diffusion
   algorithms since the pixel error is diffused in dot-color domain,
   instead of colorant domain. This can potentially be an issue for certain
   low-cost hardware implementation. This paper develops a memory-efficient
   HED algorithm (MEHED). To achieve this goal, the pixel error in
   dot-color domain is converted backward and diffused to future pixels in
   input colorant domain, say, CMYK for print applications. Since the
   error-augmented pixel value is no longer bounded within the range {[}0,
   1.0], the dot overlapping control algorithm developed in {[}14] needs to
   be generalized to coherently handle the pixel density of outside the
   normal range. The key is to carefully split the modified pixel density
   into three parts: negative, regular, and surplus densities. The
   determination of regular and surplus densities needs to be dependent on
   the density of K channel, in order to maintain local color and avoid
   halftone texture artifact. The resulting dot-color densities are serves
   as the input to hierarchical thresholding and coloring steps to generate
   final halftone output. Experimental results demonstrate that MEHED
   achieves similar image quality compared to HED.}},

Abstract = {{In the music field, an open issue is represented by the creation of
   innovative tools for acquisition, preservation and sharing of
   information. The strong difficulties in preserving the original
   carriers, together dedicated equipments able to read any (often
   obsolete) format, encouraged the analog/digital (A/D) transfer of audio
   contents in order to make them available in digital libraries.
   Unfortunately, the A/D transfer is often an invasive process.
   This work proposes an innovative and not-invasive approach to audio
   extraction from complex source material, such as shellac phonographic
   discs: PoG (Photos Of Ghosts) is a new system, able to reconstruct the
   audio signal from a still image of a disc surface. It is automatic,
   needs of low-cost hardware, recognizes different rpm and performs an
   automatic separation of the tracks; also it is robust with respect to

Abstract = {{Secure login methods based on human cognitive skills can be classified
   into two categories based on information available to a passive
   attacker: (i) the attacker fully observes the entire input and output of
   a login procedure, (ii) the attacker only partially observes the input
   and output. Login methods secure in the fully observable model imply
   very long secrets and/or complex calculations. In this paper, we study
   three simple PIN-entry methods designed for the partially observable
   attacker model. A notable feature of the first method is that the user
   needs to perform a very simple mathematical operation, whereas, in the
   other two methods, the user performs a simple table lookup. Our
   usability study shows that all the methods have reasonably low login
   times and minimal error rates. These results, coupled with low-cost
   hardware requirements (only earphones), are a significant improvement
   over existing approaches for this model {[}9,10]. We also show that
   side-channel timing attacks present a real threat to the security of
   login schemes based on human cognitive skills.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the relatively high node density and source-to-sink communication
   pattern, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are subject to congestion and
   packet losses. Further, the availability of low-cost hardware, such as
   Cyclops cameras, is promoting wireless multimedia sensing to support,
   for example, visual surveillance. As a result, congestion control is
   becoming more critical in WSNs. In this paper, we present a lightweight
   distributed congestion control method in WSNs. We develop new metrics to
   detect congestion in each node by considering the queue lengths and
   channel conditions observed in the one-hop neighborhood. Based on the
   estimated level of congestion, each node dynamically adapts its packet
   transmission rate and balance the load among the one-hop neighbors to
   avoid creating congestion and bottleneck nodes. In a simulation study
   performed in OMNeT++, our approach significantly enhances the end-to-end
   (e2e) packet delivery ratio and reduces the e2e delay without increasing
   the total energy consumption compared to the tested baseline approach.}},

Abstract = {{Low cost and attractive equipment for use in experimental higher physics
   education has been desired by teachers, especially those in developing
   world. A system of novel experimental apparatus named Personal Desk Lab
   (PDL) was developed {[}1]. Each apparatus is miniaturized to one-fifth
   of the conventional one or less, and built on a steel plate; therefore,
   it is portable and can be used on a classroom desk. Each set is
   constructed by some parts divided according to their functions, and some
   of the parts are used in a number of experiments; which saves material,
   cost, and storage space. All parts are designed to be easy to make,
   maintain and repair. Almost all apparatus are battery driven {[}2].
   After ICPE 2006, we have improved the system continuously; consequently,
   the experimental themes cover the field of mechanics, electromagnetism
   and optics. The number of these themes in use exceeds ten. The
   performance of PDL has been tested at Chiba University, Japan and Royal
   University of Phnom Penh (RUPP), Cambodia. In Chiba University, physics
   education with PDL is currently conducted individually to 80(max.)
   students in a classroom at the same time, and to more than 900 students
   per year. Experiment class using PDL in Cambodia started on October 2008
   with 120 students of physics department, RUPP. They were divided into
   three classes, and conducted four experimental themes in pairs. The
   advantages confirmed from the practices at two universities are as
   follows: (1) the use of PDL arouses learner's interest, promotes their
   deep understanding extensively, and inspires to learn further; and (2)
   costs for introduction and running of PDL system are fairly small
   compared to the traditional one. Furthermore, the instruction for
   distant learners having PDL on each hand was conducted successfully
   through internet.}},

Abstract = {{At various stages of a product life, faults arise from different
   sources. During product bring up, logic errors are dominant. During
   production, manufacturing defects are main concerns while during
   operation, the concern shifts to aging defects. No matter what the
   source is, debugging such defects may permit logic, circuit or physical
   design changes to eliminate them in future. Within a processor chip,
   there are three broad categories of structures, namely the large memory
   structures such as caches, small memory structures such as reorder
   buffer, issue queue, and load-store buffers and the data-path. Most
   control functions and data steering operations are based on small memory
   structures and they are hard to debug. In this paper, we propose a
   lightweight hardware scheme, called shadow checker to detect faults in
   these critical units. The entries in these units are tested by means of
   a shadow entry that mimics intended operation. A mismatch traps an
   error. The shadow checker shadows an entry for a few thousand cycles
   before moving on to shadow another. This scheme can be employed to test
   chips during silicon debug, manufacturing test as well as during regular
   operation. We ran experiments on 13 SPEC2000 benchmarks and found that
   our scheme detects 100\% of inserted faults.}},

Abstract = {{Phase change memory (PM) is an emerging memory technology for future
   computing systems. Compared to other non-volatile memory alternatives,
   PCM is more `natured to production, and has a faster read latency and
   potentially higher storage density The main roadblock precluding PCM
   from being used, in particular, in the main memory hierarchy is its
   limited write endurance. To address this issue, recent studies proposed
   to either reduce PCM's write frequency or use wear-leveling to evenly
   distribute writes. Although these techniques can extend the lifetime of
   PCM, most of them will not prevent deliberately designed malicious codes
   from wearing it out quickly Furthermore, all the prior techniques did
   not consider the circumstances of a compromised OS and its security
   implication to the overall PCM design. A compromised OS will allow
   adversaries to manipulate processes and exploit side channels to
   accelerate wear-out.
   In this paper, we argue that a PCM design not only has to consider
   normal wear-out under normal application behavior, most importantly it
   must take the worst-case scenario into account with the presence of
   malicious exploits and a compromised OS to address the durability and
   security issues simultaneously In this paper, we propose a novel,
   low-cost hardware mechanism called Security Refresh to avoid information
   leak by constantly migrating their physical locations inside the PCM,
   obfuscating the actual data placement from users and system software. It
   uses a dynamic randomized address mapping scheme that swaps data using
   random keys upon each refresh due. The hardware overhead is tiny without
   using any table. The best lifetime we can achieve under the worst-case
   malicious attack is more than six years. Also, our scheme incurs around
   1\% performance degradation for normal program operations.}},

Abstract = {{In the last fifteen years, the technological education has been
   essentially based on digital technology, leaving aside the use of
   concrete material. Still having excellent simulators of the physical
   world, working with concrete material allows the development of
   cognitive structures that digital doesn't offer. Moreover, these
   didactic resources allow highly participative group dynamics that have
   not been yet reached by the existing computers at schools.
   Unfortunately, in our view there are two major difficulties for the
   presence of these resources in the classroom. The physical technology is
   expensive and suffers from constant wear. On the other hand, teachers
   arc not accustomed to working in a dynamic classroom with a methodology
   of work in a participative group, and have fears about the use of
   specific technological equipment. Physical Etoys is a development that
   aims to overcome these difficulties.
   Physical Etoys facilitates the interaction between inexperienced users
   and concrete material such as open hardware devices or popular toys by
   providing a powerful and intuitive visual programming system in order to
   explore and learn science in an enjoyable way. The objective of this
   paper is to introduce a new module of Physical Etoys which aims to
   persuade kids to do different electronic projects with an Arduino Board.}},

Abstract = {{For the design of a hybrid GNSS/INS or other multi-sensors navigation
   system, a very challenging topic is the timing issue. Unknown time
   synchronization errors among IMU, GNSS receiver and other sensors lead
   to significant data source errors and degrade alignment or navigation
   performance. Traditional methods to resolve this problem is based on
   hardware, software or the combination of both, each of which is unable
   to achieve the simultaneous optimization of cost and performance. In
   this paper, a flexible, low-cost time synchronization system (FLTS) is
   proposed to eliminate time synchronization errors and supply satisfied
   precision with much lower complexity and cost. Some key issues on Field
   Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) hardware design and programming of FLTS
   are detailed discussed. To achieve millisecond synchronization
   precision, the 1PPS (Pulse Per Second) signal from GPS receiver is used
   as time reference to add timestamps for the output data of INS and other
   auxiliary navigation sensors. With low cost hardware and flexible
   configuration, our FLTS wins features of grand usage and expansibility,
   and can meet the time synchronization needs not only of GNSS/INS
   integration, but also other multi-sensors navigation systems.}},

Abstract = {{Military organizations and commercial companies greatly depend on
   satellite communications and non-terrestrial data transfers for
   day-to-day business and warfare requirements. To reduce launch and
   production costs, militaries have adopted the use of commercial
   (corporate-owned) satellites, sharing available bandwidth and
   capabilities. Many of these commercial and military SATCOM assets are
   not protected from network and radio frequency (RF) attacks by
   adversaries using open-source and publically-available resources;
   operating from within developed or developing countries. Recent events
   have demonstrated that sophisticated military communication (MILCOM)
   satellites can be effortlessly compromised using low-cost equipment and
   radios available from commercial sources. Both digital and analogue
   signals can be captured, manipulated, and/or transmitted with little or
   no risk to the offending red forces, and low-cost global positioning
   system (GPS) jamming devices can be used to frustrate blue forces.
   Open-source programs for SATCOM transponders are available for download
   via hobbyist, equipment vendors, and black hat web sites with
   documentation and other resources for research and manipulation by red
   forces. Furthermore, red forces can utilize blue force SATCOM and MILSAT
   assets as a dependable and secure means for covert back-channel data and
   voice communications, increasing their ability to relay information
   while decreasing their detectable digital footprint. This paper
   identifies and demonstrates current open-source and publically-available
   capabilities for red teams assessing blue force SATCOM assets, to
   include: Identifying potential SATCOM and MILSAT targets Unauthorized
   use of satellite capabilities (covert communications) Uplink/downlink
   jamming and denial of service attacks Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks
   and Commandeering of SATCOM signals Eavesdropping Malware development
   and delivery using resources available on black hat and Hamm radio
   hobbyist web sites This paper concludes by identifying vulnerabilities
   associated with currently deployed commercial and military satellite
   systems based solely on open-source and publically-available resources.
   The authors will conclude by presenting possible solutions for future
   SATCOM and MILSAT security.}},

Abstract = {{The use of open-source software in many institutions and organizations
   is increasing. However, a balance should be considered between the
   software cost and the cost of its technical support and reliability. In
   this article, a maintenance system for wind farms will be presented. It
   is connected to an information system for maintenance, called SNIFF
   (Terology Integrated Modular System) as a general base to manage the
   assets and as a support strategic line to the evolution of this system,
   which incorporates on-condition maintenance modules, and the support to
   the research and development done around this theme. The SMIT system is
   based on a TCP/IP network, using a Linux server running a PostgreSQL
   database and Apache web server with PHP, and Octave and R software for
   numerical analysis. Maintenance technicians, chiefs, economic and
   production management personnel can access SMIT database through SMIT
   clients for Windows. In addition, this maintenance system for wind
   systems uses also special low cost hardware for data acquisition on
   floor level. The hardware uses a distributed TCP/IP network to
   synchronize SMIT server master clock through Precision Time Protocol.
   Usually, the manufactures construct, deploy and give the means for the
   suppliers to perform the wind system's maintenance. This is a very
   competitive area, where companies tend to hide the development details
   and implementations. Within this scenario, the development of
   maintenance management models for multiple wind equipments is important,
   and will allow countries to be more competitive in a growing market. For
   on-condition monitoring, the algorithms are based on Support Vector
   Machines and time series analysis running under Octave and R open-source
   software's.}},

   downtime caused by faults. These are the key points presented in this
   paper, which also emphasizes the very recent contribution of 3D models
   in aiding fault diagnosis and terology in general. The way to achieve
   the above-mentioned objectives is through on-condition maintenance in
   two main fields, wind farms and Diesel engines. In wind farms,
   maintenance is done through the control of variables, such as vibration
   signals and the balance of electrical currents. As for Diesel engines,
   on-condition variables are the emissions of PM10, NOx, CO, HC and CO2.
   However, there are problems in both situations, namely, in the first
   case, the distance and accessibility of the generators and, in the
   second case, the problems associated with the fact that the equipment is
   not static. Another common problem in both situations is the measuring
   and transmission of the values of the on-condition variables, because,
   in the case of wind farms, the machine is placed on top of the tower
   and, in the case of Diesel engines, the vehicles are in operation most
   of the time and most of the measurements need be made while the vehicles
   are running. Also, although the two situations seem different, they have
   many issues in common, such as those above-mentioned, for which we will
   propose convergent solutions that have an Integrated Modular System for
   Terology (SMIT - Sistema Modular Integrado de Terologia) as a base
   platform. In addition, to collect, transmit and manage data, we also
   propose low-cost hardware devices and open-source software, with time
   series, Hidden Markov Models and genetic algorithms incorporated into
   them, to enable the prediction of new maintenance interventions. Another
   important development that is mentioned, with the objective of achieving
   a more effective terology system, is the implementation of 3D models to
   aid fault diagnosis and maintenance interventions in general. All these
   subjects are treated in this paper in a cohesive and synergistic way in
   order to achieve more effective terology management with an
   environmental perspective.}},

Abstract = {{Photoelastic methods exhibit important characteristics in identification
   and evaluation of stress distribution at specific points of a testing
   specimen or structural components. The literature reveals many
   photoelastic methods, as the classical photoelasticity, interferometric
   speckle and holography. Shadow moire methods can also give support to
   photoelastic techniques, offering many technical advantages as low cost
   equipment requirement. This research work compares stress distribution
   results obtained from a shadow moire technique with those obtained by
   the classical holographic photoelasticity showed by the pertinent
   literature. A cylindrical specimen painted with white opaque color was
   diametrically compressed by means of a rubber band, meanwhile an optical
   grid was projected onto the specimen surface. The shadow moire
   experimental setup included a 7.2 Mega Pixels digital camera, a Ronchi
   grid of 0.2 mm of period and as well as a conventional white light
   source. The results obtained with the shadow moire technique was
   compared with holographic method results previously analyzed by CRESPO
   (2.006) using similar specimen. It was concluded that the results
   generated by the shadow moire were in close agreement with the
   holographic method results.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the variety of hormonal treating regimes used, a proportion of
   cows with cystic ovarian disease (COD) fail to be cured. The hypothesis
   of this study was that cyst aspiration would improve the curing rate
   and/or accelerate the resumption of ovarian activity in affected cows.
   In four groups of cows the following treatments were administered: Group
   A (n = 18) only cyst aspiration, Group AGP (n = 19) cyst aspiration and
   a combination of GnRH and PGF(2 alpha), Group GP (n = 25) only GnRH and
   PGF(2 alpha), and Group C (n = 15) untreated control. Cysts were
   aspirated without ultrasonographic guidance, using a new device. All
   cows from Group AGP responded to treatment, while 5.5\% from Group A and
   16\% from Group GP remained anoestrous (P < 0.05). These refractory
   cases were re-treated with the AGP protocol and exhibited oestrus within
   12.4 +/- 1.1 days. The interval from PGF(2 alpha) injection to oestrus
   was significantly reduced in cows treated with cyst aspiration. Until
   day 80 post partum (pp), 11 of the 15 untreated cows (73.3\%) retained
   the initial cyst and remained anoestrous. It is concluded that
   persisting cases of COD can be treated by combining aspiration with a
   hormonal regime. The technique presented here has no complication for
   the cow, is efficient, easy, safe for the operator, and requires
   low-cost equipment.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Numerous methods have been developed to measure MRI gradient waveforms
   and k-space trajectories. The most promising new strategy appears to be
   magnetic field monitoring with RF microprobes. Multiple RF microprobes
   may record the magnetic field evolution associated with a wide variety
   of imaging pulse sequences. The method involves exciting one or more
   test samples and measuring the time evolution of magnetization through
   the FIDs. Two critical problems remain. The gradient waveform duration
   is limited by the sample T-2{*}, while the k-space maxima are limited by
   gradient dephasing.
   The method presented is based on pure phase encode FIDs and solves the
   above two problems in addition to permitting high strength gradient
   measurement. A small doped water phantom (1-3 mm droplet, T-1, T-2,
   T-2{*} < 100 mu s) within a microprobe is excited by a series of closely
   spaced broadband RF pulses each followed by FID single point
   acquisition. Two trial gradient waveforms have been chosen to illustrate
   the technique, neither of which could be measured by the conventional RF
   microprobe measurement. The first is an extended duration gradient
   waveform while the other illustrates the new method's ability to measure
   gradient waveforms with large net area and/or high amplitude. The new
   method is a point monitor with simple implementation and low cost
   hardware requirements. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Gaze is a natural input for a Human Computer Interface (HCI) for

   sequence of frames captured by low cost equipment. The procedure can be
   easily adapted to any subject and is adequately insensitive to changing
   of the illumination. The eye identification is performed on a piece-wise
   constant approximation of the frames. it is based on a discrete level
   set formulation of the variational approach to the optimal segmentation
   problem. This yields a simplified version of the original data retaining
   all the information relevant to the application. Tracking is obtained by
   a fast update of the optimal segmentation between successive frames. No
   eye movement model is required being the procedure fast enough to obtain
   the current frame segmentation as one step update from the previous

Title = {{Identification of Listeria Species Using a Low-Cost Surface-Enhanced

Abstract = {{We investigated the ability to distinguish between six species within
   the Listeria genus (including the human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes)
   based on a bacteria sample's surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)
   spectrum. Our measurement system consists of a portable low-cost Raman
   spectral acquisition unit and associated signal processing and
   classification modules. First, Listeria was cultured and then adsorbed
   onto silver colloidal nanoparticles for SERS measurements. A total of
   483 SERS spectra were collected and preprocessed (using a stationary
   wavelet transform decomposition) to remove noise and baseline artifact.
   Distinguishing features were extracted by retaining detail wavelet
   coefficients of significant value across multiple scales. Using a linear
   classifier in association with ``leave one out{''} cross-validation, the
   system achieved maximum classification accuracies of 96.1\%
   (six-category) and 97.9\% (two-category, L. monocytogenes versus all
   others). Dimensionality reduction was used to decrease the number of
   features from 74 to 5 while maintaining similar classification accuracy.
   In the future, it is envisioned that a measurement system such as this,
   which is a combination of low-cost hardware with sophisticated signal
   processing, could play a complementary role with existing methods in
   realizing a rapid inexpensive means of identifying food-borne bacterial
   pathogens.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an HDTV video decoder core that is able to decode
   MPEG-2, MPEG-4 AVC and VC-1 formats and is fully compatible with the
   Blu-ray Disc standard. The core has two major features which achieve
   low-cost hardware implementation for three different standards. First, a
   novel re-configurable architecture is adopted to realize reduced
   hardware for three different variable length coding tables. A hybrid
   architecture that consists of a cell array and coefficients memory is
   introduced. By considering the trade-off between performance and cost,
   the cell array can compare a variable number of bits in a flexible
   manner. Second, a data compression method suitable for all video
   decoding standards is applied to reduce memory data usage and access
   bandwidth. A compression syntax based on Run-Level encoding with
   Exp-Golomb tables is used to achieve both low compression workload and
   reasonable memory cost. The core is implemented by top-down HDL basis
   approach, and the circuit volume is 1.5Mgates with 90nm CMOS technology
   and operation clock-frequency is 162 MHz for 1080i at 30fr/s.}},

Abstract = {{Primary transmission protection technology is based on the
   characteristics of SONET/SDH protection mechanism which provides two
   fiber path rings. A serious problem may arise in the architecture when
   two fiber links are simultaneously broken. Mesh protection networks can
   support many protection paths to address above issue, but the key
   components of optical cross-connect (OXC) or photonic cross-connect
   (PXC) are expensive for network providers. Therefore. this study
   proposes a novel protection mechanism with a low-cost equipment of
   optical protection switching (OPS) for building a multiple path
   protection architecture on DWDM backbone network. The proposed mechanism
   is named the double 8-type OPS back to back protection mechanism. It
   call support eight protection paths to improve the issues of the
   low-path 1 + 1 dedicated ring and expensive mesh protection networks.
   This experiment demonstrates the automatic protection switching (APS)

Abstract = {{This article outlines new low-cost hardware set-ups as viable
   substitutes for conventionally employed cost-intensive impedance
   analyzers/LCR meters for implementation of the electro-mechanical

   basic low-cost equipment, such as function generator and digital
   multimeter, which are commonly available in most laboratories. Unlike
   the case of impedance analyzers/LCR meters, only the absolute admittance
   (i.e., magnitude) is measured. A simple computational approach is
   outlined for effective utilization of the absolute admittance function
   for SHM after filtering the passive component. Comparison of results
   with LCR measurements shows that the measurement accuracy of the
   proposed set-up is fairly good, repeatability excellent, and the damage
   sensitivity comparable to that of the cost-intensive conventional
   hardware. The proposed adaptation is, therefore a suitable candidate for
   the widespread industrial applications of the EMI technique.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the feasibility of the Adamkiewicz artery (AKA)
   detection by multidetector computed tomography (CT) data analysis
   without the need of a dedicated workstation, using low-cost hardware and
   the freeware OsiriX.
   Methods: CT scans of 67 patients undergoing a thoracic or
   thoraco-abdominal aortic procedure between April 2006 and August 2008
   were evaluated with respect to detection rate and AKA level and side
   using the OsiriX software version 3.2 on Mac OS X computer and compared
   to results obtained by standard workstation analysis, in a fully blinded
   analysis. The results were also compared with data compiled from a
   review of the English-language literature on this topic.
   Results: (1) AKA identification showed a substantia, agreement of
   85.07\% between the methods (k = 0.636). (2) The comparison of AKA Level
   showed a substantial agreement (weighted k = 0.661), with consensus in
   70.14\%. (3) From the literature review, we found that recognition of
   the AKA was achieved in 466 of 555 cases (83.96\%). (4) In 384 (83.3\%)
   cases the AKA originated from a left intercostal artery. (5) The
   proposed method and literature-compiled data showed a similar AKA level
   distribution.
   Conclusions: Noninvasive AKA location with open-source software and
   tow-cost hardware is feasible. The OsiriX software allows to effectively
   navigate through CT data not only to study the aorta, but also to detect
   the AKA, as in the case of the standard method and the literature data.
   Its availability and ease of use may contribute to make identification
   of the AKA part of the routine evaluation of CT scans in patients with
   aortic disease, even where dedicated workstations are not available,
   with potential benefits for planning therapeutic procedures. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{The evident need for improving access and safety controls has orientated
   the development of new personal identification systems towards using
   biometric, physiological and behavioral features guaranteeing increasing
   greater levels of performance. Motivated by this trend, the development
   and implementation of a computational tool for recording and validating
   people's identity using dorsum hand vein images is presented here. A
   low-cost hardware module for acquiring infrared images was thus
   designed; it consisted of a conventional video-camera, optical lenses,
   controlled infrared illumination sources and a frame grabber. he
   accompanying software module was concerned with visualizing and
   capturing images, selecting regions of interest, pattern segmentation in
   the region and extracting, describing and classifying these features. An
   artificial neuron network approach was implemented for pattern
   recognition, resulting in it proving the biometric indicator to be
   sufficiently discriminating, and a correlation-based approach using a
   100 image database for static characterisation, determined the system's
   maximum efficiency to be 95.72\% at a threshold equal to 65. False
   acceptance rate (FAR) was 8.57\% and false rejection rate (FRR) was 0\%

Abstract = {{Acceleration profile generation for jerk limitation is a major issue in
   automated industrial applications like computer numerical control (CNC)
   machinery and robotics. The automation machinery dynamics Should be kept
   as smooth as possible with suitable controllers where trajectory
   precision ensures quality while smoothness decreases machinery stress.
   During the operation of commercially available CNC and robotics
   controllers, small discontinuities on the dynamics are generated due to
   the controller position profiler which is generally based oil a
   trapezoidal velocity profile. These discontinuities can produce
   undesirable high-frequency harmonics on the position reference which
   consequentially can excite the natural frequencies of the mechanical
   structure and servomotors. Previous works have developed jerk limited
   trajectories with higher degree polynomial-based profiles, but lack one
   or both of computer efficiency for on-line operation and low-cost
   hardware implementation. The present work shows a low cost,
   computationally efficient, on-line hardware implementation of a
   high-degree polynomial-based profile generator with limited jerk
   dynamics for CNC machines and robotics applications to improve the
   machining process. The novelty of the paper is the development of a
   multiplier-free recursive algorithm for computationally efficient
   polynomial evaluation in profile generation and a low-cost
   implementation of the digital structure in field programmable gate array
   (FPGA). Two experimental setups were prepared in order to test the
   polynomial profile generator: the first one with the servomotor at no
   load and the second one for the servomotor driving a CNC milling machine
   axis. Front experimental results it is shown that higher degree
   polynomial profiles, compared to the standard trapezoidal speed profile
   improve the system dynamics by reducing peak jerk in more than one order
   of magnitude while precision is maintained the same and on-line
   operation is guaranteed. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Trained detectors are the most popular algorithms for the detection of
   vehicles or pedestrians in video sequences. To speed up the processing
   time the trained stages build a cascade of classifiers. Thereby the
   classifiers become more powerful from stage to stage. The most popular
   classifier for real-time applications is Adaboost applied to rectangular
   Haar-like features. The processing time of these detectors is short
   enough for real-time applications running on low cost hardware, but for
   difficult object classes the performance, especially for the later
   stages, drops. That is mainly due to the local rectangular features that
   cannot separate the object samples from the non-object samples,
   especially in later stages where the positive and negative samples
   become very similar. This paper deals with a new approach that combines
   the local weak features to global features, improving the separation
   capability of Adaboost classifiers significantly.}},

Abstract = {{Energy efficiency and low cost hardware are prerequisites for a
   successful deployment of wireless sensor networks. Many applications of
   wireless sensor networks require a transmission from sensor nodes to a
   common sink. A formation of node clusters and a hierarchical
   transmission scheme can be employed to increase the area that can be
   covered by the sensor network, which is limited by the transmission
   range of the nodes. Algorithms for node clustering usually assume that
   each sensor node potentially can take over the role of a cluster head.
   In this paper, it is assumed that only a pre-determined subset of all
   nodes is capable of becoming cluster head, resulting in decreased system
   complexity. A node clustering algorithm that accounts for this
   restriction is presented and the performance of a clustered sensor
   network for distributed detection is analyzed depending on the fraction
   of potential cluster head nodes.}},

Abstract = {{We address the problem of generating customized, controlled interference
   for experimental and testing purposes in Wireless Sensor Networks. The
   known coexistence problems between electronic devices sharing the same

   interference. The validation of these techniques and the assessment of
   protocols under external interference require the creation of
   reproducible and well-controlled interference patterns on real nodes, a
   non-trivial and time-consuming task.
   In this paper, we study methods to generate a precisely adjustable level
   of interference on a specific channel, with low-cost equipment and rapid
   calibration. We focus our work on the platforms carrying the CC2420
   radio chip. We show that, by setting the CC2420 in special mode, we can
   easily generate repeatable and precise patterns of interference.
   We show how this method is extremely useful for researchers to quickly
   investigate the behaviour of sensor network protocols and applications
   under different patterns of interference. We further evaluate the
   performance of our proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{The NetFPGA platform is designed to enable students and researchers to
   build networking systems that run at line-rate, and to create re-usable
   designs to share with others. Our goal is to eventually create a
   thriving developer-community, where developers around the world
   contribute reusable modules and designs for the benefit of the community
   as a whole. To this end, we have created a repository of ``User
   Contributed Designs{''} at NetFPGA.org. But creating an ``open-source
   hardware{''} platform is quite different from software oriented
   open-source projects. Designing hardware is much more time consuming and
   more error prone than designing software, and so demands a process that
   is more focussed on verifying that a module really works as advertised,
   else others will be reluctant to use it. We have designed a novel
   process for contributing new designs. Each contributed design is
   specified entirely by a set of tests it passes. A developer includes a
   list of tests that their design will pass, along with an executable set
   of tests that the user can check against. Through this process, we hope
   to establish the right expectations for someone who reuses a design, and
   to encourage sound design practices with solid, repeatable and
   integrated testing. In this paper we describe the philosophy behind our
   process, in the hope that others may learn from it, as well as describe
   the details of how someone contributes a new design to the NetFPGA
   repository.}},

   Mining application of low cost hardware real-time encoder in videophone
   with faces as ROI, this paper proposes a face detection algorithm to
   detect each macroblock (MB) as one part of a face or not. This face
   detection algorithm has a unique estimation-and-verification process and
   can he combined with a H.264 encoder by MB level pipeline architecture.
   97.91\% MBs in faces can be detected. VLSI architecture of proposed face
   detection algorithm is designed and an area of 4.3k gates is achieved.
   Power consumption is only l.45mW at 100MHz. A ROI based H.264 encoder
   with dynamic parameters is proposed to enhance subjective quality and
   reduce the rate-distortion-optimization (RDO) complexity. The PSNR in
   ROI increases for 4.8dB under similar bit rate. Encoding time is reduced
   to 54.4\% in videophone-like sequences.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents an on-going project that consists in providing
   low-cost telephony services in remote areas in the Amazon region, North
   Brazil. The idea is to build GSM networks using open-source and
   open-hardware projects, such as: OpenBTS, Openmoko, IP04, Asterisk and
   USRP. The NavegaPara Program, which currently connects thirteen cities
   in the state, provides the backbone network with optical fiber and
   digital radios. This paper summarizes the project and discusses the
   strategy adopted to circumvent a specific problem: the establishment of
   know-how on GSM technologies among engineering (electrical and computer)
   students. Several hands-on experiments in GSM technologies are being
   currently used and some are described here. For example, the work
   discusses how the Matlab toolkit GSMsim can be used to analyze digitized
   GSM waveforms. It also describes the development of a QAM modulator for
   better understanding the basics of GNU Radio. The success of the project
   will be measured by the effect in the life of citizens who, currently,
   do not have any access to a phone for basic communication needs.}},

   used for estimation/ correction steps. The design has been prototyped on
   an XC3S200A device in Spartan-3A Platform using ISE 10.1 all in one
   design suit from Xilinx. Synthesis results, floorplan mapping and
   testbench waveforms have been reported. Developing and validating the
   algorithm in VHDL and simulation phases have been explained. WiMAX

   that the receiver is relatively large because of the multiple antennas
   (typically 8 or 16) and it is computationally intensive to process the
   high frequency radio signals. Thus, it cannot be done on small,
   inexpensive radio tags. Instead, we propose to use the array on the
   transmitter side utilizing as few as three antennas. We use a radio
   interferometric technique to transform the useful phase information from
   the high frequency radio signal to a low frequency signal (< 1 kHz) that
   can be processed on low-cost hardware. Utilizing three anchors nodes
   with small antenna arrays, any number of low cost wireless nodes with
   single antennas can be accurately localized.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an efficient implementation scheme for the
   closed-loop speed control of an induction motor with constant V/f, slip
   regulation and incorporating `space vector pulse width modulation'
   (SVPWM). The system is an embedded system which incorporates an 8-bit
   reduced instruction set computer (MCU) to implement the speed control
   and the modulation scheme. Scalar control is inferior to the modern
   field oriented control in terms of efficiency and response time but it
   requires considerably lesser hardware resources. Use of space vector
   modulation as the modulation technique gives a better harmonic response
   and higher efficiency as compared to the normal regular sampled pulse
   width modulation techniques. The drive incorporates optimized algorithms
   and low cost hardware to provide a better cost-performance relationship.
   The system also includes features for the digital over-current
   protection and soft-starting of the motor.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic Programming (DP) is a popular and efficient method for
   calculating disparity maps from stereo images. It allows for meeting
   real-time constraints even on low-cost hardware. Therefore, it is
   frequently used in real-world applications, although more accurate
   algorithms exist. We present a refined DP stereo processing algorithm
   which is based on a standard implementation. However it is more flexible
   and shows increased performance. In particular, we introduce the idea of
   multi-path backtracking to exploit the information gained from DP more
   effectively. We show how to automatically tune all parameters of our
   approach offline by an evolutionary algorithm. The performance was
   assessed on benchmark data. The number of incorrect disparities was
   reduced by 40\% compared to the DP reference implementation while the
   overall complexity increased only slightly.}},

Abstract = {{Linked data structure (LDS) accesses art critical to the performance of
   many large scale applications. Techniques have been proposed to prefetch
   such accesses. Unfortunately, many LDS prefetching techniques 1)
   generate a large number of useless prefetches, thereby degrading
   performance and bandwidth efficiency, 2) require significant hardware or
   storage cost, or 3) when employed together with stream-based
   prefetchers, cause significant resource contention in the memory system.
   As a result, existing processors do not employ LDS prefetchers even
   though they commonly employ stream-based prefetchers.
   This paper proposes a low-cost hardware/software cooperative technique
   that enables bandwidth-efficient prefetching of linked data structures.
   Our solution has two new components: 1) a compiler-guided prefetch
   filtering mechanism that informs the hardware about which pointer
   addresses to prefetch, 2) a coordinated prefetcher throttling mechanism
   that uses run-time feedback to manage the interference between multiple
   prefetchers (LDS and stream-based) in a hybrid prefetching system.
   Evaluations show that the proposed solution improves average performance
   by 22.5\% while decreasing memory bandwidth consumption by 25\% over a
   baseline system that employs an effective stream prefetcher on a set of
   memory- and pointer-intensive applications. We compare our proposal to
   three different LDS/correlation prefetching techniques and find that it
   provides significantly better performance on both single-core and
   multi-core systems, while requiring less hardware cost.}},

Abstract = {{In today's society, collaboration between individuals and groups
   thousands of miles away has become increasingly common place. Due
   primarily to the rapid growth of broadband internet, cheap data storage
   and fast microchip technology, a new frontier has been opened where
   engineers and scientists can quickly and efficiently share large amounts
   of information with colleagues all across the globe. The implications of
   this technology have been and continue to become increasingly
   influential on the evolution of not just the sciences, but humanity as a
   whole. This paper will survey current successes that have been seen in
   open source software development and the emergent `open design' realm.
   From here, parallels are drawn between the two disciplines to illustrate
   how engineering organizations can benefit from the highly distributed
   nature that open source software has implemented. In this light, this
   paper will establish the position that engineering design must make the
   shift towards a more open and collaborative environment to stay relevant
   and prosper in the Information Age. Additionally, a basic web framework
   detailing the technologies needed to see such a shift occur will be
   outlined. Currently, there is some research being done in this area, but
   overall the possibilities for growth and innovation are significant.}},

Abstract = {{Due to poor motor system design or excessive safety factors, it is
   common to find oversized three-phase, squirrel-cage, induction motors,
   i.e., with a rated power higher than that actually necessary by the
   driven equipment. In those cases, if the oversizing level is
   significant, besides the unnecessary additional capital investment, the
   motors operate with poor efficiency and power factor, being an
   undesirable situation for the user. In this paper, an overview on the
   in-field motor load estimation methods is offered, being its importance
   evidenced. The simplest, low-cost, in-field methods to indirectly
   estimate the motor load are analyzed, being the focus on methods based
   upon the motor current, slip, and input power. Such methods require
   simple measurements with relatively low-cost equipment and information
   from the motor nameplate, manufacturers, catalogues, and/or databases,
   having a fair accuracy if applied to specific motors and load ranges.
   Some improvements in those methods are proposed to increase their
   accuracy, including combined solutions. A new definition of ``useful
   accuracy{''} is introduced, for evaluation of the effectiveness or
   adequacy of the motor load estimation methods.}},

   fashion as free and open-source software. Facilitated by advances in
   information technology software and hardware, new ways to disseminate
   information such as wikis and Internet-enabled mobile phones, the global
   development of OSAT has emerged as a reality. This paper shows the
   sharing of design processes, appropriate tools, and technical
   information is enables more effective and rapid development of
   appropriate technologies for both industrialized and non-industrialized
   regions. This sharing will require the appropriate technology community
   to adopt open standards/licenses, document knowledge, and build on
   previous work. This paper offers solutions in the form of both business
   models and tools to overcome technical constraints of OSAT development
   in the forms of the platforms necessary on which to share and build
   knowledge about appropriate technologies. These solutions are open,
   easily accessible for those in need, have a low barrier to entry for
   both users and information creators, and must be vetted in order to

Abstract = {{Thermal models used in overload protection relays often fail to predict
   the rotor temperature for motors with impaired cooling conditions. In
   this case, the temperature estimated from the rotor resistance can be
   used as an indicator of the motor's cooling capability. However, this
   estimated rotor temperature is often corrupted by estimation error due
   to the asymmetry in the power supply. A detailed analysis of the
   trajectories of the complex current and voltage space vectors in a
   synchronous reference frame is presented in this paper, and the negative
   sequence fundamental frequency components are identified as the major
   cause of the estimation error. Based on this analysis, a fast and
   efficient algorithm is proposed to calculate the rotor temperature for
   line-connected induction machines. By applying the Goertzel algorithm to
   the complex current and voltage space vectors, constructed directly from
   the motor terminal measurements, the positive sequence fundamental
   frequency components are extracted, and the rotor temperature is then
   estimated with significantly reduced estimation error. Compared to the
   conventional scheme based on the fast Fourier transform, the proposed
   algorithm is faster and more efficient, and is therefore more suitable
   for implementation on a low-cost hardware platform.}},

Number = {{3-4}},

Abstract = {{A new finishing mode has been utilized as an effective finishing tool
   design with an electrode and a nonconductive grindstone to execute
   grinding and electrochemical smoothing synchronously. This mode can be
   used for various end-turning operations. Through simple equipment
   attachment, grinding and electrochemical smoothing can follow the
   cutting process on the same machine. Among the factors affecting
   electrochemical smoothing, grinding performance combined with
   electrochemical smoothing, is primarily discussed. In the experiment,
   different types of electrodes are used with continuous and pulsed direct
   current. The control factors include die material, chemical composition,
   and concentration of the electrolyte. The experimental parameters are
   finish tool and workpiece rotational speed, flow rate of electrolytes,
   gap width between electrode and workpiece, electrical current density
   and pulsed period, and finishing tool geometry. High workpiece and
   electrode rotational speed produces a better finish. A thin electrode is
   associated with higher current density and provides larger discharge
   space for a better finish. Pulsed direct current can promote the effect
   of electrochemical finishing. Decreasing the height of the finish tool
   to a partial-form tool is associated with less restricted electrolyte
   flow and more discharge space, which creates better finishes than the
   full-form tools. The grindstone, with an adequately convex shape, also
   appeared to have an adequate initial gap width between the electrode and
   workpiece, which matches enough current density and obtains a better
   finish. The most effective geometric design for the finishing tool and
   the advantage of the low-cost equipment in electrochemical smoothing,
   following end-turning, is investigated in this study.}},

Abstract = {{An alternative method of signal frequency measurement based on the
   direct frequency comparison principle is presented. Based on a model of
   its measuring process, it is shown that the resulting measurement is a
   rational approximation to the true value, and that this approximation
   has a higher accuracy than approximations by systematic fractions. The
   properties of mediant fractions are used in the measurement model for
   two given fractions. The results obtained from the simulation of the
   measurement model are presented. It is shown that the accuracy of
   frequency measurement that can be obtained with this method is
   equivalent to the repeatability of the atomic standard of frequency and
   time. This method can be implemented in a short time using low cost

Abstract = {{This paper describes the High Bandwidth High Throughput (HBHT)
   Government Reference Architecture (GRA) effort and utilization of
   Dependency Structure Matrix (DSM) tools to validate the architecture.
   This paper is intended to show how the development of GRA compliant
   modules advances both new and time-tested technologies through
   establishing a standard for Above 2 GHz SATCOM Terminal modules. The
   paper will also describe plans to develop and apply tools, products and
   solutions to validate the GRA.
   The paper describes the process associated with engaging industry in
   developing the GRA. Functional Decomposition, validating the GRA through
   a prototype, creating the GRA as a standard for the Army HC3 Program,
   and managing to that architecture and standard in a development
   environment. The paper also describes how GRA validation through use of
   DSM tools, such as LATTIX, will aid in the development and testing of a
   GRA Hardware and Software Interface Test Development Environment
   designed to allow a GRA module developer to develop, interface, and test
   interface applications to the GRA compatible open hardware/software
   interfaces. Full documentation shall be developed for all open hardware
   and software interfaces, sufficient to develop applications with minimum
   interface or interaction with the module developer. Interface definition
   stability over time will be a key factor in the mission success of the
   HC3 open system interfaces, so they must be designed with stability and
   longevity in mind.
   This paper will review alternatives for validation of GRA compliant
   modules. Particular emphasis will be placed on DSM techniques. The
   interdependencies between modules will be modeled using a DSM so as to
   provide a big picture view of GRA. DSM can also be used to model and
   expose key design decisions for the entire team. Rules can be
   established in the DSM model for GRA compliance to guide a GRA module
   developer during development and testing for validation. The use of DSM
   to model various hardware and software modules in the HBHT will create a
   common artifact that can be shared across various teams with different
   skills and domains of expertise. DSM can also be used to analyze the
   impact of change. Over time, DSM will provide a blue print of the
   architecture and how it evolves to meet changing needs.}},

Abstract = {{The humanity is currently facing the difficulties of an aged society
   with an ever-growing predominance of chronic diseases and associated
   problems (e.g., mobility issues, possibility of falls, etc.).
   Traditional hospital or clinical internment is not an efficient answer
   both in terms of human, therapeutic or economical aspects.
   Alternatively, ambulatory and home healthcare are becoming preferred and
   predominant solutions. However, the typical home environment is not
   suited nor prepared for monitoring and helping to take care of elderly
   and/or disabled people. To overcome some of these issues, this paper
   proposes a wireless low cost hardware solution based on a
   microcontroller with several sensors (cf. temperature, oxymeter, 3-axis
   accelerometer) which allows monitoring several physiological parameters
   (e.g., temperature, heart bit, etc.) and infer human activities (e.g.,
   standing, walking, falling, etc.) of home confined people. A similar
   platform with ambient temperature and light sensors was also created for
   monitoring the home environment. The collected data is pre-processed on
   the sensor nodes and then transmitted to a wireless gateway allowing the
   backend system to log the patient activity, his health condition as well
   as the living surroundings. Finally, a web application is provided to
   healthcare professionals for viewing, analyzing and statistically
   operating this information, thus empowering homecare.}},

   problem of (simultaneously) three-dimensional (3-D) attitude, position
   and relative motion determination by using two-dimensional (2-D)
   intensity image measurement. Here we shall apply this method to a
   relatively new field, namely the problem of tracking and surveillance of
   moving vehicle. A solution to this problem that uses two-dimensional,
   intensity images from a single camera is desirable for real-time
   applications. A single camera is advantageous because a standard video
   camera is low in cost, setup and calibration are simple, physical space
   requirements are small, reliability is high, and low-cost hardware is
   available for digitizing and processing the images. In this paper,
   solutions to the remote measurement (using a single camera) problem for
   a dynamic system given a sequence of 2-D intensity images of an object
   are provided for both of the cases where feature positions of the object
   are known relative to a base reference frame and where feature positions
   are unknown relative to a base reference frame. In both cases, the
   location of the base reference frame is calculated in a timely manner by
   using the differential GPS positioning concept, where the DGPS

Abstract = {{In this paper, a system concept is proposed to realize low-complexity
   three dimensional indoor positioning using Ultra-WideBand radio signals.
   Range measurements are obtained based on the first path power of the
   received signal, where no synchronization between the system nodes is
   needed neither a receiver clock offset needs to be estimated, and only a
   modest sampling rate is required. The unknown user position coordinates
   are estimated with a new 1-D iterative (1DI) method, where the n-D
   positioning problem is first reduced to one dimension, and then solved
   iteratively. Compared to the classic Gauss-Newton method, as routinely
   used in satellite navigation, the computations in each iteration are
   greatly reduced, e. g. a reduction of up to 67\% for a three dimensional
   system. Hence, the proposed system offers potential for low-cost
   hardware implementation and is fairly light on position computational
   load. Validation is performed based on actual UWB radio measurements
   collected in typical office environments, with signal bandwidths varying
   from 0.5 to 7.5 GHz. Results show that the achievable standard deviation
   of the range error is 0.28 m, much better than what can be achieved with
   classical received signal strength estimation. With proper range
   measurement weight matrices, the 1DI method performs similarly as the
   Gauss-Newton method (in terms of root mean squared error) and is better
   than any other low-complexity algorithm from literature. With the
   proposed system, the standard deviation of the position coordinate error
   on one axis can come down to 0.14 m.}},

Abstract = {{Cable tension force is one of the most important structural parameters
   to monitor in cable-stayed bridges. For example, cable tension needs to
   be monitored during construction and maintenance to ensure the bridge is
   not overloaded. To economically monitor tension forces, this study
   proposes the use of an automated wireless tension force estimation
   system (WFTES) developed solely for cable force estimation. The design
   of the WFTES system can be divided into two parts: low-cost hardware and
   automated software. The low-cost hardware consists of an integrated
   platform containing a wireless sensing unit constructed from commercial
   off-the-shelf components, a low-cost commercial MEMS accelerometer, and
   a signal conditioning board for signal amplification and filtering. With
   respect to the automated software, a vibration-based algorithm using
   estimated modal parameters and information on the cable sag and bending
   stiffness is embedded into the wireless sensing unit. Since modal
   parameters are inputs to the algorithm, additional algorithms are
   necessary to extract modal features from measured cable accelerations.
   To validate the proposed WFTES, a scaled-down cable model was
   constructed in the laboratory using steel rope wire. The wire was
   exposed to broad-band excitations while the WFTES recorded the cable
   response and embedded algorithms interrogated the measured acceleration
   to estimate tension force. The results reveal the embedded algorithms
   properly identify the lower natural frequencies of the cable and make
   accurate estimates of cable tension. This paper concludes with a summary
   of the salient research findings and suggestions for future work.}},

Abstract = {{The emission of basal shoots is a characteristic of hazelnut (Corylus
   avellana L.). Their presence causes problems both to plants and to crop
   management. Cultivated trees require many applications, manual or
   mechanical, to eliminate suckers every year. De-suckering can be done on
   herbaceous or lignified suckers. Different methods can be used ranging
   from mechanical to physical and chemical ones. A thermal control
   management is a recently investigated procedure. To establish the
   effectiveness of thermal control techniques, de-suckering tests with
   steam and flame were performed in a hazelnut orchard, with cv. `Tonda
   Gentile Romana' at a 5x5m plant spacing. A short blast of intense heat
   was directed on the target, scalding sucker tissues so that, in a few
   days, vegetation wilted and died. A small steam generator-applicator
   machine was used. Steam flows at approximately 300 C out of the boiler
   and can be directed through a hand-held outlet pipe, with or without a
   special application device. Flaming was carried out with two models of
   tractor-drawn equipment, the first with handheld torches and the second
   with a flame-head torch assembly for automatic application. Parameters
   for heat contact-time were: 60 s, 30 s for the first three, and 6 s for
   the automatic flaming. Steam and flame were compared for de-suckering
   effectiveness, evaluated after 15 days. Results suggest that flame is
   more efficient, especially with handheld torches, steam gave a good
   result but vapour cooling through rapid condensation may reduce
   effectiveness. Flaming is easy to use, has low cost equipment and low
   fuel consumption. Steam application has slow speed, big amounts of water
   and fuel, and expensive equipment, but collective ownership of devices
   may be an option. No damage to plants was observed.}},

Abstract = {{A hardware oriented Motion Estimation (ME) algorithm which can be
   combined into FPGA based SDTV or HDTV encoder is proposed. The present
   Full Search (FS) algorithm cost too much logic resource, thus it limits
   the application of real time video encoder. And all of the fast
   algorithms are difficult to reuse data between candidates, thus they are
   not suitable for ASIC or FPGA implementation. After reviewing the
   previous ME algorithms and researching the distribution of Motion Vector
   (MV), we optimize the hardware ME by selecting block-matching candidates
   in the Search Window (SW). Then a novel Big-Hexagon-Like searching route
   is proposed. And the number of PE arrays is decreased from 8 to 2.
   Therefore, the high logic resource cost of ME is alleviated notably. And
   the method of data reusing is also proposed. Then a hardware
   architecture is proposed. We have tested the proposal with High
   definition, CIF and QCIF video sequences. Comparing the test result with
   F017 and Diamond algorithms, the proposal has a comparative RDO
   (Rate-Distortion Optimization) performance to F017 and is better than
   Diamond which is adopted by T264. An FPGA implementation of the proposed
   algorithm is realized, the result of implementation shows that the
   equivalent gates count is reduced to 121K.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the fast one-dimensional (1-D) algorithms and their

   transforms of H.264/AVC and the 1-D 8 x 8 inverse transform of AVS are
   proposed with the low hardware cost, especially for the multiple
   decoding applications in China. By sharing the hardware, the proposed
   1-D hardware sharing architecture is realized by adding the offset
   computations, and it is implemented with the pipelined architecture.
   Thus, the hardware cost of the proposed sharing architecture is smaller
   than that of the individual and separate designs. With regular

Abstract = {{Simultaneous recording of electrophysiology and functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) is a technique of growing importance in
   neuroscience. Rapidly evolving clinical and scientific requirements have
   created a need for hardware and software that can be customized for
   specific applications. Hardware may require customization to enable a
   variety of recording types (e.g., electroencephalogram, local field
   potentials, or multi-unit activity) while meeting the stringent and
   costly requirements of MRI safety and compatibility. Real-time signal
   processing tools are an enabling technology for studies of learning,
   attention, sleep, epilepsy, neurofeedback, and neuropharmacology, yet
   real-time signal processing tools are difficult to develop. We describe
   an open-source system for simultaneous electrophysiology and fMRI
   featuring low-noise (< 0.6 mu V p-p input noise), electromagnetic
   compatibility for MRI (tested up to 7T), and user-programmable real-time
   signal processing. The hardware distribution provides the complete
   specifications required to build an MRI-compatible electrophysiological
   data acquisition system, including circuit schematics, print circuit
   board (PCB) layouts, Gerber files for PCB fabrication and robotic
   assembly, a bill of materials with part numbers, data sheets, and vendor
   information, and test procedures. The software facilitates rapid
   implementation of real-time signal processing algorithms. This system
   has been used in human EEG/fMRI studies at 3 and 7T examining the
   auditory system, visual system, sleep physiology, and anesthesia, as
   well as in intracranial electrophysiological studies of the non-human
   primate visual system during 3T fMRI, and in human hyperbaric physiology
   studies at depths of up to 300 feet below sea level. Published by

Abstract = {{Methods to determine cytokine protein content in samples of interest,
   such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), are often
   labor-intensive and costly. Furthermore, because ELISA requires
   relatively large sample volumes and protein concentrations, it is
   difficult using this technique to determine protein content for multiple
   cytokines from individual samples. Recently, Luminex has developed an
   open source hardware platform combining flow cytometry- and bead-based
   antibody capture that is capable of detecting multiple analytes from a
   single sample. In the present study we employed the Luminex 2000
   platform to determine the cytokine protein content in discrete brain
   regions of C57BL/6J mice. In spike-and-recovery experiments, known
   concentrations of murine recombinant interleukin (IL)-1, 1 beta, IL-6,
   and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha were added either singly or as a
   mixture of all three to whole brain homogenates containing known
   quantities of total protein. Spiked samples were assayed for either a
   single cytokine or for multiple cytokines using 1-plex or 3-plex assay
   kits, respectively. In whole mouse brain homogenate we recovered between
   81\% and 103\% of the recombinant cytokines. We then injected C57BL/6J
   mice intraperitoneally with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and
   sacrificed them 4 h later. We detected in samples taken from
   LPS-stimulated mice 4- to 870-fold increases in serum or spleen cytokine
   protein, and 1.5- to 16-fold increases in cytokine protein in discrete
   brain regions, relative to protein content in samples obtained from
   vehicle-treated animals. These results indicate that multiple cytokines
   may be reliably assayed from discrete regions of mouse brain using a
   single sample. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the authors present an implementation of a plug-n-play
   web sensor based on a web service approach, utilizing the extensible
   markup language, which is an open-source software, to exchange
   information and adopting a low-cost hardware. After an introduction to
   the web service technology, the problem of the dynamic services and one
   possible solution will be presented. The proposed solution allows us to
   have, at all times, an overview of the state of connected sensors and of
   the available services. Thus, when a new sensor is inserted in the
   network, its services are automatically ``published{''} without
   reconfiguring the net; this is important with sensor networks, which are
   frequently upgraded. The sensor is presented in the framework of a
   hierarchical distributed system for metrological monitoring
   applications. Particular attention is devoted to synchronization
   problems among all composing devices of the proposed distributed system,
   taking into account the characteristics of main synchronization
   standards. Measurement results supplied by the sensors are made
   available as web services so that all users can build up their own
   applications. To show some preliminary results of the proposed
   distributed monitoring network, the monitoring of rms values in
   three-phase power networks was analyzed. A proper synchronization
   protocol was adopted in order to synchronize the different hardware
   sections of a sensor to perform a particular measurement.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the complexity of multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) wireless
   channels, direct measurement is the main viable option for accurate
   characterization. Details on a new low-cost wideband channel sounder are

   commercial channel sounders and has modest cost (< US\$ 50000). The
   sounder operates in the 2- to 8-GHz range with up to 100 MHz of
   instantaneous bandwidth and supports eight transmitters and receivers,
   which are sufficient to support the development and assessment of
   current and future MIMO wireless systems. In this ``open-hardware{''}
   project, the hardware design and software components are openly

Abstract = {{To design the hardware for image signal processing pipelines in digital
   still cameras (DSCs) and video camcoders, it is a dilemma for
   conventional solutions, such as application-specific integrated circuits
   (ASICs) and digital signal processors (DSPs), to achieve high processing
   capability at low cost while maintaining high flexibility for various
   algorithms. With the observation of the characteristics of image
   signal-processing pipelines, including the different requirements for
   different operation modes and the algorithmic similarity of
   image-processing tasks, a new coarse-grained reconfigurable image stream
   processor (CRISP) is proposed in this paper. The design idea is to
   devote low-cost hardware for the requirements in the preview mode and
   add some hardware resources for higher flexibility and processing
   capability in the picture-taking mode. With the coarse-grained
   reconfigurable stage processing elements designed for image
   signal-processing tasks and the reconfigurable interconnection unit with
   unified communication protocol, CRISP can be reconfigured as an
   efficient dedicated hardware in the preview mode, and it can act like a
   flexible DSP for the picture-taking mode with different contexts.
   Implementation result shows that the core (die) size is 5 mm(2) (7.72
   mm(2)) with TSMC 0.18-mu m process, and the power consumption is 218 mW
   at 1.8 V. At the working frequency of 115 MHz, the processor is capable
   of processing 11 M-pixel still images at 10 fps for DSCs or 1920 x 1080
   video frames at 55 fps for camcorders. CRISP can execute image pipelines
   83 times faster than the state-of-the-art DSP with only about one-tenth
   die size.}},

Abstract = {{Portable image acquisition devices often operate in challenging outdoor
   environments. The quality of the acquired scenes is often low due to the
   low dynamics of current sensors. Moreover, these sensors are typically
   equipped with low-cost hardware. Hence, the image-enhancement algorithms
   are bounded to work in real time,using limited resources and possibly
   require low power. We introduce a novel method to enhance the digital
   images acquired in critical lighting conditions, producing high-quality
   images for most applications. Our algorithm separates the image into
   illumination and reflectance, as in the ``Retinex{''} theory. These two
   channels are separately processed since they give different
   contributions to the image. We propose a simple and fast operator to
   estimate the illumination component employing a spatially recursive
   rational filter. We show some results of an extensive experimental phase
   to show that to separately process the illumination and reflectance
   channels is advantageous since the image features are better exploited.
   A number of measures are computed to validate our choices.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-parametric model-based control (mp-MPC) is a control method that
   is widely acknowledged for its ability to solve the on-line optimisation
   problem, involved in traditional MPC, off-line via parametric
   optimisation. Its main advantage is that it obtains the control actions
   as explicit functions of the plant measurements. This allows for the
   control actions to be obtained on-line via simple function evaluations
   instead of solving repetitively a computationally demanding on-line
   optimisation. This allows mp-MPC to be implemented on the simplest,
   low-cost hardware. In this paper we report on recent developments on
   industrial and experimental applications of mp-MPC where the ability of
   mp-MPC to be applied on systems with fast dynamics and sampling times is
   demonstrated, which maybe prohibitive for traditional MPC that relies on
   on-line optimisation methods. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Processing methods used in photonics and nanotechnology have many
   limitations hindering the ability to realize devices and restricting the
   actual number of applications. An ideal processing method should require
   low-cost equipment, be able to produce very fine details, and be
   scalable to process large area specimens in an acceptable amount of
   time. Proximity field nanopatterning (PnP) is a lithography method
   possessing these features. By using interference patterns produced by a
   two-dimensional phase mask, the technique is able to generate a
   submicron detailed exposure on a millimeter-size slab of light sensitive
   photopolymer, which is then developed like a photographic plate to
   reveal three-dimensional interference patterns from the phase mask.
   While it is possible to use computer aided simulations to obtain the
   interference patterns produced by a mask with a certain pattern, the
   inverse problem of producing a mask for a desired interference pattern
   cannot be solved in the same way due to the intricacies of light
   interactions involved in producing the final interference pattern. An
   alternative method is to iteratively optimize the phase mask so that the
   interference patterns obtained converge to the desired pattern. The
   method is elaborated in this article. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In forensic science, automated firearms identification is an important
   and yet unsolved problem. On the way to the solution, one of the most
   important phases is data acquisition. To be able to identify firearms in
   a reliable way, all the striated and impressed marks on metallic
   surfaces of cartridge cases should be visible. But two-dimensional
   images of cartridge cases are very sensitive to the type and direction
   of the light source(s). Depending on illumination conditions, the images
   of marks change drastically and sometimes they simply disappear. But, if
   the three-dimensional (31)) topography of the surface is obtained, the
   geometry of the marks, which is independent of the illumination, is
   available. Thus, by providing illumination independent features that can
   be used for automated matching, 3D data have the potential to make
   automated matching much reliable. In the literature on data acquisition
   for automated firearms identification, a few different ways of
   three-dimensional surface extraction are described, like laser
   interferometry or laser profilometry. This Study presents a real life
   application of another method, photometric stereo, for the acquisition
   of 3D topographic data for cartridge cases, which is the one used in
   BALISTIKA Ballistics Image Analysis and Recognition System. In order to
   construct 3D topographic data, first of all, two-dimensional images were
   acquired using a specially designed set-up. After the images were
   calibrated radiometrically, photometric stereo method was applied. In
   order to minimize the low-frequency errors in the final surface, a
   surface-fitting algorithm was used. The method uses low-cost equipment
   and image acquisition is not time-consuming. Results were compared to
   interferometric measurement values for error assessment. (C) 2007

   Project (3GPP) turbo coding algorithm is presented. The interleaver is a
   key component of turbo codes and it is used to minimize the effect of

   consumes a large part of silicon area in the design of turbo encoder and
   decoder. The presented hardware interleaver architecture utilizes the
   algorithmic level hardware simplifications as well as the iterative
   modulo computation to achieve very low cost solution. After doing the
   hardware multiplexing and optimization the proposed architecture
   consumes only 1.5 k gates (without pre-computation) and 2.2 k gates
   (with pre-computation). In both cases the interleaved address is
   computed every clock cycle except the case of pruning, in which one

Abstract = {{The demand for reliable indoor positioning of mobile devices is wide and
   the computing and communication hardware are evolving rapidly. Thus, it
   is meaningful to consider a spectrum of techniques that reflect
   different constraints and tradeoffs of hardware investment,
   computational complexity, set-up cost, and positioning accuracy. The
   present paper strives to achieve high accuracy with low hardware
   investment and moderate set-up cost, but with somewhat sophisticated
   computations. We not only describe a successful positioning system, but
   also suggest a set of formal techniques that proved to work well in the
   real setting, and can be implemented using standard wireless sensor
   network hardware. The overall philosophy of utilizing the full
   distribution information of signal measurements at each location (proved
   implementable after careful algorithm design) distinguishes sharply from
   most existing works. Compared with the earlier work within our group,
   the present paper introduces new elements such as profiling the signal
   measurement distributions over the coverage area using a special
   interpolation technique; a two-tier tracking scheme that improves the
   efficiency of localization (in the commonly used sense) by adding
   movement defection (lower energy cost); and the joint clusterhead
   placement optimization for both localization and movement detection.
   Experimentally, our system achieved an accuracy equivalent to 95\% < 5
   meters and 87\% < 3 meters, which should be considered a high-quality
   result compared to well-known contemporary systems that use similar
   low-cost hardware.}},

Abstract = {{Hand gestures play a natural and intuitive communication mode for all
   human dialogs. The use of human movements, especially hand gestures, has
   become an important part of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) in recent
   years. Among natural human gestures occurring during non-verbal
   communication, pointing gesture can be easily recognized and included in
   more natural new human computer interfaces. Researchers have proposed
   many systems based on pointing gesture for HCI. Theses systems, however,
   share the same elements such as a video projector, a camera and a planar
   surface. Unlike these existing approaches, a novel approach to pointing
   gestures recognition based on binocular stereo vision is developed. The
   pointing direction is based on the line of sight connecting the point of
   pseudo-eyes. The mentioned model does not constrain the flat surface
   pointed to by user to be visible by the cameras. The unique feature of
   our system is that cameras do not need to capture entire bodies and
   faces. Experimental results show that the system works in real time on a
   low cost hardware platform. It is fairly accurate and independent of
   user characteristics and environmental changes.}},

Abstract = {{Sensor network applications are generally characterized by long idle
   durations and intermittent communication patterns. The traffic loads are
   typically so low that overall the idle duration energy consumption
   dominates. Low duty cycle MAC protocols are used to reduce the idle
   duration energy consumption. However, lowering down the duty cycle in
   favour of energy consumption results in increased latency, which makes
   it undesirable for many applications. In this paper, we propose Radio
   Triggered Wake-up with Addressing Capabilities (RTWAC) that allows
   suppressing the idle duration current consumption. Our solution consists
   of an external low-cost hardware wake-up circuit attached to the
   microcontroller of a sensor node. The sensor node stays in the sleep
   mode with its normal communication radio turned off. In order to
   communicate with a sensor node, a special kind of out-of-band modulated
   wake-up signal is transmitted. The modulated signal contains data that
   enables to distinguish between differently addressed nodes in order to
   avoid undesired node wake-ups. Furthermore, we augment this solution to
   a MAC protocol running on the normal radio on the sensor node in an
   advantageous way to achieve high energy gains and low latency for data
   communication.}},

   tree limb. We have employed a seismic sensor to detect vibrations
   generated by footsteps and vehicles. A geophone is an inexpensive sensor
   which provides easy and instant deployment as well as long range
   detection capability. We have also designed a low power, low noise, and
   low cost hardware solution to process seismic waves locally where the
   sensor is located and wireless capability of the system makes it to
   communicate with a remote command center.
   Temporal features of the vibration signals were modeled by the Dynamic
   Synapse Neural network (DSNN) using data recorded in the deserts of
   Joshua Tree, CA. The system showed 1.7\% false recognition rate for the
   recognition of human footsteps, 6.7\% for vehicle, and 0.0\% for
   background. The models were able to reject quadrupedal animal's
   footsteps (in this study a trained dog). The system rejected dog's
   footsteps with 0.02\% false recognition rate.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present a novel radio location system for indoor
   tracking and navigation. The system has been designed for applications
   such as emergency first responders where high accuracy is required, all
   nodes have only wireless connections, and the system must be able to be
   rapidly deployed. The application requirements are best satisfied using
   time-of-arrival based radio location, however the challenge is to do
   this at low cost. Specific issues addressed by the system include
   achieving frequency and time synchronization using low cost oscillators
   in each node and overcoming the variable propagation delay in the analog
   electronics from the use of low cost radio components, while operating
   in an environment characterized by strong multipath interference. Our
   approach has been to use low cost highly integrated electronic
   components and to use sophisticated signal processing to compensate for
   the limitations in the radio electronics. The system has been
   implemented and we demonstrate a median error of 0.15 m outdoors and
   0.49 m in an indoor office environment with measurements performed
   through multiple walls.}},

   applying the concepts of ``learning by projects{''}. In this context,
   the LEGO (R) MINDSTORMS (R) NXT modular robot appears as a simple,

   challenge in many domains of information technologies, especially in
   real-time control. The project team can operate with the real system
   (e.g. constructed robot) to realize a number of particular tasks. The
   ready-to-use embedded platform and dual microcontrollers architecture
   represents actual trends in the modern control systems designs. The open
   hardware and software architecture gives unlimited possibility to handle
   all devices connected to the main control brick and write effective
   control algorithms.
   The proposed rescue robot project is a good example of the simple system
   where, a number of real-time control problems can be analyzed. The
   project on this scale requires detailed planning, cooperation in teams,
   extensive literature survey, and comprehensive software design. That is

Abstract = {{A most effective design system and an advantage of low cost equipment
   using synchronous processes of electrochemical finishing and burnishing
   for a freeform surface following turning machining is investigated. The
   proposed design process uses a feeding finish-tool instead of the mate
   electrode as in conventional EM Hence higher electrical current is not
   required when the effective design electrode is used to reduce the
   response area. Through simple equipment attachment, electrochemical
   finishing can follow the traditional turning on the same machine. The
   controlled factors include the chemical composition and concentration of
   the electrolyte, die material. and rotational speed of workpiece. The
   design finish-tool is primarily discussed among the factors affecting
   the synchronous processes of electrochemical finishing and burnishing.
   The experimental parameters are initial gap width, flow rate of
   electrolyte, current rating, feed rate of finish tool, pulsed period,
   and the evaluation of different process features. The use of large
   electrolytic flow rate is advantageous to the finish effect. High
   rotational speed of the finish tool produces better finish. The finish
   effect is better with longer off-time because discharge of finish dregs
   becomes easier. Higher current rating with quicker feed rate of finish
   tool effectively reaches the fast improvement of the surface roughness
   of the workpiece is recommend in current study. The effective design
   finish-tool with an electrode of a globe-form and a burnishing tool of a
   pin-form have an optimal value for higher current density and provides
   larger discharge space, which produces a smoother surface. The
   synchronous processes of electrochemical finishing and burnishing just
   needs only a short time to make the workpiece smooth and bright and
   saves the need for the precise process of traditional machining is
   recommended for the finish process of the freeform surface.}},

   consuming and computing capacity of a mobile phone, a background
   subtraction algorithm is presented for adaptation. Then, a self-adaptive
   background model that can update automatically and timely to adapt to
   the slow and slight changes of natural environment is detailed. When the
   subtraction of the current captured image and the background reaches a
   certain threshold, a moving object is considered to be in the current
   view, and the mobile phone will automatically notify the central control
   unit or the user through phone call, SMS (Short Message System) or other
   means. The proposed algorithm can be implemented in an embedded system
   with little memory consumption and storage space, so it's feasible for
   mobile phones and other embedded platforms, and the proposed solution
   can be used in constructing mobile security monitoring system with
   low-cost hardware and equipments. Based on J2ME (Java2 Micro Edition)
   technology, a prototype system was developed using JSR135 (Java
   Specification Requests 135: Mobile Media API) and JSR120 (Java
   Specification Requests 120: Wireless Messaging API) and the test results
   show the effectiveness of proposed solution.}},

   non-invasive method for real time detection of a subject eyes in a
   sequence of frames captured by low cost equipment. The procedure can be

   approximation procedure of the frames based on a discrete level set
   formulation of the variational approach to the optimal segmentation
   problem. The segmentation yields a simplified version of the original
   data retaining all the information relevant to the application. No eye

Abstract = {{A fiber Bragg grating sensor for simultaneous static and dynamic strain
   detection is hereby presented. The principle of operation of the
   interrogator is based on direct intensity detection: a fixed-wavelength
   laser source is filtered through the sensing element, and the Output
   power is detected with a photodiode. Multiple sensing for
   matched-wavelength gratings is performed by splitting the source into
   multiple channels. The exploitation of cheap components for optical
   telecommunications results in a low-cost hardware solution that matches
   several budget-constrained applications. The optical sensor is
   complemented by signal processing techniques (adaptive filters, spectral
   estimation, data modeling), capable of improving performances of the
   system without changing the optical layout.
   The system has been tested both in static interrogation, as a
   temperature sensor, and as vibration detector in a typical structural
   monitoring context. The maximum interrogation range is -200 mu epsilon,
   depending on the grating shape, with a resolution <<1 mu epsilon and a
   repeatability of similar to 1\%. A 1\% stability over long time has been
   assessed with a long-term test. The adaptive filtering improves the
   signal-to-noise ratio of 53 dB. The resolution-unlimited spectral
   estimator resolves resonance peak detection for a vibration of 0.1 mu
   epsilon.}},

Abstract = {{In order to provide security for a device, cryptographic algorithms are
   implemented on them. Even devices using a cryptographically secure
   algorithm may be vulnerable to implementation attacks like side channel
   analysis or fault attacks. Most fault attacks on RSA concentrate on the
   vulnerability of the Chinese Remainder Theorem to fault injections. A
   few other attacks on RSA which do not use this speed-up technique have
   been published. Nevertheless, these attacks require a quite precise
   fault injection like a bit flip or target a special operation without
   any possibility to check if the fault was injected in the intended way,
   like in safe-error attacks. In this paper we propose a new attack on
   square and multiply, based on a manipulation of the control flow.
   Furthermore, we show how to realize this attack in practice using
   non-invasive spike attacks and discuss impacts of different side channel
   analysis counter measures on our attack. The attack was performed using
   low cost equipment.}},

Abstract = {{DNS amplification attacks utilize IP address spoofing and large numbers
   of open recursive DNS servers to perform the bandwidth consumption
   attack. During an attack, it ceaselessly fabricates DNS queries to the
   exploited open recursive DNS servers, and all the responses, often with
   larger size than the query messages, are reflected to the single victim
   due to the source IP address spoofing. While it is difficult to defend
   against this attack from the root causes by eliminating the open
   recursive DNS servers and IP spoofing for the whole Internet, in this
   paper, we take a different methodology to defend against it at the leaf
   router of victim's ISP or organization. We propose an efficient and
   low-cost hardware approach to first detect the DNS amplification attack
   accurately and responsively. Once the attack is confirmed, our approach
   is then activated to filter out all the illegitimate DNS responses by
   using a two-Bloom filter solution. We demonstrate that the memory cost
   of our approach is feasible for the hardware implementation even up to
   the OC-768 link. Through trace-driven simulations, it is shown that our
   approach is effective in both the detecting and filtering phases.}},

Abstract = {{Localisation and tracking of nodes in wireless sensor networks is
   valuable in many applications, and is the primary purpose of the network
   in applications such as for monitoring emergency service personnel and
   athletes for performance monitoring. Performing high accuracy tracking
   using low-cost hardware in difficult radio propagation environments is
   extremely challenging, and the CSIRSO WASP system was designed to meet
   this challenge. In this paper results are presented of trials of the
   WASP system for monitoring cyclists that were conducted with the
   Australian Institute of Sport. The results show that the system has an
   absolute and relative error less than 0.33 in for 95\% of the

Abstract = {{In the current study, the most effective geometry for the design
   electrode and the advantage of the low cost equipment in electrochemical
   smoothing following end turning is investigated. Through simple
   equipment attachment, electrochemical smoothing can follow the cutting
   on the same machine. An adequate workpiece rotational speed associated
   with higher electrode rotation produces better polishing. The effective
   design electrode with a small wedge angle and a small edge rounding
   radius have an optimal value for higher current density and provides a
   larger discharge space, which produces a smoother surface. The electrode
   of the partial curve with a small line diameter performs the best for
   the electropolishing. Electrochemical smoothing saves the need for
   precise turning, making the total process time less than the
   electrobrightening. But the electrobrightening after precise turning
   only requires quite a short time to make the workpiece bright. The use
   of ultrasonics in the electrochemical smoothing and the
   electrobrightening is more evident than the pulsed current, since the
   ultrasonics -aided process exempts off time and obtains a better
   polishing result. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical system with backlash nonlinearity is distinguished
   between a ``backlash mode{''} and a ``contact mode{''}. The inherent
   switch between the two operating modes makes the system a prime example
   of hybrid system. In this paper, a PieceWise Affine (PWA) model of the
   mechanical system with backlash nonlinearity is built. A constrained
   time-optimal predictive control problem based on the hybrid PWA model is
   formulated for solving the optimal control problem of mechanical system
   with backlash nonlinearity. The proposed constrained time-optimal
   predictive control strategy consists of two parts, that is, control
   invariant set computation and constrained time-optimal control law
   computation. For the purpose of reducing computation of online
   implementation, the control law is precomputed offline for the range of
   model states and references by combining dynamic programming strategy
   with the reachability analysis for the PWA model. In the simulation of
   tracking the reference speed, it is demonstrated that the constrained
   time-optimal predictive control approach has better tracking control
   effect and less computation time compared with the constrained finite
   time optimal control approach. The resulting control law achieves that
   for any reference the tracking error remains within a small bounded set,
   furthermore, the online implementation becomes simpler by the offline
   computation in the former step, thereby reducing computation burden and
   being implemented on low-cost hardware for systems with small sampling
   time.}},

Abstract = {{The field of food industry is nowadays governed by sonic of the toughest
   regulations ever seen in industry in order to maintain the quality of
   practices such as product traceability and hygiene. Beside these it is
   required to maintain flexible processes in order to allow alternative

   therefore no Surprise that this field is very active in introducing
   automated systems to perform many tasks. The recent advances in
   semiconductor technology allow to design and implement advanced
   mathematical methods on low cost hardware platforms. It is a desiderate
   for smart sensor systems to implement mechanisms similar to the humans
   mental activity of combining information for the goal of recognizing a
   measurand that is hardly distinguishable with a single sensor. This
   presentation will introduce the concept of virtual sensor. A vision
   based contactless weighting sensor will be presented together with the
   mathematical foundations required for building and calibrating it. Its
   real-time performance is demonstrated through the implementation of an
   automatic sorting system. Further improvements and optimization
   techniques are introduced in order to make the system able to maximize
   yield of edible product, reduce labor requirements of the complete

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel image interpolation method, extended linear
   interpolation, which is a low-cost architecture with the interpolation
   quality compatible to that of bi-cubic convolution interpolation. The
   architecture of reducing the computational complexity of generating
   weighting coefficients is proposed. Based on the approach, the low-cost
   hardware architecture with digital image scaling is designed under the
   real-time requirement. Our proposed method provides a simple hardware
   architecture design, low computation cost and is easy to implement. The
   presented architecture is implemented on the Virtex-II FPGA, and the
   VLSI architecture has been successfully designed and implemented with
   TSMC 0.13 mu m standard cell library. The simulation results demonstrate
   that the high performance architecture of extended linear interpolation
   at 267MHz with 26200 gates in a 452x452 mu m(2) chip is able to process
   digital image scaling for HDTV in real-time.}},

Abstract = {{Super-resolution is a smart process capable of generating images with a
   higher resolution than the resolution of the sensor used to acquire the
   images. Due to this reason, it has acquired a significant relevance
   within the medical community during the last years, especially for those
   specialties closely related with the medical imaging field. However, the
   super-resolution algorithms used in this field are normally extremely
   complex and thus, they tend to be slow and difficult to be implemented
   in hardware. This paper proposes a new super-resolution algorithm for
   video sequences that, while maintaining excellent levels in the
   objective and subjective visual quality of the processed images,
   presents a reduced computational cost due to its non-iterative nature
   and the use of fast motion estimation techniques. Additionally, the
   algorithm has been successfully implemented in a low-cost hardware
   platform, which guarantees the viability of the proposed solution for
   real-time biomedical systems-on-chip.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose. The purpose of this article is to illustrate a case where
   acquisition of digital imaging know-how by a modern radiotherapy
   division has helped to solve a technical problem while allowing
   substantial savings through the use of free and open-source resources.
   The problem was related to the necessity to route, with complex
   policies, the images produced by different digital imaging and
   communications in medicine (DICOM) sources within the department or in
   other divisions and/or hospitals. Materials and methods. The problem was
   solved by using completely free, well-tested and stable technologies
   (PHP, Apache, MySQL. DCMTK OFFIS, Red Hat Linux 9A and Linux Fedora Core
   4) and low-cost hardware to contain costs. In the development. we also
   considered integration of the routed images with the existing electronic
   clinical records.
   Results. The system developed, called the dicom router, implemented two
   kinds of routing: manual and automatic, both oriented to link the images
   acquired with the existing electronic clinical records. System stability
   was enhanced in a second phase by using a low-cost hardware redundancy
   solution. The system has now been operating for I year and has proved
   the value of the technologies used.
   Conclusions. The need to operate with more than one provider creates a
   series of integration issues, so that it becomes economically appealing
   to acquire internally the knowledge needed to interact more precisely
   with providers of big information technology (IT) solutions. This need
   is well catered for by open-source technologies, which are well
   documented and available to everyone. By using them, in-house IT
   technicians are able to implement valuable technical solutions for
   small- to. medium-sized informatization problems, which would otherwise
   remain unsolved except with great economic efforts.}},

Abstract = {{The detection of the carcinogenic trihalomethanes (THM) in public water
   supply systems using low-cost equipment has become an essential feature,
   since these compounds may be generated as by-products of water-treatment
   processes. Here we report on a sensor array that extends the concept of
   an ``electronic tongue{''} to detect small amounts of bromoform,
   bromodichloromethane and dibromochloromethane, with detection limits as
   low as 0.02 mg L-1. The sensor array was made up of 10 sensing units, in
   which nanostructured films of conducting and natural polymers were
   deposited onto gold interdigitated electrodes. The principle of
   detection was impedance spectroscopy, with measurements carried out in
   the range between 1 Hz to 1 MHz. Using data at 1 kHz, at which the
   electrical response varied considerably by changing the analyte, we
   demonstrated with principal component analysis (PCA) that samples with
   the 3 brominated trihalomethanes can be distinguished from each other
   and for various concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{A team of small, low-cost robots instead of a single large, complex
   robot is useful in operations such as search and rescue, urban
   exploration etc. However, performance of such a team is limited due to
   restricted mobility of the team members. We propose solutions based on
   physical cooperation among mobile robots to improve the overall
   mobility. Our focus is on the development of the low level system
   components. Recognizing that small robots need to overcome discrete
   obstacles, we develop specific analytical maneuvers to negotiate each
   obstacle where a maneuver is built from a sequence of fundamental
   cooperative behaviors. In this paper we present cooperative behaviors
   that are achieved by interactions among robots via un-actuated links
   thus avoiding the need for additional actuation.
   We analyze the cooperative lift behavior and demonstrate that useful
   maneuvers such a gap crossing can be built using this behavior. We prove
   that the requirements on ground friction and wheel torques set
   fundamental limits for physical cooperation. Using the design guidelines
   based on static analysis we have developed simple and low cost hardware
   to illustrate cooperative gap crossing with two robots. We have
   developed a complete dynamic model of two-robot cooperation which leads
   to control design. A novel connecting link design is proposed that can
   change the system configuration with no additional actuators. A
   decentralized control architecture is designed for the two-robot system,
   where each robot controls its own state with no information about the
   state of the other robot thus avoiding the need of continuous
   communication between the two robots. Simulation and hardware results
   demonstrate a successful implementation with the gap crossing example.
   We have analytically proved that robot dynamics can be used to reduce
   the friction requirements and have demonstrated, with simulations, the
   implementation of this idea for the cooperative lifting behavior.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a genetic-algori thin-(GA-) based method has been
   developed to determine the instantaneous pressure in cylinders of
   internal combustion engines. Some parameters associated with a pressure
   curve in each cylinder are optimized from two validated submodels which
   reproduce the engine behavior using a genetic algorithm. In this
   process, the profile of both measured and modeled instantaneous angular
   speeds of the engine are compared. According to a typical design of a
   genetic algorithm, different operators, such as the selection process,
   crossover, and mutation, have been evaluated and applied over
   theoretical data. The best results define the adopted GA structure, and
   it is applied to three different engines: single-cylinder diesel
   engine(DE), three-cylinder spark ignition engine, and a 16-cylinder vee
   power plant diesel engine. This algorithm makes it possible to estimate
   a good quality pressure profile in cylinders for any kind of engine
   (operation basis and the number and disposition of cylinders), using
   indirect measurements and low-cost equipment.}},

Abstract = {{Radiotherapy research lacks a flexible computational research
   environment for Monte Carlo (MC) and patient-specific treatment
   planning. The purpose of this study was to develop a flexible software
   package on low-cost hardware with the aim of integrating new
   patient-specific treatment planning with MC dose calculations suitable
   for large-scale prospective and retrospective treatment planning
   studies. We designed the software package `McGill Monte Carlo treatment
   planning' (MMCTP) for the research development of MC and
   patient-specific treatment planning. The MMCTP design consists of a
   graphical user interface (GUI), which runs on a simple workstation
   connected through standard secure-shell protocol to a cluster for
   lengthy MC calculations. Treatment planning information (e. g., images,
   structures, beam geometry properties and dose distributions) is
   converted into a convenient MMCTP local file storage format designated,
   the McGill RT format. MMCTP features include (a) DICOM\_RT, RTOG and
   CADPlan CART format imports; (b) 2D and 3D visualization views for
   images, structure contours, and dose distributions; (c) contouring
   tools; (d) DVH analysis, and dose matrix comparison tools; (e) external
   beam editing; (f) MC transport calculation from beam source to patient
   geometry for photon and electron beams. The MC input files, which are
   prepared from the beam geometry properties and patient information ( e.
   g., images and structure contours), are uploaded and run on a cluster
   using shell commands controlled from the MMCTP GUI. The visualization,
   dose matrix operation and DVH tools offer extensive options for plan
   analysis and comparison between MC plans and plans imported from
   commercial treatment planning systems. The MMCTP GUI provides a flexible
   research platform for the development of patient-specific MC treatment
   planning for photon and electron external beam radiation therapy. The
   impact of this tool lies in the fact that it allows for systematic,
   platform-independent, large-scale MC treatment planning for different
   treatment sites. Patient recalculations were performed to validate the
   software and ensure proper functionality.}},

Abstract = {{Advantages of communications satellites are the inherent broadcast
   capability, high bandwidth, reliability and flexibility in network
   expansion. Small transportable terminals can be made operational very
   quickly. Recent developments in communications and computer technology
   allow to provide low-cost equipment, which is affordable even in
   developing countries. Communications satellites can also play an
   important role in case of emergencies or natural disasters. The
   combination of satellite communications and navigation can support new
   services for emergency teams.
   At the Institute of Applied Systems Technology and the Institute of
   Communication Networks and Satellite Communications highly transportable
   terminals have been developed, both for star and mesh network
   topologies. A fully meshed VSAT system is used for symmetrical links.
   For other applications, which do not require high return link capacity
   an asymmetrical system is an efficient solution. It uses low-cost DVB
   technology for the forward link and satellite phones with data
   capability on the return link. Novel multicast protocols allow to use
   these asymmetrical links in an efficient way. The paper describes the
   different systems and their applications in disaster management and
   security applications. Emphasis is put on transfer of remote sensing
   images and voice over IP (VoIP) as well as videoconference services. (c)

Abstract = {{Water channels (aquaporins) family members have been identified in

   hand-made adapter to a microscope and the use of free software to
   measure membrane water permeability in Xenopus oocytes. One of the main
   purposes of this setup is to maintain a high level of quality in images

Abstract = {{The availability of low-cost hardware such as CMOS cameras and
   microphones has fostered the development of Wireless Multimedia Sensor
   Networks (WMSNs), i.e., networks of wirelessly interconnected devices
   that are able to ubiquitously retrieve multimedia content such as video
   and audio streams, still images, and scalar sensor data from the
   environment. In this paper, the state of the art in algorithms,
   protocols, and hardware for wireless multimedia sensor networks is
   surveyed, and open research issues are discussed in detail.
   Architectures for WMSNs are explored, along with their advantages and
   drawbacks. Currently off-the-shelf hardware as well as available
   research prototypes for WMSNs are listed and classified. Existing
   solutions and open research issues at the application, transport,
   network, link, and physical layers of the communication protocol stack
   are investigated, along with possible cross-layer synergies and
   optimizations. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, novel hardware sharing architectures are proposed for
   realizations of fast 4 x 4 and 8 x 8 forward/inverse integer transforms
   in H.264/AVC applications. Based on matrix factorizations, the
   cost-effective architectures for fast one-dimensional (I-D) 4 x 4 and 8
   x 8 forward/inverse integer transforms can be derived through the
   Kronecker and direct sum operations. By applying the concept of hardware
   sharing, the proposed hardware schemes for fast integer transforms need
   a smaller number of shifters and adders than the direct realization
   architecture, where the direct architecture just implements the
   individual 4 x 4 and individual 8 x 8 integer transforms independently.
   With low hardware cost and regular modularity, the proposed hardware
   sharing architectures can process up to 125 MHz with the cost-effective
   area and are suitable for VLSI implementations to accomplish the
   H.264/AVC signal processing.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic algorithms are a class of stochastic optimization techniques
   inspired by biological evolution processes. The power of GAs for solving
   complex problems is highly used in the design of parallel problem
   solving machines. High parallelism needs higher number of parallel
   processors to be used simultaneously. This approach may be costly in
   terms of efficiency and utilization of processors. GAs are time costly
   processes mainly because of their time consuming evaluation operations.
   Development of a low cost hardware evaluation unit may help reducing
   time complexities of GAs. In this paper an attempt is made to show how
   the fitness evaluation operation of any genetically encoded problem can
   be performed by using a simple hardware. Our hardware uses a postfix
   notation of the fitness expression. Since, in GAs, the same function is
   evaluated for a fairly large number of times, we need to compile a
   postfix expression only once at the beginning of the genetic
   optimization process. We performed some simulation experiments on
   function optimization problems, in general. As an example of
   combinatorial optimization, we considered the fizzy clustering problem.}},

   helps to minimaze the expenses. This paper presents studies and
   development of a low cost electrical energy monitoring system, that
   consists of a digital energy meter, a software for the system
   management, a database to store the measurements and a WebPage to
   monitor the energy quality from anywhere, through the internet.
   Algorithms of calculus are proposed for implementation. Physical

Abstract = {{One of the main disadvantages of monitoring systems based on Smart Web
   Sensors is the difficulty to have a complete access to all data. In
   fact, nearly everyone of the actual available systems use proprietary
   embedded software to perform measurements, because only the manufacturer
   knows the internal hardware architecture and as servers exchange
   information. Moreover, those systems are not able to share information
   in a free way, because of using different implementations and protocols.
   The main goal of this paper is to present an implementation of a
   distributed measurement system, based on the web service approach. The
   proposed system is based on a freeware widely utilized technology, the
   Gnutella network, to route and share information adopting a low-cost
   hardware architecture. Gnutella, like most other peer-to-peer (P2P)
   applications, builds a virtual network with its own routing mechanisms
   at the application level. The implemented topology of this overlay
   network and the routing mechanisms have a significant influence on the
   application properties such as performance, reliability and scalability.
   The Gnutella architecture gives the possibility to create a monitoring
   network in which the clients are all connected without any user
   operation. In this paper, the authors describe the implemented
   Gnutella-based distributed measurement system and the architecture of
   the implemented prototype of low-cost smart web sensor.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we explore the impact of faulty sensor nodes on quality of
   surveillance. The faulty behavior of sensor nodes may result from
   several situations, such as malfunctions due to low-cost hardware,
   environmental interference, or battery depletion. Two major fault models
   of sensor nodes including false alarm and detection miss are addressed.
   To enhance the quality of surveillance, a data aggregation scheme is
   employed to increase the credibility of the sensing reports. Because the
   energy resource on sensor nodes is scarce, how to determine the degree
   of data aggregation to achieve the desirable quality, while the overall
   system lifetime can be prolonged, is an important issue. We define the
   quality of surveillance considering the system false alarm and the
   system detection miss to provide a deployment strategy for surveillance.
   Furthermore, the improvement of the data aggregation scheme and the
   related metrics on quality of surveillance are analyzed through
   simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Silicon dioxide (SiO2) film is an important material for semiconductor
   industry as the gate dielectric material, and optical industry as
   antireflective coatings, and so on. The sol-gel method has been widely
   used for the deposition of oxide thin films due to several advantages
   such as simple and low-cost equipment, normal atmospheric conditions,
   and ease control of the precursor composition doping. In this work, SiO2
   thin film was deposited on BK7 glass substrate by spin-coating and
   dip-coating techniques, respectively. Three precursor concentrations
   were investigated, i.e., tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS): ethanol: water=
   1:7:7, 1:10:10 and 1:15:15 (molar ratio). X-Ray Diffraction spectrometry
   (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and UV-VIS-NIR scanning
   spectrophotometry were used to characterize the crystallinity,
   morphological and optical properties of deposited SiO2 thin films.
   Results show that all the SiO2 thin films deposited by the spin-coating
   and dip-coating are amorphous. SEM analysis confirms that the deposited
   SiO2 thin films have high surface quality and tight adherence with the
   substrate. The transmittance measurements indicate that dip-coated SiO2
   thin film from gel of low precursor concentration represents better
   transmittance than that from high concentrations at the range of
   600-1200nm. SiO2 thin film spin-coated from gel of high precursor
   concentration has better transmittance than that by dip-coating, but of
   opposite results for the films deposited from gels of low precursor
   concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{A technique based on multisyringe chromatography (MSC) was developed to
   determine three beta-lactamic antibiotics. Amoxicillin (AMOXI),
   ampicillin (AMPI) and cephalexin (CEPHA) were analyzed using a system
   with a very simple design and very low-cost equipment consisting of a
   multisyringe module, three low-pressure solenoid valves, a monolithic
   Chromolith Flash RP-18e column and a diode array spectrophotometric
   detector monitoring at 250 nm. Mobile phases containing methanol:acetic
   acid (0.1 M)-sodium acetate (0.1 M), pH 6.2, were tested for various
   ratios of methanol:acetic acid-sodium acetate, but a ratio of 10:90 gave
   optimum results with a flow rate of 2 ml min(-1). Validation parameters
   were evaluated for amoxicillin. The response to amoxicillin was linear
   over the range 0.04-0.4 mg/mL, with a correlation coefficient of 0.9996;
   precisions, evaluated as the repeatability for 0.04, 0.16 and 0.4 mg/mL
   amoxicillin, were 0.6\%, 0.1\% and 0.6\%, respectively. Recovery from a
   generic formulation of amoxicillin was evaluated. The method showed
   selectivity in the presence of excipients commonly used in capsules, and
   satisfactory specificity was observed for amoxicillin and hydrolytic
   degradation products. The linearity was also evaluated for cephalexin
   and ampicillin. The conditions selected for MSC separation were compared
   with those for a HPLC system, and similar results were obtained in terms
   of chromatographic parameters but a difference in retention times was
   observed.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a complete design of a high speed optical motion analyzer
   system has been described. The main core of the image processing unit
   has been implemented by the differential algorithm procedure. Some
   intelligent and conservative procedures that facilitate the search
   algorithm have also been proposed and implemented for the processing of
   human motions. Moreover, an optimized modified direct linear
   transformation (MDLT) method has been used to reconstruct 31) markers
   positions which are used for deriving kinematic characteristics of the
   motion. Consequently, a set of complete tests using some simple
   mechanical devices were conducted to verify the system outputs.
   Considering the system verification for human motion analysis, we used
   the system for gait analysis and the results including joint angles
   showed good compatibility with other investigations. Furthermore, a
   sport application example of the system has been quantitatively
   presented and discussed for Iranian National Karate-kas. The low
   computational cost, the high precision in detecting and reconstructing
   marker position with 2.39 mm error, and the capability of capturing from
   any number of cameras to increase the domain of operation of the
   subject, has made the proposed method a reliable approach for real-time

Abstract = {{A sequential injection system for the determination of nitrate (NO3-) in
   vegetables was developed to automate this determination, allowing for
   substantially reduced reagent consumption and generated waste using
   low-cost equipment. After extraction with water and filtration, the
   extracted nitrate is reduced inline to nitrite in a copperized cadmium
   (Cd) column and determined as nitrite, According to the Griess-Ilosvay
   reaction, nitrate is diazotized with sulfanilamide and coupled with
   N-(I-naphtyl)-ethylenediamine dihydrochloride to form a purple-red azo
   dye monitored at 538 nm.
   Nitrate can be determined within a range of 1.35-50.0 mg L-1 of NO3-
   (corresponding to 0.270-10.0 g of NO3- per kg of vegetable), with a
   conversion rate of nitrate to nitrite of 99.1 +/- 0.8\%. The results
   obtained for 15 vegetable extracts compare well with those provided by
   the classical procedure, with a sampling throughput of 24 determinations
   per hour and relative standard deviations better than 1.2\%.}},

Abstract = {{The open source software movement has been going on for a few decades
   now. Today, an increasing number of open source solutions enter the
   market and become valid alternatives to proprietary and closed
   solutions. Examples include operating systems like Linux and
   OpenSolaris, back-end solutions (e.g. LAMP - Linux, Apache web server,
   MySQL database, and Perl/PHP/Python programming languages - are among
   the most well-known and widely used open source software on the
   Internet), office applications (e.g. Firefox web browser, Thunderbird
   email, GIMP graphics, OpenOffice office suite), and complete enterprise
   systems like Compiere (ERP and CRM) and Mambo content management system
   (CMS). In addition, a variety of devices increasingly include open
   source (e.g. cellular phones, network equipment like routers, and
   Asterisk - a complete IP PBX).
   The open source culture is about much more than software and includes
   open source hardware, views on intellectual properties rights,
   completely changes how products are developed and owned, and how
   business models are developed.
   To decide if open source is something for you, a good understanding of
   what open source really means is necessary. This includes legal aspects
   (different licenses), availability of support with (hopefully a
   thriving) user community and commercial for-pay support options, and
   security.
   Intellectual properties rights, and the vast number of many types of
   open source licenses (e.g. GNU General Public License (GPL) and BSD
   License), is one of the more complex areas when using open source. What
   can and not can be done, what must be done, and so on, vary between
   licenses. One effort to bring some order in all this is the Open Source
   Definition (OSD) from Open Source Initiative (OSI) which lists ten
   conditions that must be met for an OSI Certified open source license.
   Today, many companies have already been forced to either remove or
   release as open source code borrowed by developers without properly
   complying with licenses. Such ``dirty code{''} is increasingly easy to
   detect via compliance tools used by companies doing this as business.
   (Not to mention whistle-blowing employees tipping of property owners.)
   Searching for dirty code is also increasingly part of due diligence in
   mergers and acquisitions and can add costly delays and lawsuits.
   The perceived low cost is often a reason for considering open source
   solutions but the total costs of development (TCD) including for example
   licenses, tools, labor, and support - must be considered from initial
   design, to maintenance, all through the end of life of the product.
   This paper reviews critical aspects for going open source, including
   software and hardware, use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)
   alternatives, system design going from a monolithic, single-binary,
   firmware to a layered design with operating system, middleware, and user
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Two common approaches have been developed to compress volumetric medical
   data from sources such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed
   tomography (CT): (1) 2D-based compression methods, which compress each
   image slice independently using 2D image codecs; and (2) 3D-based
   compression methods, which treat the data as true volumetric data and
   compress using 3D image codecs. It has been shown that most 3D-based
   compression methods, such as 3D-SPIHT, can achieve significantly higher
   compression quality than most 2D-based compression methods, such as
   JPEG, JPEG-2000, and 2D-SPIHT. However, the compression/decompression
   speed is slow, and the high computational complexity and high memory
   usage render 3D-based compressions difficult to implement in hardware.
   In this paper, we propose a new 313-based compression algorithm,
   3D-BCWT, which is an extension to the computationally efficient BCWT
   (Backward Coding of Wavelet Trees) algorithm {[}10]. 3D-BCWT not only
   can achieve the same high compression quality as 3D-SPIHT does, but it
   can also provide extremely fast compression/decompression speed, low
   complexity, and low memory usage, which are ideal for low-cost hardware
   and software implementations and for compressing high resolution
   volumetric data. Moreover, 3D-BCWT also possesses the capabilities of
   progressive transmission and decoding, such as progression of resolution
   and progression of quality, which are essential features for efficient
   image retrieval from large online archives.}},

Abstract = {{Technology scaling, characterized by decreasing feature size, thinning
   gate oxide, and non-ideal voltage scaling, will become a major hindrance
   to microprocessor reliability in future technology generations. Physical
   analysis of device failure mechanisms has shown that most wearout
   mechanisms projected to plague future technology generations are
   progressive, meaning that the circuit-level effects of wearout develop
   and intensify with age over the lifetime of the chip. This work
   leverages the progression of wearout over time in order to present a
   low-cost hardware structure that identifies increasing propagation
   delay, which is symptomatic of many forms of wearout, to accurately
   forecast the failure of microarchitectural structures. To motivate the
   use of this predictive technique, an HSPICE analysis of the effects of
   one particular failure mechanism, gate oxide breakdown, on gates from a
   standard cell library characterized for a 90 nm process is presented.
   This gate-level analysis is then used to demonstrate the aggregate
   change in output delay of high-level structures within a synthesized
   Verilog model of an embedded microprocessor core. Leveraging this
   analysis, a self-calibrating hardware structure for conducting
   statistical analysis of output delay is presented and its efficacy in
   predicting the failure of a variety of structures within the
   microprocessor core is evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{During the roughly year-long Seismic Wave Exploration in the Lower
   Lithosphere (SWELL) pilot experiment in 1997/1998, eight ocean bottom
   instruments deployed to the southwest of the Hawaiian Islands recorded
   teleseismic Rayleigh waves with periods between 15 and 70 s. Such data
   are capable of resolving structural variations in the oceanic
   lithosphere and upper asthenosphere and therefore help understand the
   mechanism that supports the Hawaiian Swell relief. The pilot experiment
   was a technical as well as a scientific feasibility study and consisted
   of a hexagonal array of Scripps Low-Cost Hardware for Earth Applications
   and Physical Oceanography (L-CHEAPO) instruments using differential
   pressure sensors. The analysis of eighty-four earthquakes provided
   numerous high-precision phase velocity curves over an unprecedentedly
   wide period range. We find a rather uniform (unaltered) lid at the top
   of the lithosphere that is underlain by a strongly heterogeneous lower
   lithosphere and upper asthenosphere. Strong slow anomalies appear within
   similar to 300 km of the island chain and indicate that the lithosphere
   has most likely been altered by the same process that causes the
   Hawaiian volcanism. The anomalies increase with depth and reach well
   into the asthenosphere, suggesting a sublithospheric dynamic source for
   the swell relief. The imaged velocity variations are consistent with
   thermal rejuvenation, but our array does not appear to have covered the
   melt-generating region of the Hawaiian hotspot.}},

Abstract = {{The nature of the computation based on membranes, distributed,
   nondeterministic and massively parallel makes that the current hardware
   architectures, mainly based in the use of clusters of microprocessors,
   be not the most appropriate to house this type of systems; especially if
   we think about the associated costs to solutions that try to maximize
   the grade of potential parallelism. The use of microcontroller in these
   cases, it could be considered like a viable alternative, by its low cost
   and its high processing capacity, of not being because its use is
   restricted to problems that can be adapted to the small amount of memory
   that this kind of devices has to store generic data.
   The present work describes in a exhaustive way the implementation of a
   low cost hardware prototype based on microcontrollers that making use of
   external memory modules is able to resolve the main problem of the small
   capacity of storage of these components. This way range of approachable
   problems is enlarged and its use becomes a real alternative to the
   solutions based on clusters of microprocessors.
   The adopted hardware architecture also endows from a great flexibility
   to the proposed solution, since, unlike others, it doesn't require
   modifications to adapt to anyone of the topologies of current membrane
   systems. It will be responsibility of the software component that we
   use, the implementation of the algorithms that reproduce the behavior of
   different membrane systems.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a home-computer based system, addressing important
   aspects of the development of contemporary home - care that comprises of
   first, the employment of low-cost commercially available components,
   supporting home-care patient's well-being observation, including
   eventually vital-signs monitoring, and, second, software means for the
   processing, the evaluation and the targeted transmission of the acquired
   health-data, together with the home-care patient administration,. The
   hardware of the system comprises of, first, a custom-made ECG
   acquisition module, equipped with a RF link between amplifier and PC,
   second, a Nellcor finger pulse oximetry probe for typical
   plethysmography based Oxygen Saturation (SpO2) measurements and the
   estimation of Heart Rate (HR) and Respiration Rate (RR), and third,
   another custom-made Carotid Sounds (CS) acquisition module, for the
   extraction of Heart Rate (HR) and Respiration Rate (RR). The acquired
   row data and trends of SpO2, FIR, RR, ECG waveforms, Oxygen Therapy
   advice etc. are appropriately processed to produce decision supportive
   data, while they can be easily stored in the home computer and / or
   transmitted to another location. The transmission can he achieved
   through wireless point-to-point links, modem and telephone lines on
   both, landlines and mobile cellular telephone lines, by a designated
   location through secured paths over the internet and, finally, through
   two satellite communication links. The pulse oximetry module is employed
   only if the patient is in need of Oxygen Therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Chromatic dispersion (CD) in single-mode optical fibres limits the
   maximum transmission distance of digital optical transmission systems at
   10 and 40 Gb/s. It can be eliminated by a tunable CD compensator,
   provided that the residual dispersion is detected, including its sign. A
   low-cost hardware implementation of a signed online CD detection scheme
   is reported. It is based on synchronous detection of frequency
   modulation (FM)-induced arrival time modulations in the clock recovery
   phase locked loop (PLL) of a 2 x 10 Gb/s return-to-zero differential
   quadrature phase shift keying (RZ-DQPSK) optical receiver. The RZ-DQPSK
   transmitter laser is modulated by a synthesised 4.732 MHz sinusoidal
   signal. This results in similar or equal to 1\% (rms) intensity
   modulation and an optical FM with similar or equal to 105 MHz (rms)
   deviation. Low-cost components were used to build a synchronous detector
   for the arrival time signal that yields the fibre CD, including its
   sign. The total measurement interval is similar or equal to 84 mu s. The
   sign of the CD is detected within a range of +/- 700 ps/nm. This range
   is limited by the locking range of the clock recovery PLL. The CD
   measurement readout is fairly linear over the range +/- 360 ps/nm.}},

Abstract = {{In response to the current need for fast, secure and cheap public-key
   cryptography, we propose an interactive zero-knowledge identification
   scheme and a derived signature scheme that combine provable security
   based on the problem of computing discrete logarithms in any group,
   short keys, very short transmission and minimal on-line computation.
   This leads to both efficient and secure applications well suited to
   implementation on low cost smart cards.
   We introduce GPS, a Schnorr-like scheme that does not require knowledge
   of the order of the group nor of the group element. As a consequence, it
   can be used with most cryptographic group structures, including those of
   unknown order. Furthermore, the computation of the prover's response is
   done over the integers, hence can be done with very limited
   computational capabilities. This paper provides complete security proofs
   of the identification scheme. From a practical point of view, the
   possible range of parameters is discussed and a report on the
   performances of an actual implementation on a cheap smart card is
   included: a complete and secure authentication can be performed in less
   than 20 milliseconds with low cost equipment.}},

Abstract = {{The objectives of this paper on the Reseau Afrique Francophone de
   Telemedecine (RAFT) project are the evaluation of feasibility,
   potential, problems and risks of an Internet-based tele-medicine network
   in developing countries of Africa. The RAFT project was started in
   Western African countries 5 years ago and has now extended to other
   regions of Africa as well (i.e. Madagascar, Rwanda). A project for the
   development of a national tele-medicine network in Mali was initiated in
   2001, extended to Mauritania in 2002 and to Morocco in 2003. By 2006, a
   total of nine countries are connected. The entire technical
   infrastructure is based on Internet technologies for medical distance
   learning and tele-consultations.
   The results are a tele-medicine network that has been in productive use
   for over 5 years and has enabled various collaboration channels,
   including North-to-South (from Europe to Africa), South-to-South (within
   Africa), and South-to-North (from Africa to Europe) distance learning
   and tele-consultations, plus many personal exchanges between the
   participating hospitals and Universities. It has also unveiled a set of
   potential problems: (a) the limited importance of North-to-South
   collaborations when there are major differences in the available
   resources or the socio-cultural contexts between the collaborating
   parties; (b) the risk of an induced digital divide if the periphery of
   the health system in developing countries is not involved in the
   development of the network; and (c) the need for the development of
   local medical content management skills. Particularly point (c) is
   improved through the collaboration between the various countries as
   professionals from the medical and the computer science field are
   sharing courses and resources. Personal exchanges between partners in
   the project are frequent, and several persons received an education at
   one of the partner Universities.
   As conclusion, we can say that the identified risks have to be taken
   into account when designing large-scale tele-medicine projects in
   developing countries. These problems can be mitigated by fostering
   South-South collaboration channels, by the use of satellite-based
   Internet connectivity in remote areas, the appreciation of local
   knowledge and its publication on-line. The availability of such an
   infrastructure also facilitates the development of other projects,
   courses, and local content creation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In practice, the environments in which mobile robots operate are usually
   modeled in highly complex forms and, as a result, autonomous navigation
   and localization can be difficult. The difficulties are exacerbated for
   practical robots with limited on-board computational resources and
   complex planning algorithms, since this paradigm of environmental
   modeling requires enormous computational power. A novel
   navigation/localization learning methodology is presented to abstract
   and transfer the human sequential navigational skill to a robotic
   wheelchair by showing the platform how to respond in different local
   environments along a demonstrated, static cluttered route using a lookup
   table representation. This method utilizes limited on-board range
   sensing information to concisely model local unstructured environments,
   with respect to the robot, for navigation or localization along the
   learned route in order to achieve good performance with low on-line
   computational demand and low-cost hardware requirements. Experimental
   study demonstrates the feasibility of this method and some interesting
   characteristics of navigation, localization, and environmental modeling
   problems. Analysis is also conducted to investigate performance
   evaluation, advantages of the approach, choices of lookup table inputs
   and outputs, and potential generalization of this paper.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method for the condition monitoring of the milling
   cutting process based upon a combination of two techniques; sweeping
   filters and tooth rotation energy estimation (TREE). Existing spindle
   speed and spindle load signals from the machine are used thus avoiding
   the need for any additional sensors. The sweeping filter technique
   determines the frequency components of the spindle signal using low cost
   hardware. The filter's cut off frequency is swept across a range of
   frequencies and its output is acquired and analysed in real time. The
   variations of individual tooth energies estimated by the TREE technique
   in the time domain are used to verify the results. The hybrid approach
   created is based on the verification of any indicated faults before
   making a final conclusion about the health of the cutting tool. This
   provides a robust and reliable tool monitoring system that is able to
   identify tool breakage in real time during machining operations. (c)

Abstract = {{Eye tracking has long held the promise of being a useful methodology for
   human computer interaction. However, a number of barriers have stood in
   the way of the integration of eye tracking into everyday applications,
   including the intrusiveness, robustness, availability and price of
   eye-tracking systems. To lower these barriers, we have developed the
   openEyes system. The system consists of an open-hardware design for a
   digital eye tracker that can be built from low-cost off-the-shelf
   components, and a set of open-source software tools for digital image
   capture, manipulation, and analysis in eye-tracking applications. We
   expect that the availability of this system will facilitate the
   development of eye-tracking applications and the eventual integration of
   eye tracking into the next generation of everyday human computer
   interfaces. We discuss the methods and technical challenges of low-cost
   eye tracking as well as the design decisions that produced our current

Abstract = {{The localization problem for an autonomous robot moving in a known
   environment is a well-studied problem which has seen many elegant
   solutions. Robot localization in a dynamic environment populated by
   several moving obstacles, however, is still a challenge for research. In
   this paper, we use an omnidirectional camera mounted on a mobile robot
   to perform a sort of scan matching. The omnidirectional vision system
   finds the distances of the closest color transitions in the environment,
   mimicking the way laser rangefinders detect the closest obstacles. The
   similarity of our sensor with classical rangefinders allows the use of
   practically unmodified Monte Carlo algorithms, with the additional
   advantage of being able to easily detect occlusions caused by moving
   obstacles. The proposed system was initially implemented in the RoboCup
   Middle-Size domain, but the experiments we present in this paper prove
   it to be valid in a general indoor environment with natural color
   transitions. We present localization experiments both in the RoboCup
   environment and in an unmodified office environment. In addition, we
   assessed the robustness of the system to sensor occlusions caused by
   other moving robots. The localization system runs in real-time on
   low-cost hardware.}},

Abstract = {{Industrialised nations have dedicated significant investments toward the
   development of civil infrastructure. To preserve this investment,
   attention must be given to proper maintenance. Structural Health
   Monitoring (SHM) has emerged as a tool to support this task. Networks of
   smart sensors, built upon wireless communication, have the potential to
   significantly improve SHM. Numerous platforms for smart sensors have
   been developed, most of which utilise proprietary hardware/software. The
   Berkeley Mote, utilised in this study, was the first open
   hardware/software platform to be developed. However, the Berkeley Mote
   was designed for generic applications and therefore the available
   sensors are not optimised for use in civil infrastructure applications.
   Acceleration and strain are among the most important physical quantities
   to judge the health of a structure. Although commercially available
   sensor boards have accelerometers, their applicability towards civil
   infrastructure is limited. This paper presents the development of new
   acceleration and strain sensor boards based on the Berkely-Mote platform
   and provides experimental verification of their performance within civil

Abstract = {{As part of ITS technology, to achieve quick map updates, we propose a
   method for automatically detecting changes in streetscapes from images
   captured by car-mounted omnidirectional cameras. It comprises two
   stages; accurate alignment of a map and street images taken at various
   times, and detection of changes in streetscapes from the aligned data.
   The system will collect data via many free-running cars fitted with
   low-cost equipment to obtain images at various times and along routes.
   In the first stage, we process the alignment of the image frames taken
   at same locations and determine the accurate position information of
   each frame by a method composed of dimension reduction and DP matching.
   Then in the second stage, we detect changes in streetscapes from images
   taken at various times. Experiments with 44 data items which were
   collected over about a year, demonstrate the effectiveness of our
   method.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the Pulse Interval Modulation scheme for wireless

   (PIM) scheme is a modified version of the Pulse Position Modulation

   implementation. This paper tries to introduce one of the methods how to
   realize the PIM modulation by the use of microcontroller. At first, this
   technique can effectively improve the synchronization puzzles confronted
   during the process of modulation and demodulation. The second, the
   method can improve the coding efficiency of the laser communication
   system. The third, it could be integrated into one system by using PIC
   controlling mode. For the laser communicating system transmits data with
   computers via asynchronous series ports so that the demodulator can be
   made simple and cheap. At the end, the paper concludes the advantages
   for this implementation such as easier circuit design, more stable
   working reliability etc.}},

   compression method, which usually uses only 8 to 32 entries (32 bits
   each entry) of table, a simple counter and low cost hardware instead of
   0.5k to 4k entries of dictionary and window used by LZW-based
   compression methods. This new version adds a preprocessing and its
   corresponding post-procession steps such that the needed tracing
   memories can be further greatly decreased by shifting the on-line work
   loading to the preprocessing and post-processing. Comparing with other
   work on cost and compression ratio for several benchmarks, the average
   results of our system are also better than others.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present a new 3-moduli set (2(n)-1, 2(n)+l, 2(2n+1))
   and its RNS reverse converter design. The proposed 3-moduli set supports
   1) larger dynamic range and 2) shorter internal computing delay,
   comparing to the most popular modular set (2(n)-1, 2(n)+1, 2). Besides,
   to speed up residue to binary conversion, a low-cost hardware circuit is
   designed by only using two carry-save adders and one end around carry
   CLA (EACLA). Under the same dynamic range requirement, our proposed
   converter design is significantly more efficient than the latest design
   for modular set (2(n)-1, 2(n)+1, 2) with respect to hardware cost and
   Area-Time product (AT). Based on UMC 0.18um CMOS cell-based technology,
   the core area for 16-bit RNS reverse converter is only 1836um(2) and the
   worldrig frequency is 388MHz.}},

Abstract = {{A parallel signal generation scheme for OFDM signals is presented.
   Conventionally, the generation of OFDM signals is implemented by
   computing an Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (EDFT). If the bandwidth
   is very large, as in Ultra-wide Band (UWB) systems, preferably
   integrated solutions are used to generate the communication signals.
   Additionally, the output of the IDFT is protected against multipath
   propagation effects with either a cyclic extension or zero-padding.
   The system described in this paper enables the implementation of a UWB
   OFDM signal on low complexity and low cost hardware by generating
   subband OFDM signals. We show that additional errors are introduced on
   the subband edges, however. A performance study in terms of Symbol Error
   Rate (SER) has been conducted. The results show that similar SER
   performance is achieved when either using a highly integrated solution
   or our parallel signal generation approach.}},

   defuzzification methods are introduced which are suitable for low cost

   methods from different hardware implementation aspects. Two different
   hardware models with different structures are developed for each method.
   The first model realizes the full combinational or fastest possible
   hardware implementation, and the second model demonstrates the full
   sequential or the smallest possible hardware implementation of each
   method. All models are synthesized on 0.18 micron CMOS technology cells
   to analyze and compare the area, delay and power consumption of
   different realizations of defuzzification methods. Some
   area-power-delay- accuracy analysis diagrams are then introduced
   according to the synthesis results to guide the designers through
   choosing the defuzzification method and also the implementation
   structure which best suites their application from implementation cost,
   speed, power consumption and output accuracy points of view.}},

Abstract = {{The buoy (a kind of aids to navigation mark) is an important composing
   part of the transportation safe guarantee system at sea. For the safety
   of sail, it is very important that the sea buoys are insured accurate

   effectively. In this paper, a buoy monitoring system based on GPS and
   modern wireless communication technique is showed. There are two key
   problems: one is the accurate positioning, the other is how to judge
   whether the buoy is bumped or not. The GPS is used to solve these
   problems. We analyze the principle and deduce homologous arithmetic
   according to the data measured in fact and the equipment norm of sail
   mark. For the purpose of improving the positioning accuracy, firstly
   some simple ways that can be used in low cost equipment are introduced;
   the DGPS technology is also used. The GPRS wireless communication is
   used to transfer the difference correct parameters. Applying in practice
   show that the monitoring system can satisfy for the need of the

Abstract = {{Several applications require for a distributed measurement system able
   to measure the same or different parameters at different points in a
   wide area. Distributed systems based on smart web sensors represent the
   best solution to many different measurement problems. One of the main
   disadvantages of monitoring systems based on Smart Web Sensors is the
   difficulty to have a complete access to all data because they present a
   closed approach to interact with them, while Web Services are adopted in
   order to give a standard approach in developing a Service Oriented
   Architecture{[}1]. The main goal of this paper is to present an
   implementation of a environmental sensor for distributed measurement
   system based on the Web Service approach, adopting a freeware widely

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor networks have traditionally focused on low duty-cycle
   applications where sensor data are reported periodically in the order of
   seconds or even longer This is due to typically slow changes in physical
   variables, the need to keep node costs low and the goal of extending
   battery lifetime. However there is a growing need to support real-time
   streaming of audio and/or low-rate video even in wireless sensor
   networks for use in emergency situations and short-term intruder
   detection. In this paper we present FireFly, a time-synchronized sensor
   network platform for real-time data streaming across multiple hops.
   FireFly is composed of several integrated layers including specialized
   low-cost hardware, a sensor network operating system, a real-time link
   layer and network scheduling which together provide efficient supportfor
   applications with timing constraints. In order to achieve high
   end-to-end throughput, bounded latency andpredictable lifetime, we
   employ hardware-based time synchronization. Multiple tasks including
   audio sampling, networking and sensor reading are scheduled using the
   NanoRK RTOS. We have implemented RT-Link, a TDMA-based link layer
   protocol for message exchange on well-defined time slots and pipelining
   along multiple hops. We use this platform to support 2-way audio
   streaming concurrently with sensing tasks. For interactive voice, we
   investigate TDMA-based slot scheduling with balanced bi-directional
   latency while meeting audio timeliness requirements. Finally, we
   describe our experimental deployment of 42 nodes in a coal mine, and
   present measurements of the end-to-end throughput, jitter packet loss
   and voice quality}},

Abstract = {{One of the key challenges for high-density servers (e.g., blades) is the
   increased costs in addressing the power and heat density associated with
   compaction. Prior approaches have mainly focused on reducing the heat
   generated at the level of an individual server. In contrast, this work
   proposes power efficiencies at a larger scale by leveraging statistical
   properties of concurrent resource usage across a collection of systems
   ({''}ensemble{''}). Specifically, we discuss an implementation of this
   approach at the blade enclosure level to monitor and manage the power
   across the individual blades in a chassis. Our approach requires
   low-cost hardware modifications and relatively simple software support.
   We evaluate our architecture through both prototyping and simulation.
   For workloads representing 132 servers from nine different enterprise
   deployments, we show significant power budget reductions at performances
   comparable to conventional systems.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: The differentiation between low-grade astrocytomas and anaplastic
   astrocytomas is susceptible to considerable inter-observer variability.
   In order to contribute to a better standardization of
   astrocytoma-grading based on quantitative data, the present study
   focuses on two important aspects not being considered in previous
   morphometric studies: elaboration of a decision flow chart for tumor
   grading based on morphometric parameters and appropriate cut-off-values,
   easily performed using low-cost equipment such as measuring oculars;
   investigation of the distribution (histograms) of parameters describing
   nuclear size and internuclear distance, which had been represented in
   previous studies by their mean and standard deviation only. Material and
   methods: At least 300 tumor cell nuclei per case were investigated in
   paraffin sections from surgical specimen of 75 patients with
   astrocytomas WHO grade II (n = 23) and anaplastic astrocytomas WHO grade
   III (n = 52) by means of a digital image analysis system. Results: The
   morphometric data showed significant differences between both groups of
   tumors. According to multivariate analysis, the best contribution to
   tumor grading was achieved by means of parameters concerning the
   distribution of values for nuclear diameters and internuclear distances.
   A decision tree was constructed using a knowledge based algorithm, which
   provided astrocytoma grading based on the distribution of values for
   nuclear diameter, as well as the numerical nuclear density and
   proliferation index. Measurements using a measuring ocular took an
   acceptable amount of time (1.5 hour per case) and showed good
   reproducibility when compared with measurement by means of digital image
   analysis. Conclusion: The study demonstrates that a morphometric
   examination of tumor cell nuclei in paraffin sections supports the
   clinically important differential diagnosis between low-grade and
   high-grade astrocytomas. The method for classification and the data
   published in the present study constitute a good basis for a
   standardized and reproducible grading procedure for astrocytomas, which
   can be performed in any histologic laboratory even without a digital
   image analysis system.}},

Abstract = {{To realize the low power consumption and low-cost equipment needed to
   decode high definition broadcasts, Fujitsu has developed a single-chip
   multicore processor FR1000 that integrates four 8-way, Very Long
   Instruction Word (VLIW) FR-V processor cores. This new multicore
   processor is fabricated using a 90 nm, nine-metal-layer CMOS process and
   a 900-pin flip-chip package. The processor cores operate at 500 MHz, the
   memory interfaces at 250 MHz, and system bus at 166 MHz. The use of a
   single processor core enables MPEG-2 MP@ ML video-stream decoding at 190
   MHz. Conversely,the use of four processor cores enables the decoding of
   MPEG-2 MP@HL video streams by just using software. Moreover, this new
   processor needs only about 3 W to decode MPEG-2 MP@HL video streams.
   This paper introduces the hardware and software development environment

   used to calculate its movement. The updating of the mutual localization
   uses data sharing between platforms but does not require visual contact

   landmark detection. While landmark locations are unknown, their
   positions within the field of view of the platforms are used for

Abstract = {{High quality wood sanding machines require information about the wood
   surface shape in order to control actuators pushing the sanding paper
   onto the wood surface. In order to improve the quality of the sanding
   process a 3D measurement system is currently under development within an
   EU FP6 project. Several constraints (especially panel size and available
   measurement system volume) prohibit using off-the-shelf measurement
   systems. The measurement system is based on laser line triangulation and
   consists of two inclined 675 nm lasers equipped with line diffraction
   optics, a high resolution camera, and a standard PC all mounted into a
   rigid frame. Two mirrors direct the laser light onto the wood panel
   moving beneath the measurement system. The surface resolution is 1.1
   mm/pixel and the depth resolution is 0.4 mm/pixel. Measurements are
   performed at a rate of 25 frames/sec. The projected lines are detected
   with subpixel accuracy and converted into world (x, y, z) coordinates
   using calibration data. The measurement accuracy is approximately
   identical over the full width of the measurement system. In x and z
   direction the surface resolution is nearly constant. In y direction the
   resolution depends on the panel shape and speed. In case of shadowing
   (i.e. when only one line is visible) the resolution is 10 mm otherwise
   it is 5 mm.}},

Abstract = {{Airborne gravimetry is a technique for gravity field determination.
   Although it was first proposed in the seventies, it became feasible when
   the GPS navigation system became fully operational. Actually, the
   performance of airborne gravimetry strongly depends on the GPS
   technology. One of the key roles that GPS plays in airborne gravimetry,
   besides positioning, is the estimation of kinematic accelerations. It is
   known that the kinematic accelerations determination is quite sensitive
   on issues such as the satellite geometry, the event of cycle slips or on
   the availability of a reference station. But, as the GNSS scenario is
   about to change with the European Galileo, the modernization of the GPS
   and the renewed GLONASS, it is worth to review the current approaches.
   This paper reviews the current state of kinematic acceleration
   determination within the frame of airborne gravimetry and proposes an
   approach taking into account the coming scenario, mainly focusing on
   Galileo.
   Airborne gravimetry is a ``precise market{''} application. In this
   context it is assumed that the cost of high-end equipment is negligible
   as compared to the additional maneuvering and surveying required by
   low-cost equipment. There is also no compelling need of real time
   processing, allowing to analyze and prepare the data (if needed) before
   its processing.
   However, logistics and mission planning is a big issue. In terms of
   logistics, a flexible operation is needed due to the large areas to be
   surveyed and its accessibility (rainforest, coastal regions or
   mountainous areas, for example) or adverse climatology. As a precise
   application, the use of a reference station to meet the accuracy and
   precision requirements might be essential. This requires a flexible and
   agile operation of the reference station.
   This paper considers the use of no reference station. The reason is
   twofold. First, because in this paper the Galileo contribution in
   accuracy and precision without differential techniques wants to be
   explored. The second reason is to fully exploit one of the main
   advantages of airborne gravimetry. This is, the accessibility to remote
   areas of difficult access by land. In such scenario, the maintenance and
   set of a reference station might be difficult if not impossible. In few
   words, as a first step, the performance of the combined use of Galileo
   and GPS and its possible impact on improving the logistics and planning
   of airborne gravimetry missions is of major interest.
   In order to assess the impact of Galileo, simulated Galileo observations
   were generated by means of a simulator developed at the Institute of
   Engineering, Surveying and Space Geodesy of the University of
   Nottingham. The results presented show the precision of the estimated
   kinematic accelerations both with GPS alone and GPS and Galileo
   combined.}},

Abstract = {{in this paper, we improve the performance of the hierarchical detector
   we proposed in {[}1] for real-time software or low-cost hardware
   implementation. Although the original hierarchical detector is faster
   than sub-sampled brute force-base detector when processing marked
   images, it unnecessarily continues to process unmarked images looking
   for a watermark that is not present. This processing is time-consuming;
   hence, it represents a significant deployment obstacle. The improved
   detector, however, avoids most of the processing of the unmarked areas
   of an image by exploiting the presence of a reference signal usually
   included with the embedded watermark. This reference signal enables the
   detector to synchronize the image after it has been subjected to a
   geometric transformation (scaling, rotation, and translation). The
   improved detector refrains from searching an image area any further
   whenever the level of the reference signal is very weak or the estimated
   scale factors and rotation angles associated with this reference signal
   are not consistent among the processed blocks within the same layer in
   the hierarchy. The proposed detector has been implemented, and the
   experimental results indicate that the proposed detector is
   computationally more efficient with unmarked images, while achieving a
   detection rate similar to that of the original hierarchical detector.}},

Abstract = {{Children television productions have been using puppets for a long time.
   Since the early days of computer animation, computer puppet simulation
   has been researched intensively. Complex motion capture equipment allows
   nowadays the real time mapping of movement for virtual puppets (
   performance animation). However, the costs of capturing equipment are
   too high and the difference in the workflow make it difficult for small
   production teams to access and use such technology. This paper presents
   a system for the real time simulation of elastic latex hand puppets
   which are used in television productions. After an analysis of the
   production processes of real puppets and of the materials used for their
   production, the paper describes the components of the system simulating
   them. The system connects a high resolution visual mesh to a
   three-layered 3D mass spring mesh, which is used for the elastic
   simulation. Polygonal mesh decimation of the puppet surface model is
   used as a basis for generating the elastic mesh. From the decimated mesh
   a new metod is proposed for generating the internal layers of the
   mass-spring mesh. A data handglove is used for transmitting forces to
   the elastic mesh, indirectly moving the surface of the virtual puppet in
   real time. Dataglove interaction maps in a natural way the hand
   movements of a puppeteer to the computer model. The tradeoffs of the
   implementation on low cost hardware and its efficiency are also
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the investigation of an innovative low-cost
   receiver design for incoherent binary DPSK-systems. Due to device
   tolerances, the generated carrier frequencies of distant clients, i.e.
   communication transceivers, have always a slight difference which is
   known as frequency offset. At present several analog methods for the
   elimination of such frequency offsets are available, which require the
   implementation of a carrier recovery circuit, i.e. in form of a
   Costas-Loop or a Squaring-Loop. Besides these coherent receiver
   concepts, incoherent systems need expensive analog-to-digital converters
   to track the rotation of the points in the constellation. The introduced
   receiver, however, uses neither a carrier recovery circuit nor expensive
   analog-to-digital converters. This new concept is realized by a finite
   state machine (FSM) forming a baseband channel selection (BCS) control,
   which will be established in this paper. Finally, simulations prove the
   high quality of such incoherent DBPSK transceivers compared to coherent
   systems, using fully digital implemented low-cost hardware for decoding.}},

Abstract = {{A compact, reliable and low cost flow injection chemiluminescence system
   is described. The flow system consists of a set of solenoid micro-pumps
   that can dispense reproductive micro-volumes of solutions. The
   luminometer was based on a coiled cell constructed from polyethylene
   tubing that was sandwiched between two large area photodiodes. The whole
   equipment costs about US\$ 750 and weights ca. 3 kg. Equipment
   performance was evaluated by measuring low concentrations of hydrogen
   peroxide by oxidation of luminol and for the determination of ammonium,
   based on its inhibition of the luminescence provided by the reaction of
   luminol and sodium hypochlorite. Linear responses were achieved within
   1.0-80 mu mol L-1 H2O2 and 0.6-60 mu mol L-1 NH4+ with detection limits
   estimated as 400 nmol L-1 H2O2 and 60 nmol L-1 NH4+ at the 99.7\%
   confidence level. Coefficients of variation were 1.0 and 1.8\%,
   estimated for 20 mu mol L-1 H2O2 and 15 mu mol L-1 NH4+ (n = 20),
   respectively. Reagent consumption of 55 mu g luminol, effluent volume of
   950 mu L per determination and sampling rate of 120 samples per hour
   were also achieved. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The present paper describes a method for autofocusing specifically
   studied for the acquisition of digital slides, i.e. full histologic and
   cytologic slides. utilising low-cost equipment. At first,
   experimentations with some of the most used focus measures and
   algorithms have been made. in order to choose the most suitable for
   histologic and cytologic images. Then, a study of the specific features
   of digital slides has been preliminarily carried out in order to
   understand the constraints of the domain. These included the capability
   of autofocusing in an unattended way on thousands of microscope fields,
   while fast performance is not a strict requirement. Based on the
   findings, an algorithin based on a dynamic focus position space, with a
   variance-based focus measure has been adapted to the specific situation.
   A qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the proposed algorithin
   allowed us to show that the proposed algorithm is suitable for the
   acquisition of digital slides, and furthermore it can be implemented
   starting from a basic microscope with an inexpensive motorised stage.
   The algorithm is currently implemented into a complete digital slide
   acquisition system, which is in turn being used for a Quality Assurance

Month = {{FEB 28}},
Abstract = {{A spectrometric microtitrator was developed from a spectrometer with a
   microreaction chamber and a tri-colour light-emitting diode (LED) as the
   light source. A novel. vertical, optical geometry of the spectrometric
   microtitration chamber was introduced and tested. This novel geometry
   also required a new method for mixing the titrated solution. A
   laboratory-made 50 mul syringe pump was used for the addition of the
   titration reagent. The 10-channel module for light effects, which makes
   possible a low-cost hardware approach to changing the titration
   protocols. was used for coordinating the operation of the microtitration
   set up. The system, with 10 channels and a regulated speed of operation,
   is flexible enough to allow an operator to generate different titration
   protocols. The performance test showed that the speed of
   titration-reagent addition can be regulated in the range from 0.87 to
   21.8 mul min(-1). The smallest achievable volume addition is equal to 35
   nl. The mixing rate can be continuously regulated by an electrical Pulse
   that initiates the mixing cycle. The quickest rate is every 1.6 s, and
   the slowest rate is every 4.8 s. The spectrometric nucrotitration set up
   was Successfully tested for several different real-life spectrometric
   titrations, including an iodometric titration. a determination of CO2 in
   deionised water, and EDTA titrations of copper(II) ions with no
   indicator. The volume of the examined solution can be as small as 220
   mul. The titration-reagent consumption is usually between 10 and 35 mul.
   Coefficients of variation of the end point Volume determination (n = 5)
   at different experimental conditions and different average volumes of
   consumed reagents (7.06, 12.17 and 22.88 mul) were 2.4, 1.3 and 1.2\%.
   respectively. The novel geometry of the spectrometric microtitration
   chamber proved to be useful for real-life applications. (C) 2004

Abstract = {{Temperature cycling of semiconductor gas sensors is a very powerful tool
   for developing gas detection systems with high selectivity and
   stability. Micro-structured gas sensors - due to their low thermal mass
   - have very low thermal time constants in the range of 10 ms. Based on
   these sensors, the development of fast and highly selective gas
   detection systems is possible using temperature cycles with
   application-specific temperature levels and an overall duration of only
   a few seconds. For efficient evaluation of such systems, especially in
   industrial applications, we have developed a flexible and low-cost
   hardware platform which provides accurate temperature control for
   arbitrary temperature profiles and fast, high resolution data
   acquisition either in stand-alone operation or connected to a PC. A
   modern MCU provides 16 bit PWM outputs which are used both for
   temperature control and resistance read-out. A key feature of this
   platform is its large effective measurement range of 26 bit resulting
   from a combination of 16 bit PWM with a 10 bit ADC. Based on this
   hardware platform, various application-specific gas detection systems
   either for research or industrial purposes can be realized.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a spread spectrum-based watermark algorithm
   for real-time software or low-cost hardware implementation. The
   developed detector is suitable for devices such as stand-alone watermark
   readers, cellular phones, and PDAs. These devices have primitive
   operating systems with limited processing power, memory, and system
   bandwidth. Our embedder tiles the watermark over the host image to let
   the watermark be detected from any region in the digital or printed
   watermarked image as the data is streamed through the device. It also
   adapts the watermark strength locally to maximize detection and minimize
   watermark visibility. Consequently, the watermark may be detectable only
   in few regions of the image that are not necessarily aligned with the
   original tile boundaries. To avoid a brute-force search, our detector
   uses a hierarchical search algorithm to quickly zoom into the region
   with the strongest watermark. This approach permits a real-time software
   implementation of the detector and reduces the necessary gate count,
   on-chip memory, and system bandwidth for a hardware implementation.
   Software simulation results of the developed algorithm indicate that the
   algorithm is very efficient and the detection results are better than
   those obtained using a sub-sampled brute-force search.}},

Abstract = {{With the new and powerful Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) families,
   new possibilities have been opened. One of these features is the
   possibility of reconfiguring a section of the FPGA while the rest is
   working. Moreover, this fixed part could be responsible for
   reprogramming the reconfigurable part, either because a change in
   functionality is required or because a new version of the hardware needs
   to be implemented. This paper shows how an FPGA system based on an Open
   Source OpenRISC 1200 microprocessor takes advantage of this feature to
   perform the Secure Download of the firmware and the hardware needed to
   run an application. In this particular case a Reed-Solomon Encoder and a
   Cryptographic application were used to demonstrate the viability of the

Abstract = {{We propose a new fingerprint classification method based on a feature
   map consisting of orientation and inter-ridge spacing for the latent
   fingerprint retrieval within the large-scale databases. It is designed
   for the continuous classification methodology. This method captures
   unique characteristics for each fingerprint from the distribution of
   combined features of orientation and inter-ridge spacing of local area.
   The merit of the proposed approach is that it has translation invariant
   property and is rubust againt registration error since it is not
   necessary to locate the core position. Our experiments show that the
   performance of the proposed approach is comparable to the MASK method,
   and when it is combined with other classifier i.e. PCASYS, the result
   classifier out-performes any single classifier previously proposed.
   Moreover, it can be implemented in the low cost hardware such as
   embedded fingerprint system since the new algorithm saves the processing
   time.}},

Abstract = {{The open model for solutions development is quickly extending from
   software to other technology areas, such as hardware and services.
   Specifically, just as open source has spawned a revolution in the
   technical, business, and legal model for software, open hardware will
   provide a swell of collaborative innovation that will create entirely
   new markets and provide significant business benefits to the most
   creative, most reliable, and most adaptable semiconductor, EDA,
   System-On-Chip (SoC) and systems houses. The open-source software stack
   with Linux as its cornerstone is increasingly the preferred choice for
   newly venture-funded companies. Open hardware will also change the world
   of SoC venture investing. While the degree of openness and the business
   model may vary, SoC products have to be increasingly developed through a
   collaborative model that helps assemble IP blocks and services from
   multiple sources. In this paper we describe the open standards model for
   hardware, chip, and tool innovation, and we argue the a systematic IP
   valuation methodology will help the success of this. environment, in
   that it will allow each member of the value chain especially small

   request from ADE or DAE user and determinate whether ADE or DAE can be
   run on client's PC. As a result, the system security is improved in a
   sense. Additionally, the system hardware part comprises two kinds of
   terminal portable instruments: DASOC(data-acquisition system on chip
   based-on the Cygnal MCU) and DSAI(dynamic signal analysis instrument
   based on an embedded OS:XPE). DASOC and DSAI can realize
   data-acquisition, signal analysis and data-transmission based-on
   internet. The system structure mode has been applied to a certain power
   plant's enterprise information network in Tianjin. Results show that the
   system is successful.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrawideband (UWB) has been attracting attentions by promising very
   high data rates along with low cost hardware and low power consumption.
   However, since UWB occupies a very wide frequency band, it is forced to
   coexist with numerous powerful licensed communication systems
   transmithing in the same band. The interference caused by these systems
   may complicate or even block the UWB communications. In the literature,
   there is considerable amount of work regarding narrowband interference
   (NBI) suppression. Most of the proposed methods, which can be classified
   as NBI avoidance and NBI cancellation techniques, require interference
   statistics. In this paper, we propose an NBI identification approach,
   which aims at figuring out some useful interference statistics by
   assuming some preliminary information about the possible sources of NBI.}},

Abstract = {{Chromatic dispersion (CD) in single-mode optical fiber distorts pulses
   and is a big obstacle against the upgrading of long-haul, dynamically
   routed wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) transmission systems at 10
   Gbit/s and beyond. High-performance adaptive dispersion compensators are
   required as well as reliable low-cost hardware for the detection of
   residual CD. Targeting high-capacity metro systems, full-band 1.6-Tb/s
   (40x40Gbit/s) adaptive CD compensation is demonstrated in this
   experiment, using CSRZ-ASK and NRZ-DPSK modulation formats. A
   multichannel dispersion compensator, tunable in the range -700 to -1500
   ps/nm, is automatically controlled by arrival time detection in one of
   the 40 transmitted WDM channels. Dispersion and its slope are timed
   simultaneously by a thermal gradient of the grating-based compensator to
   match the parameters of standard single-mode fiber (SSMF) with lengths
   between 44 and 94 km.}},

   coordination scheme relies on low-bandwidth local communication, well
   suited to SAR environments, but also provides sufficient unit autonomy

   verified through cooperation and coordination of multiple viewpoints and
   data streams. The resulting system provides excellent flexibility,

Abstract = {{Manual harvesting is the most limiting operational handicap for the
   expansion of hazelnut cropping in Portugal, but importing equipment is
   not a realistic alternative because it is very expensive and is not
   adapted to Portuguese hazelnut orchards.
   In an attempt to overcome this shortcoming, a small-sized and low-cost
   equipment is being developed for mechanical harvesting and two others
   were prepared for calibration and shelling, all within the scope of an
   AGRO 162 project called ``Yield increase of hazelnut crops in
   Portugal{''}.
   The hazelnut harvesting equipment is composed of a hopper, a four-stroke
   engine, a ventilator, two flexible tubes for conveying the draw-in
   material and a wheelbarrow required to drive the assemblage. The
   calibrator is built with three iron sieves mounted in a sloping position
   to allow the hazelnuts to roll. The shelling equipment is essentially
   made of a metallic roll driven by an electrical engine, with two rulers,
   positioned in accordance with the generating roll, that compress the
   hazelnuts against a wood ruler. The distance between the roll and the
   wood ruler can be adjusted.
   The trials on hazelnut harvesting allowed us to obtain a work rate of
   between 23 to 40 h/ha, depending on the conditions of the test. The
   calibrator was designed to obtain four different lot sizes. The shelling
   equipment performances depended greatly on the size of the lot, the best
   results being obtained with the biggest hazelnuts.
   To summarise it can be stated that this harvesting equipment is a
   reasonable solution for low acreage orchards, where a low work rate is
   allowed, due to its low price. The shelling equipment provides a good
   percentage of shelled hazelnuts in the upper lots, but in the lower ones
   it is necessary to do more than one shelling operation; this limitation
   can be reduced with the incorporation of more sieves to get more lots of
   small hazelnuts.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a simple active contour based visual tracking algorithm
   is presented for outdoor AGV application which is currently under
   development at the USM robotic research group (URRG) lab. The presented
   algorithm is computationally low cost and able to track road boundaries
   in an image sequence and can easily be implemented on available low cost
   hardware. The proposed algorithm used an active shape modeling using the
   B-spline deformable template and recursive curve fitting method to track
   the current orientation of the road.}},

Abstract = {{A hardware random number generator is different from a pseudo-random
   number generator; a pseudo-random number Generator approximates the
   assumed behavior of a real hardware random number generator. Simple
   pseudo random number generators suffices for most applications, however
   for demanding situations such as the generation of cryptographic keys,
   requires an efficient and a cost effective source of random numbers.
   Arbiter-based Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) proposed for physical
   authentication of ICs exploits statistical delay variation of wires and
   transistors across integrated circuits, as a result of process
   variations, to build a secret key unique to each IC. Experimental
   results and theoretical studies show that a sufficient amount of
   variation exits across IC's. This variation enables each IC to be
   identified securely.
   It is possible to exploit the unreliability of these PUF responses to
   build a physical random number generator. There exists measurement
   noise, which comes from the instability of an arbiter when it is in a
   racing condition. There exist challenges whose responses are
   unpredictable. Without environmental variations, the responses of these
   challenges are random in repeated measurements.
   Compared to other physical random number generators, the PUF-based
   random number generators can be a compact and a low-power solution since
   the generator need only be turned on when required. A 64-stage PLTF
   circuit costs less than 1000 gates and the circuit can be implemented
   using a standard IC manufacturing processes.
   In this paper we have presented a fast and an efficient random number
   generator, and analysed the quality of random numbers produced using an
   array of tests used by the National Institute of Standards and
   Technology to evaluate the randomness of random number generators
   designed for cryptographic applications.}},

Abstract = {{The study of electromagnetic wave propagation in a coaxial cable can be
   a powerful approach to the study of waves at an undergraduate level.
   This study can explore different experimental situations, going from
   those where the finite velocity of propagation must be considered
   (distributed or transmission line behaviour), to those where this
   velocity may be considered infinite (lumped behaviour). We believe that
   the student observation of the existence of these two regimes can be
   important for the understanding of wave phenomena in general. In this
   work we show that this can be achieved using low-cost equipment and a
   set of quite simple experiments, such as the measurement of wave
   propagation velocity or the study of standing waves and resonance. The
   results obtained in a coherent set of selected experiments are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A packet switch with parallel switching planes is a parallel packet
   switch (PPS). A PPS can scale-up to faster line speeds than can a
   single-plane switch. It is an open problem to design a PPS that is
   feasible to implement using existing low-cost hardware components where
   no component runs faster than line speed. A PPS must be able to
   internally load balance traffic, have packet delays comparable to a
   reference single-plane switch, and provide QoS (bandwidth, delay, and
   loss guarantees) to flows. We investigate a new architecture for a PPS
   that uses virtual input queues (VIQ) in the output multiplexors to
   achieve packet-level load balancing. A VIQ at an output multiplexor
   consists of one FIFO queue for each input. For K planes and N ports, our
   VIQ PPS requires KN cells of buffering in the input demultiplexors and
   2NK + 2K cells of buffering in the output multiplexors to achieve
   guaranteed loss-free operation and in-order cell delivery. Using
   simulation models, the new VIQ PPS is shown to offer improved delay
   performance compared to existing PPS designs. For balanced and
   unbalanced loads the VIQ PPS is stable where a reference iSLIP
   single-plane switch is unstable. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   the specific fuel type, mostly for coals. The development of new highly
   informative analytical methods is necessary to compare the different
   combustion behavior of fuels of different origin. A new method basically
   meets these demands. The analysis technique is based on the thermal

   limit of detection of 0.3 mg/L. Repeatability of the proposed method is
   good, and the relative standard deviation (RSD\%) is less than 1.5\%.
   Interferences studies showed that the common compounds existing in

   of bubbles in a test cell made of perspex is presented. The method is
   based on the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide solution (H2O2) to
   oxygen and water in aqueous media at the presence of a catalyst. By
   using an appropriate H2O2-concentration, the gas evolution rate can be
   set to same order of magnitude as in real direct methanol fuel cells.
   This approach allows the simulation of the flow distribution in DMFC by
   simple low-cost hardware. As no current conducting parts are needed, the
   whole dummy cell can be made of perspex to ensure a complete visibility
   of the flow.
   In a perspex flow cell with an active area of 600 cm(2) the flow
   homogeneity as a function of gas evolution rate, flow field and manifold
   design was investigated. Experiments show that splayed manifolds have a
   superior performance concerning flow uniformity compared to other
   designs. The use of grid structures as a flow field gives good bubble
   transport at all investigated current densities. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

   recognition speed and certainty have to be satisfied by means of

   different local environments along a demonstrated, designated route
   using a lookup-table representation. This method utilizes limited

   environments, with respect to the robot.. for navigation along the
   learned route in order to achieve good performance with low on-line
   computational demand and low-cost hardware requirements. Experimental
   study demonstrates the feasibility of this method and some interesting
   characteristics of navigation and its associated localization and

Abstract = {{PAROTO is a joint project investigating obstacle detection and avoidance
   by fusion of information from radar and infrared imagery, with the
   support of the French ministry of Research. The PAROTO consortium

   Detection of obstacles by radar and infrared exhibit different
   properties so their concurrent use allows optimal performance.
   Innovative image processing algorithms have been set up to detect
   vehicles and pedestrians (see {[}6]). Original 77 GHz radar was also
   specified and realised. Fusion of information exploits a sound
   mathematical framework getting the best of both alarm sources. Then a
   filtering step eliminates pointless alarms, when it is clear that the
   driver has already taken appropriate actions regarding the obstacle. A
   dedicated driver's interface was also designed and realised to warn -
   visually and/or acoustically - without unnecessarily driving the
   driver's gaze out of the road ahead.
   Both detection schemes already operate in real time. By the end of 2003,
   the fusion of information, integrated aboard our tested vehicle, will be
   evaluated together with the driver interface, providing valuable insight
   into automated perception dedicated to automotive safety. Results
   strongly incite us to anticipate the design of a low cost hardware
   dedicated to these functions.}},

Abstract = {{A current focus of many instrumentation and Automatic Test Equipment
   (ATE) designers is the area of Synthetic Instrumentation. This
   instrumentation, which consists of physically separate building blocks
   or modules, provides the opportunity to reduce the system's overall
   hardware content by eliminating common hardware functionality located
   within each traditional instrument. This modular design provides
   opportunities for lower lifecycle cost, smaller physical packages and
   increased capabilities through module upgrades. However, the design of
   synthetic instrumentation and its integration into an ATE system poses
   technical challenges not typically seen with traditional
   instrumentation.
   Traditional instrument developers are now faced with the challenge of
   determining how their existing and future modules, for example a
   digitizer or waveform generator, satisfy a portion of the requirements
   of a synthetic instrument. ATE developers are challenged to identify the
   proper set of modules, primarily Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS), that
   together satisfy the system level requirements. In addition, they must
   address instrumentation concurrency, synchronization, switching, and
   develop a software and hardware architecture that supports future
   upgrades as technology advances. Each of these issues requires a strong
   system engineering discipline that can develop a robust system
   architecture.
   In 2002 SEI began a program to integrate synthetic instrumentation that
   provided the functionality of a spectrum analyzer, A/D converter,
   counter timer, UART and AVMUX into a legacy Air Force Test Station. In
   2003 SEI continued with an additional program that consisted of design
   and development of a synthetic instrument that provided the
   functionality of a power meter, spectrum analyzer, frequency time
   interval counter, oscilloscope and digital multi meter. During each of
   these programs SEI worked directly with commercial instrument
   manufacturers, electrical designers and the military to establish the
   system requirements and resulting architecture. This paper will describe
   the key technical issues encountered while defining the system
   architecture including concurrency, modularity, synchronization, and
   maintaining an open hardware and software architecture. In addition, the
   resultant system architecture will be described.}},

Abstract = {{The use of low-cost GPS receivers and antennas for attitude
   determination can significantly reduce the overall hardware system cost.
   Compared to the use of high performance GPS receivers, the carrier phase
   measurements from low-cost equipment are subject to additional carrier
   phase measurement errors, such as multipath, antenna phase centre
   variation and noise. These error sources, together with more frequent
   cycle slip occurrences, severely deteriorate attitude determination
   availability, reliability and accuracy performance. This paper presents
   the investigation of a low-cost GPS/gyro integration system for attitude
   determination. By employing the dead reckoning sensor type, the
   ambiguity search region can be specifically defined as a small cube to
   enhance the ambiguity resolution process. A Kalman filter is implemented
   to fuse the rate gyro data with GPS carrier phase measurements. The
   quality control system based on innovation sequences is used to identify
   cycle slip occurrences and incorrect inter-antenna vector Solutions. The
   availability of the integrated system also improves with respect to the
   GPS standalone system since the attitude parameters can be estimated
   using the angular rate measurements from rate gyros during GPS outages.
   The low-cost hardware used to design and test the integrated system
   consists of CMC Allstar receivers with the OEM AT575-70 antennas and
   Murata ENV-05D-52 piezoelectric vibrating rate gyroscopes. Tests in the
   urban area demonstrated that the introduction of rate gyros in a
   GPS-based attitude determination system not only effectively decreased
   the noise level in the estimated attitude parameters but coasted the
   attitude output during GPS outages and also significantly improved the
   system reliability.}},

   relatively low-cost equipment along with currently deployed first
   responders in the maritime sectors. As such, it provides a logical
   potential solution to the current dilemma faced by the majority of
   accountable first responder organizations of needing expensive -- and
   likely unaffordable -- underwater surveillance equipment in U.S. port
   and harbor facilities. The threat assessment and employment concept are
   a focus of this presentation. Field trials conducted during August 2004

Abstract = {{Surface over volume rendering can be useful for many applications.
   However, the tremendously large number of polygons composing the surface
   primitives should be reduced to a manageable size so as to utilize the
   capability of low cost hardware and software rendering engines, a
   standard Internet protocol and VRML format. In this paper, we propose a
   novel algorithm that deletes several vertices simultaneously by forming
   a closed arbitrary shaped boundary. The Stokes' theorem, used in
   electro-magnetic field analysis, was newly adapted to extract the
   arbitrary shaped boundary. The simultaneous deletion procedure provides
   a computational gain and increases the reduction ratio without
   sacrificing the topological distortion of the original mesh. Numerically
   synthesized polygonal objects and real CT data were tested to evaluate
   the performance of the new algorithm and to demonstrate the possibility
   of a medical rendering application. The new algorithm outperforms the
   conventional decimation algorithm in both computational and reduction
   efficiency. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{279-285}},
Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{In agricultural machines and facilities, low-cost equipment and low
   energy consumption are necessary to reduce production costs. Pipe bends
   are very common in drip and sprinkler irrigation systems. When water
   passes through a pipe bend, the water pressure at the outside radius of
   the bend is higher than that at the inside due to the centrifugal force
   of the flowing water. If the inside and outside radii of the pipe are
   connected by a pipe, a bypass flow is generated in this route. For a
   given pipe bend and hydraulic resistance of the bypass route, the ratio
   (q/Q) of the bypass flow discharge (q) and the main pipe flow discharge
   (Q) is a constant coefficient. Thus, a pipe bend with a bypass route can
   be used as a flow meter to predict the flow rate and total discharge of
   the main pipe based on the measured bypass flow discharge and total
   amount of bypass flow water In addition, the ratio q/Q changes with
   regulation of the hydraulic resistance of the bypass route, so the
   designed value of q/Q can be obtained by inserting a different-size
   orifice into the bypass route. Based on results of hydraulic
   experiments, a hydraulic design procedure for a bypass flow meter using
   a pipe bend is proposed. Since the bypass flow discharge is very small
   in comparison with the main pipe flow discharge, the bypass route can
   use a smaller, less expensive meter to accurately measure the main pipe
   flow discharge and the total amount of irrigation water The cost becomes
   extremely low when domestic water meters are used to measure the bypass
   flow because they are mass produced and relatively inexpensive.}},

Abstract = {{A nephelometric technique based on a liquid drop is described for the
   measurement of atmospheric sulfur dioxide. A 40-mul drop of barium
   chloride and hydrogen peroxide solution is suspended in a flowing-air
   sampling stream. The sulfur (IV) collected is oxidized to sulfur (VI)
   and finally precipitated as barium sulfate. Nephelometric detection of
   drop is achieved by an appropriate arrangement consisting of an optical
   fiber contacting the drop and a photodiode placed at 90degrees relative
   to the fiber. The design and characteristics of this drop-based gas
   sensor system are described. The analytical response, as photocurrent,
   is proportional to the product of the sampling period and the sulfur

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a globally adaptive decentralized control
   scheme of time-varying robot manipulators for trajectory tracking
   control. Since the proposed adaptive control law is in a decentralized
   manner, only low-cost hardware is required for implementation.
   Furthermore, even if the time-varying parameters of the robot
   manipulator change arbitrarily fast, both the position and velocity
   tracking errors of the manipulators will converge to zero after
   employment of the proposed adaptive control law. For practical
   implementation, the adaptive law can be combined with a leakage term so
   that there is no chattering in the motion of the manipulator but at the
   price a residual set of the tracking errors as mentioned above, of which
   the size can be however made smaller by use of some larger design
   parameters. Finally, in order to illustrate the performance of the
   proposed scheme, simulation results are also provided, which turn out to
   be quite satisfactory.}},

Abstract = {{This subject is part of a more challenging research project aimed at
   developing a computer vision system, embedded in a car, and capable of
   identifying and locating road signs. Several constraints limit the
   possible solutions are first identified. For instance in such an
   application, we definitely need a real-time system; in addition, we wish
   to limit our choice to a single camera methodology to keep the hardware
   as simple as possible and finally our approach must work efficiently on
   low cost hardware. For this purpose we first rely on a color
   segmentation strategy to recognize the road signs. We have studied the
   behavior of the RGB components of several road signs from sunrise to
   sunset. From these results we have shown that the simple comparison of
   the RGB components taken two by two is sufficient to segment road signs
   in real-time. From this segmentation it should be much easier to
   identify the shape (and meaning) of a particular sign.}},

Abstract = {{We propose an image representation method appropriate for real-time
   visual geometry applications. If the expressive power of raw segments is
   augmented with robust color information from their two sides, the most
   relevant geometric and photometric structure in the image can be
   concisely captured. In this paper we describe an efficient algorithm to
   compute this kind of representation, which can be successfully exploited
   in several projective geometry problems, such as 3D reconstruction,
   motion estimation or calibration, and in interpretation related tasks.
   We also show how these enhanced primitives are powerful enough to
   recover a very acceptable approximation of the original image,
   especially for partially structured scenes, like interior of buildings,
   man-made objects, and so on. The algorithm works at frame rate for
   medium size images (PAL/2), using low-cost hardware, such as an
   off-the-self image acquisition card and a standard PC. This makes it
   very useful as an online feature extraction method for robot visual
   navigation, where more elaborated (and slower) methods can not be used.
   We describe some applications of the algorithm in this kind of tasks.}},

Abstract = {{An increasing interest towards the utilization of open hardware and
   software platforms for industrial control applications has arisen during
   the last decade. Some of the most important developed projects are OSACA
   in Europe, OSEC in Japan and OMAC in the US. All these efforts are
   directed to the definition of an open architecture for controllers of
   manufacturing systems. The PC (personal computer) as the control
   platform facilitates the conectivity, standardization and availability
   of components, and the cost reduction. An aspect, however, remains
   scarcely analized: the application of these concepts on equipments
   designed with a propietary control structure. An open control system for
   an SCARA industrial robot YAMAHA YK7000 has been developed to analize
   its viability and evaluate difficulties and limitations. The controller
   follows the guidelines defined by the OMAC architecture (Open Modular
   Architecture for Controllers). The control functions were implemented on
   a dual platform (two PCs): The first PC supports the critical functions.
   executing the paths planning and axes control tasks with a commercial
   axes control card. The second one supports the functions of user
   interfacing with the user and other non-critical time applications. Both
   computers are connected by a TCP/IP link.}},

   regional features and shape information in pattern recognition and image
   understanding tasks. In the present paper, a general approach for
   low-cost hardware-realization of multidimensional binary morphological
   operations is proposed. The underlying definitions of Minkowski-addition
   and Minkowski-subtraction are reduced to linear n-D convolutions, which
   lead to several alternative implementations. The flexible architecture
   of modern FPGAs allows the construction of operations,with fixed and
   variable sized structuring-elements that handle regions of up to 1000
   object elements (e.g. pixels) in parallel. This leads to low-cost
   hardware realizations of real-time computer vision tasks. Possible clock
   frequencies of more than 100 MHz provide morphological image processing
   for camera resolution of 320 x 240 pixel at frame rates of over 1000 Hz.}},

Abstract = {{The Portland State Aerospace Society (PSAS) is a small, low-budget
   amateur aerospace group. PSAS is currently developing medium-sized
   sub-orbital rockets with the eventual goal of inserting nanosatellites
   (satellites that weigh less than 10 kg) into orbit. Because achieving
   orbit requires a navigation system able to guide the rocket along an
   orbital trajectory, PSAS is pioneering an open source and open hardware
   avionics system that is capable of active guidance.
   In this paper, we describe how free software and open hardware have
   dramatically changed the capabilities of amateur aerospace groups like
   PSAS. We show how we have applied existing and custom free software to
   the avionics and ground support systems of a sub-orbital sounding
   rocket, and discuss what further work must be done.
   We conclude that the sophistication and complexity achieved by current
   amateur avionics projects-which are beginning to challenge the
   distinction between amateur and professional-would not be possible
   without the use of free software.}},

Title = {{Reservoir productivity increase appliying the underbalanced drilling
   technology}},
Journal = {{VISION TECNOLOGICA}},

Volume = {{10}},

Pages = {{157-168}},
Abstract = {{Search to improve reservoir productivity is a constant issue in oil
   industry. Specifically in well drilling operations, new technologies are
   continuously developed. As to underbalanced drilling, this technology
   has become a very advantageous alternative, compared to conventional
   drilling to increase reservoir productivity, When drilling with a
   pressure gradient favorable to formation, formation damage risks are
   considerably diminished, This will allow exploiting a reservoir without
   drilling too many wells, due to its high productivity. On the other
   hand, use of this technology in low-production pressurized reservoirs
   implies that increase of well productivity would greatly compensate
   investments performed in equipment. This can be achieved, either by
   adapting low cost equipment (fit for service), or by massively
   implanting the technology in a reservoir. In this paper both technical
   and economic aspects that condition underbalanced drilling application
   as a technology to improve reservoir productivity are entirely analyzed.
   Proper selection of candidate wells are considered, using a data base
   and similar wells, to evaluate adaptability of the technology, as well
   to estimate the increase of production because of the use of the
   technology in a hypothetical case of an oil reservoir and a real case of
   a condensate gas reservoir. Also, reference is made to different
   formation damage mechanisms that will not be necessary to apply if
   underbalanced drilling is used. Concerning the economic aspect,
   implication of the production simulator, as well as of the reservoir
   useful lifetime, on the calculations of the project net present value
   (NPV) is taken into account, considering application of underbalanced
   operations both in well drilling and well workover Successful and
   systematic application of this technology is associated to the need of
   creating work teams of professionals from all the stages of the
   production chain value.}},

Abstract = {{The emerging research interests in home network and other wireless
   consumer electronic products have led to an increased demand for an
   effective and low cost approach for multi-user communications. In this
   paper we propose a novel multi-user spread spectrum (SS) communication
   system based on chaos theory for multimedia transmission in a wireless
   home network environment. Using the ergodic property of chaos, the
   proposed chaotic SS system is shown to be able to modulate and transmit
   the multimedia signal effectively for point-to-point communication. In
   order to cater for home network service and other applications, our
   method is further extended for multi-user communication based on time
   division multiple access, while all users can share the whole frequency
   spectrum, different time slots are allocated to different users for
   transmission. Monte Carlo simulations are carried out to evaluate the
   effectiveness of the multi-user analog chaotic SS system. Compared with
   the conventional CDMA system, it is shown that the proposed system has
   improved and satisfactory performance in transmitting analog multimedia
   signals even when the channel measurement noise is strong. In addition,
   since the proposed system is with very low cost hardware implementation,
   it is quite suitable for home network and other consumer electronic
   products.}},

Abstract = {{Imprint lithography is a candidate for high-resolution, high-throughput
   lithography using low-cost equipment. In particular, imprinting using
   photo-induced solidification is very attractive because it eliminates
   heat-up, cool-down time and avoids thermal expansion problems inherent
   in conventional thermal imprinting. We demonstrate the replication of
   uniform 100 nm line and space (L/S) patterns over a 5 mm x 5 mm area at
   a time, a 60 nm L/S pattern and a 90-nm-wide line with an aspect ratio
   of 2 by imprinting using photo-induced solidification. We studied the
   removal of a base layer by O-2 reactive ion etching (RIE) and determined
   the criteria for the base layer and imprinted patterns. Change in line
   width through O-2 RIE is not affected by the base layer thickness but is
   affected by etching time. We found that granules generated in polymer
   during O-2 RIE are slowly etched and the resulting long removal time of
   granules degrades the quality of imprinted patterns or prevents patterns
   from standing. It is necessary to achieve a base layer which is less
   than 100 nm thick or to change the O-2 RIE conditions so that the
   polymer dose not granulate and/or use granulation-resistant polymers.}},

Abstract = {{Aerial photographs can be used to produce and update terrain surface
   maps. This procedure, however, requires the use of expensive equipment
   which is not readily available to most offices which use such maps.
   Advances in computer science and the availability of low cost equipment
   for digitizing and digital processing of aerial photographs, allows for
   a wide range of applications for the production of cartographic
   information of the terrain surface by digital means, one of them being
   digital mono-plotting. This is the production of planimetric information
   of a terrain surface by direct vectorization. on a digital aerial
   photograph, using an image display for digitizing all significant
   features of the terrain, and afterwards performing an analytical
   transformation on those vectors in order to correct the deformations
   intrinsic to the aerial photographs.
   In the situation of non-flat terrain. a rigorous transformation has to
   be performed on the digitized lines (vectors), using colinearity
   equations based on control points of known coordinates and the digital
   elevation model (DEM) of the terrain. In such a way, deformations due to
   relief displacement and photographic tilt are corrected, obtaining a map
   free of deformations, at a known scale and referenced to a terrain
   coordinate system. To obtain the planimetric position of an image point
   on the terrain surface, the intersection point of the corresponding
   projective ray with the DEM of the terrain must be determined. In
   general, this is an iterative and time-consuming procedure. In this
   paper an alternative direct solution to this problem is presented with
   an example application. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The design and realization of a vision-based target tracking system is

   the only information available for the camera control to be achieved
   correctly. This embedded system requires low-cost hardware for
   surveillance or attack drone applications: a digital signal processor
   for the image processing, and a microcontroller for the camera control.
   To ensure real-time video operation, an algorithmic solution integrating
   a successive-step and multi-block search method is implemented, thus
   allowing complex target displacements. The microcontroller uses this

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a parallel micro genetic algorithm based on merit
   order loading solutions (PMGA-MOL) to solve constrained dynamic economic
   dispatch (DED) problems for combined cycle (CC) units with linear
   decreasing and decreasing staircase incremental cost (IC) functions. To
   minimize the synchronization overheads, the PMGA-MOL employs the load
   balancing and migration strategies among processors. This PMGA-MOL
   algorithm is implemented on the eight-processor scalable multicomputer
   implementation using low-cost equipment (SMILE) Beowulf cluster with a
   fast ethernet switch network on the generating unit system size in the
   range of 5-80 units over the entire dispatch periods. With different
   migration strategies, the proposed PMGA-MOL compromises the solution
   quality and speedup upper bounds for the best performance. PMGA-MOL is
   shown to be viable to the on-line implementation of constrained DED due
   to substantial generator fuel cost savings and high speedup upper
   bounds. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Low-cost ceramic grid was used as a stand-alone focusing electrode in
   field emitter arrays to obtain high brightness and small electron beam
   size. Ceramic grid with an array of 200-mum holes was made from DuPont
   591 with low-cost equipment. Beam size is controllable by the voltage
   applied to the focusing grid. Light intensity profiles were measured and
   analyzed. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of light profile excited
   by electron emission from 30-mum wide field emitter arrays is 60 mum at
   5000 V with 6 mm anode-cathode separation. At an anode voltage of 2000 V
   and gate voltage of 55 V, focusing is optimized at a focusing voltage of
   30 V. Arc-free operation at 10 KV was achieved thereby promoting
   improved phosphor efficiency. This focus approach may lead to improve
   life of field emission display and other vacuum microelectronic devices
   by significantly increasing the total vacuum volume and providing a
   means for improved getter utilization.}},

Abstract = {{A novel AAC watermarking scheme with low structural and computational
   complexity is proposed to achieve real-time AAC audio watermark
   embedding capability. In this scheme, an enhanced spread spectrum
   watermarking method that increases the robustness and information hiding
   capacity of the watermarking channel is developed and employed.
   Furthermore, this scheme improves the speed of the encoding process in
   that we directly use the quantized indices rather than the dequantized
   coefficients, thus no explicit dequantization and requantization are
   performed. Our embedded watermark is tested to be robust against AAC/MP3
   transcoding at a rate of 10 bps. The scheme is suitable for speedy
   encoding and decoding of watermark with low cost hardware.}},

Abstract = {{A typical shadow-eliminating algorithm is presented in this paper.
   Algorithms for vehicle detection, edge detection and shadow detection
   are also given. If the shadow is not separated from the vehicle, the
   next traffic control processes, like vehicle classification, tracking
   and speed calculation, will be rather difficult. Our approach for shadow
   processing runs in real time in low-cost hardware. The knowledge, such
   as heading of roads, date and time, can be efficient used in the
   algorithm. First we detect moving vehicles in a sequence of image. In
   this way, we need not process the whole image, which saves computation
   time. Then we separate shades from vehicles using knowledge including
   results of edges detection, road direction, etc. The results of the
   algorithm are also given in the final of the paper, which shows that
   this algorithm is quite promising.}},

   two practical and well-known techniques for combating multipath ISI due

   equalization, which considers the characteristics of mobile
   communication channels. The performance of this new equalization method
   is compared to state-of-the-art equalizers by means of simulations. The
   complexity is evaluated by estimating the total computing expenditure.
   In addition a very efficient low-cost hardware structure for
   implementation is proposed. The algorithms are adapted for this hardware
   structure and the performance of this optimization is illustrated by
   simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this research was to study a system of acquisition and
   processing of images capable of confronting coloured wool with a
   reference specimen, in order to define the conformity using objective
   parameters. The first step of the research was to comprise and to
   analyze in depth the problem: there has been numerous implications of
   technical, physical, cultural, biological and also psychological
   character, that conic down from the attempt of giving a quantitative
   appraisal to the colour. In the scene of the national and international
   scientific and technological research, little has been made as regards
   measurement of colour through digital processing of the images through
   linear CCD. The reason is fundamentally of technological nature: only
   during the last years we found the presence on the market of low cost
   equipment capable of acquiring and processing images with adequate
   performances and qualities.
   The job described has permitted to create a first prototype of system
   for the colour measuring with use of CCD linear devices.
   Hardware identification to carry out a series of tests and experiments

Abstract = {{Wireless local area networks (WLANs) are becoming more popular with the
   availability of the IEEE802.11 standard and relatively low cost
   equipment which conform to it. Together with the deployment of next
   generation wireless networks are expected enable the users to be
   ``always-connected{''}. To exploit the benefits of being always
   connected, it will be necessary and desirable to provide location-based
   services to mitigate the differences in operating environment and to
   enhance the provided services. The provision of location based services
   is predicated upon the system being able to determine the location of
   the mobile devices. Current location determination schemes rely on
   additional hardware to establish the location. However these
   hardware-based schemes are expensive and difficult to configure. This
   paper presents a software based location management scheme which
   exploits the fact that indoor environments will have fixed devices at
   known locations, to achieve greater accuracy than any of the schemes
   that have been proposed to date. The viability and the accuracy of the
   system are demonstrated through a prototype implementation.}},

Abstract = {{In order to accommodate the predicted increase in screening required of
   successful pharmaceutical companies, miniaturized, high-speed HTS
   formats are necessary. Much emphasis has been placed on sensitive
   fluorescence techniques, but some systems, particularly enzymes
   interconverting small substrates, are likely to be refractory to such
   approaches. We show here that simple absorbance-based assays can be
   miniaturized to 10-mul volumes in 1536-well microplates compatible with
   the requirements for ultra-high throughput screening. We demonstrate
   that, with low-cost hardware, assay performance is wholly predictable
   from the 2-fold decrease in pathlength for fully filled 1536-well plates
   compared to 96- and 384-well microplates. A number of enzyme systems are
   shown to work in this high-density format, and the inhibition parameters
   determined are comparable with those in standard assay formats, We also
   demonstrate the utility of kinetics measurements in miniaturized format
   with improvements in assay quality and the ability to extract detailed
   mechanistic information about inhibitors.}},

Abstract = {{It has been recognized that analyzing at an early stage of the design
   the potential faulty behaviors of a circuit becomes a major concern due
   to the increasing probability of transient faults. It has been proposed
   to carry out such an analysis using fault injections in a hardware
   prototype of the circuit under design. This paper reports on a low cost
   environment using such a flow, A simple FPGA-based development board is
   used to emulate the circuit and the execution results are analysed on a
   PC computer. A generic, scalable. approach is proposed to overcome the
   limitations of such a simple set-tip. Such an environment can for
   example allow a designer to perform efficient and low cost dependability
   analyses for IP blocks.}},

Abstract = {{With a small, hand-held, palm-top receiver/LCD display, command and
   control, weather, hazard warnings, and common operational pictures may
   be conveniently presented and rapidly understood in context by deployed
   forces. Commercial information appliances based on palm-top products are
   in development, but military applications development lags, partly due
   to lack of a convenient delivery system.
   A major military problem continues to be the delivery, of information to
   lowest echelons ({''}the last mile{''}). Currently, GBS receive
   equipment (size, weight, and cost) is incompatible with application to
   lowest echelons. A low cost equipment solution is required and this is
   best accomplished by using lower frequencies, such as UHF, for data
   delivery. Fortunately, a UHF receiver on a 3 x 5 inch card is not only
   feasible, but has already been developed by SPAWAR. This is the ENTR.
   The concept of integrating ENTR with a palm-top display is suggested as
   a universal military product with numerous applications. For ubiquitous,
   Joint, global data delivery, a high power UHF satellite broadcast
   channel (EIRP >40 dBW) is suggested. The high power can support >64 kb/s
   delivery and data rate can be controlled to match G/T of addressed
   receivers, Such a channel is feasible for a GEO satellite such as the
   MUOS or the MEO GMSP (GPS replacement under study). Operational,
   schedule and cost advantages of the satellite broadcast channel and
   palm-top receiver-display are reviewed, including issues of technical
   feasibility and frequency management. Data would be broadcast without
   request, but return links for requesting data are briefly discussed.}},
