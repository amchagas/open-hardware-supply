abstract={The Stanford "Lab-In-A-Box" project comprises an open source hardware and software tool chain for teaching signal processing and analog electronics. It is intended to improve the teaching of these concepts by providing a platform that is more open and understandable and by lowering the economic barriers to students interested in the field. To do this, the Lab-In-A-Box brings a full powered Digital Signal Processor (DSP) core to the popular Arduino microcontroller environment and marries it with a simple to use analog front end (AFE). The software platform provided with the Lab-In-A-Box includes an Arduino-like development environment that facilitates learning and quick development of signal processing applications without abstracting away the intricacies of a practical implementation. This system has been used to create several teaching examples and has been tested in courses at Stanford University. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, an improved efficiency evaluation approach is proposed and described for a controlled Series Resonant Inverter for induction surface metal hardening using phase locked loop technique. This efficiency is assessed at the induction coil side, through the heat power being transferred to the work-piece, by monitoring the temperature evolution at the metal surface during the hardening process. In addition, its impact is examined by measurement of the hardness of the work-piece made out of 1038h (AISI/SAE). Further, an efficient digital control technique was designed, implemented and integrated into the induction heating system in the range of 1kW power range, at an operating frequency of 6.4 to 7.1 kHz. Its features are flexibility, low cost hardware, and higher response time. Also, the experimental results are presented to show the validity of the simulation model, and to evaluate the system performances. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Efficient parallel execution of scientific and transaction-oriented applications requires reducing communication/synchronization overheads by improving locality using explicit methods that capturet underlying access patterns. In this work, we propose low-cost hardware that supports load balancing and parallel broadcast/scatter macro-operations. We evaluate these primitives using a cycle-accurate SystemC virtual platform of a multicore System-on-Chip (SoC) that interconnects cycle-accurate processor models (Cortex-A9) and a memory hierarchy via a hypercube Network-on-Chip (NoC). Results from executing a typical parallel matrix multiplication benchmark on a small-range embedded multicore SoC, indicate average execution time improvements of 25% for load balancing, 21% for broadcast/scatter primitives and 50% collectively, when utilizing both primitives. While load balancing relies only on remote shared-memory access principles, synthesis on Zedboard's Zynq 7020 FPGA indicates a very low area cost for scatter operation compared to an industrial DMA-based scatter/gather solution. © 2015 Universita Politecnica dell Marche.},

abstract={Location-awareness is one of the major challenges in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) today. Received signal strength indicator (RSSI)-based localization techniques are a promising approach to provide location information in WSNs utilizing low-cost hardware. In this paper, the performance of RSSI-based direction-of-arrival (DOA) is assessed. Therefore, the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for direction estimation with RSSI measurements is derived in an analytical form. Furthermore, a position CRLB RSSI-based DOA estimates is presented. Since RSSI-based DOA is highly dependent on the direction of the received signal, and hence position estimates are, the network topology has a major impact on the feasible precision of the locating system. A methodology is shown to find the optimal WSN topology evaluating the position CRLB for RSSI-based DOA measurements. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={During a disaster, conventional communications infrastructures are often compromised, which prevents local populations from contacting family, friends, and colleagues. The lack of communication also impedes responder efforts to gather, organize, and disseminate information. This problem is made worse by the unique cost and operational constraints typically associated with the humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) space. In response, we present a low-cost, scalable system that creates a wide-area, best-effort, ad-hoc wireless network for emergency information. The Communication Assistance Technology over Ad-Hoc Networks (CATAN) system embraces the maker and do it yourself (DIY) communities by leveraging open-source and hobbyist technologies to create cheap, lightweight, battery-powered nodes that can be deployed quickly for a variety of operations. CATAN enables geographically separated users to share information on standard interfaces, i.e. web and SMS, over commonly-used communication interfaces, i.e. GSM and Wi-Fi. These interfaces enable CATAN to accommodate a variety of digital devices while leveraging the global ubiquity of cellular devices. By emphasizing simple, mature, technologies, CATAN avoids many problems that hinder many general purpose ad-hoc technologies. We have tested our infrastructure in a variety of environments and have open-sourced the entire project to encourage collaboration with the greater HADR community. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={To provide process optimization of metal fabricating self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) 3-D printers requires a low-cost sensor and data logger system to measure current (I) and voltage (V) of the gas metal arc welders (GMAW). This paper builds on previous open-source hardware development to provide a real-time measurement of welder I-V where the measuring circuit is connected to two analog inputs of the Arduino that is used to control the 3-D printer itself. Franklin firmware accessed through a web interface that is used to control the printer allows storing the measured values and downloading those stored readings to the user's computer. To test this custom current and voltage monitoring device this study reports on its use on an upgraded all metal RepRap during the printing of aluminum alloy (ER1100, ER4043, ER4943, ER4047, and ER5356). The voltage and current data were analyzed on a per alloy basis and also layer-by-layer in order to evaluate the device's efficacy as a monitoring device for 3-D printing and the results of the integrated design are discussed. © 2015 by the authors.},

abstract={One of the main limitations of imaging at high spatial and temporal resolution during in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments is the frame rate of the camera being used to image the dynamic process. While the recent development of direct detectors has provided the hardware to achieve frame rates approaching 0.1 ms, the cameras are expensive and must replace existing detectors. In this paper, we examine the use of coded aperture compressive sensing (CS) methods to increase the frame rate of any camera with simple, low-cost hardware modifications. The coded aperture approach allows multiple sub-frames to be coded and integrated into a single camera frame during the acquisition process, and then extracted upon readout using statistical CS inversion. Here we describe the background of CS and statistical methods in depth and simulate the frame rates and efficiencies for in-situ TEM experiments. Depending on the resolution and signal/noise of the image, it should be possible to increase the speed of any camera by more than an order of magnitude using this approach.

abstract={IN THE WAKE OF the Fukushima disaster in 2011, a lot of people in Japan felt the government was not giving them enough information about radiation, so many went out and bought their own Geiger counters. Supplies quickly ran dry, so a group gathered in Tokyo's Hackerspace to design and build their own under the name Safecast. Before they did anything, they consulted the Internet. Joichi Ito, director of the MIT Media Lab and founding member of Safecast, explained at the group's anniversary and conference in March this year: "When we had the earthquake, most of us didn't know about radiation or even starting up communities. We called out on the Internet, asking: 'Do you know anything about this?' Someone would say 'I know the person who did the monitoring sensors for Three Mile Island'. "We put together quite a good team having started from zero. We couldn't have designed this as quickly without open hardware or without the help of the Internet. That is a big trend that we are seeing the beginning of." The result of the hacking project was the bGeigie, a combination of a Geiger counter, GPS receiver and data recorder. Users submit their data to the Safecast database by uploading it from the bGeigie's SD card, usually from a network-enabled computer rather than the device itself. Ray Ozzie, former chief software architect of Microsoft and the adviser to Safecast, came up with the idea of putting the small initial number of handmade Geiger counters on the outside of car windows, so they could be driven round to maximise the number of readings around Japan that the team could record.},

abstract={The paper presents a new component for conventional video monitoring and security systems in air transportation, aiming at improving the overall system performance, eliminate nuisance alarms, optimize network bandwidth and systems storage occupation. Innovative analysis technologies were employed for the development of the new system. The proposed solution relies on a server application referred to as Third Party Core installed on a hardware platform residing in the same network with the video monitoring systems and other security systems. This server application uses data captured by video cameras, other security systems (e.g. access control, intrusion detection, radar surveillance) field equipment, data gathered and used in other server application (e.g. database servers, storage servers, other system servers) with to purpose of integrating different functionalities, unify the operator - machines interfaces, predict events, assist operators in video surveillance and improve the security of perimeter. The new server application can easily run on regular low cost hardware platforms (e.g. server or station available on the IT market) and was developed using SQL, C++ and languages connectors. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Looking for the green sources of energy have been the subject for research activities for last decade. For years studies have been using various kinds of energy sources to fulfill energy requirement. In order to reduce further accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs), green generator or converter of energy has been designed to replace the conventional (fossil) energy sources. A new technology had been developed that is known as Natural Dye Sensitized Solar Cells (NDSSC) which consists of a group of photovoltaic cells that produces green energy at low cost of sensitization material production since no vacuum systems or low cost equipment are usedin fabrication process. This paper reviews the structure and working principles of dye sensitized solar cell DSCC. Discussing preparation procedures, optical and electrical characterization of the types of natural dyes, namely, raspberry, blueberry, tumeric (curcuma longa), henna (lawsonia inermis), dragon fruit (hylocereuscostaricensis) and senduduk (melastoma malabathricum). Dye sensitized solar cell with dimension 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm is fabricated by using screen printing method with thickness 10μm of titanium dioxide (TiO2) by putting it on indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass. Then, the solar cell is tested under sunlight. Dye extracted from raspberry with TiO2 viscosity 1.0 g is the most desired natural dye within the selected range of natural dye, with a value of Isc (0.0367 mA), Voc (474mV), FF (0.818), Pmax (0.0000142) and η(0.0568). © 2006-2015 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

abstract={Coherent compounding method for plane-wave ultrasound imaging has been widely used in many frontier research areas. However, it still needs to find a compromise between the frame rate and image quality, which restricts its wider implementation. How to maintain the high frame rate and improve the image quality at the same time, has become a significant issue on plane-wave imaging technique. Although several methods based on compressive sensing (CS) have been proposed in previous studies, they still have some limitations, especially on the memory occupation and the amount of computation. In this paper, a novel CS-based beamforming method used for plane-wave ultrasound imaging is proposed and its image quality has been verified on several simulated phantoms. In this method, only the relationship between the time-delay information and the spatial distribution of the scatterers is considered when establishing the encoding matrix. In addition, the encoding matrix is expressed totally in time-domain with a dictionary-searching concept, and can be sparse-expressed with very low memory occupation. The imaging results have been compared with the traditional DAS method and the coherent compounding method. The image quality of CS method has been verified to be better than the traditional DAS method and even the coherent compounding method. The proposed method can be easily implemented on some low-cost hardware platforms, and can obtain ultrasound images with both high frame rate and good image quality, which make it has a great potential for clinical application. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Performance improvements of a single-core processor relying on high clock rates reached the limit. Instead of a single-core processor, multi-core and many-core processors have been mainstream to accelerate applications by parallel processing. Year by year, the number of cores integrated in a single chip has been increased due to improvements of semiconductor integration technologies depending on Moore's Law. On the other hand, Moore's Law will be ended in the near future. This means that the approaches relying on the increase in the number of cores will be hopeless, thus we have to consider other effective ways. One of them is to design application specific hardware. Several research organizations have explored it and reported its remarkable findings. We focus on such an acceleration approach with dedicated hardware. As a case study with dedicated hardware, we present a sorting acceleration method. Sorting is an extremely important computation kernel that should be accelerated in a lot of fields, such as databases, image processing, data compression, etc. We propose a sorting accelerator combining Sorting Network and Merge Sorter Tree, and detail the design and implementation. Our proposed sorting accelerator is customizable, thus designers can implement a sorting accelerator composed of required hardware resources by means of tuning design parameters. Our experiments show that the proposed hardware achieves up to 10.06x sorting performance, compared with Intel Core i7-4770 operating at 3.4GHz, when sorting 256M 32-bits integer elements. In order to allow every designer to easily and freely use this accelerator, the RTL source code is released as an open-source hardware. © 2015 IEEE.},

Such guidelines were followed for the realization of three prototypes obtained using rapid prototyping techniques, i.e., a 3D printer and an open hardware development platform. Both fully actuated and under-Actuated solutions have been explored. In the proposed wearable design, the robotic extra-finger can be worn as a bracelet in its rest position. The availability of a supplementary finger in the human hand allows to enlarge its workspace, improving grasping and manipulation capabilities.

abstract={During last years unmanned ground and aerial vehicles captured the attention of researchers and companies, while the available set of Unmanned Surface Vehicle platforms is smaller. In many scenarios an integrated approach is required considering a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles. In this paper we focus on the development of a low-cost unmanned surface platform for digital surveys. The boat has been designed to navigate also in shallow water owing to a low draft design. An embedded system with Robot Operating System (ROS) onboard has been deployed on the surface vehicle. One of the main advantages of the proposed solution is its reduced cost owing to open-hardware/software solutions. In particular, an open-hardware solution is responsible for the interfacing of an RTK GPS with a bathymetric ultrasound sensor to map the sea / lake / river floor. The boat can be either remotely controllable or fully autonomous. An Augmented Reality (AR) application has been also developed to show the path and the set of survey blocks that are mapped / not mapped. The AR application is particularly useful when the user remotely controls the boat, but also for supervising the autonomous survey. The performances achieved in the first trials are satisfactory and the AR application produces significant maps. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Nowadays, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) platform are widely employed in a broad range of applications: from environmental monitoring and precise agriculture to humanitarian localization and rescue and prevention of events such as floods, fires, landslides. On the other hand, Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) is an emerging technique which allows to monitor Earths surface parameters. Recently, this technique has been applied to soil moisture monitoring. In this paper, a prototype of a GNSS-based passive radar, able to exploit GNSS reflected signals from ground for soil moisture monitoring applications is presented. The prototype is able to handle signals coming from three antennas: one up-looking Right-Hand (RH) Circular Polarized antenna, for the direct signal from satellite, and two down-looking antennas, one RH and the other Left-Hand (LH) Circular Polarized, to measure the signals coming after reflection from ground. It is made of low-cost hardware and it is small and lightweight in order to be mounted on board an aircraft or a UAV. It basically serves as data grabber: The collected data are stored to memory for off-line processing. The design and development of the prototype is illustrated and early results of an in-field test campaign are also presented. © 2015 IEEE.},

The running plant temperatures are the fundamental parameter to evaluate the system performance such as proper operation, and the control and management system has to consider these parameters. A solar energy-powered wireless-based smart object was developed, able to monitor the running temperatures of a solar thermal system and aimed at moving beyond standard monitoring approaches to achieve a low-cost and customizable device, even in terms of installation in different environmental conditions. To this end, two types of communications were used: the first is a low-cost communication based on the ZigBee protocol used for control purposes, so that it can be customized according to specific needs, while the second is based on a Bluetooth protocol used for data display. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={In ultrafast ultrasound imaging technique, how to maintain the high frame rate, and at the same time to improve the image quality as far as possible, has become a significant issue. Several novel beamforming methods based on compressive sensing (CS) theory have been proposed in previous literatures, but all have their own limitations, such as the excessively large memory consumption and the errors caused by the short-time discrete Fourier transform (STDFT). In this study, a novel CS-based time-domain beamformer for plane-wave ultrasound imaging is proposed and its image quality has been verified to be better than the traditional DAS method and even the popular coherent compounding method on several simulated phantoms. Comparing to the existing CS method, the memory consumption of our method is significantly reduced since the encoding matrix can be sparse-expressed. In addition, the time-delay calculations of the echo signals are directly accomplished in time-domain with a dictionary concept, avoiding the errors induced by the short-time Fourier translation calculation in those frequency-domain methods. The proposed method can be easily implemented on some low-cost hardware platforms, and can obtain ultrasound images with both high frame rate and good image quality, which make it has a great potential for clinical application. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: The new technology ensures 3D laparoscopic vision by adding depth to the traditional two dimensions. This realistic vision gives the surgeon the feeling of operating in real space. Hospital of Treviglio-Caravaggio isn't an university or scientific institution; in 2014 a new 3D laparoscopic technology was acquired therefore it led to evaluation of the of the appropriateness in term of patient outcome and safety. The project aims at achieving the development of a quantitative validation model that would ensure low cost and a reliable measure of the performance of 3D technology versus 2D mode. In addition, it aims at demonstrating how new technologies, such as open source hardware and software and 3D printing, could help research with no significant cost increase. For these reasons, in order to define criteria of appropriateness in the use of 3D technologies, it was decided to perform a study to technically validate the use of the best technology in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and safety in the use of a system between laparoscopic vision in 3D and the traditional 2D. METHODS: 30 surgeons were enrolled in order to perform an exercise through the use of laparoscopic forceps inside a trainer. The exercise consisted of having surgeons with different level of seniority, grouped by type of specialization (eg. surgery, urology, gynecology), exercising videolaparoscopy with two technologies (2D and 3D) through the use of a anthropometric phantom. The target assigned to the surgeon was that to pass "needle and thread" without touching the metal part in the shortest time possible. The rings selected for the exercise had each a coefficient of difficulty determined by depth, diameter, angle from the positioning and from the point of view. RESULTS: The analysis of the data collected from the above exercise has mathematically confirmed that the 3D technique ensures a learning curve lower in novice and greater accuracy in the performance of the task with respect to 2D. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper intends to suggest a sensing circuit of PWM voltage for a motor emulator operated in the inverter. In the emulation of the motor using a power converter, it is necessary to measure instantaneous voltage at the PWM voltage loaded from the inverter. Using a filter can generate instantaneous voltage, while it is difficult to follow the rapidly changing inverter voltage caused by the propagation delay and signal attenuation. The method of measuring the duty of PWM using FPGA can generate output voltage from the one-cycle delay of PWM, while the cost of hardware is increasing in order to acquire high precision. This paper suggests a PWM voltage sensing circuit using the analogue system that shows high precision, one-cycle delay of PWM and low-cost hardware. The PWM voltage sensing circuit works in the process of integrating input voltage for valid time by comparing levels of three-phase PWM input voltage, and produce the output value integrated at zero vector. As a result of PSIM simulation and the experiment with the produced hardware, it was verified that the suggested circuit in this paper is valid. © Copyright The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers.},

The 32-bit EDAC circuit hardware implementation is selected to make a prototype, based on the 180 nm process. The delay penalties and area costs of the EDAC circuit are evaluated. Results show that the time penalty and area cost of the EDAC circuitries are affected with different parity-check matrices and different hardware implementation for the EDAC codes with the same capability of correction and detection code.

abstract={Embedded systems that are wirelessly reprogrammed can be rendered useless by certain programming errors, excessive power consumption, or misconfigurations in the hardware. These types of situations can leave a device in a state that compromises its programmability, often rendering the device useless. Existing attempts to address the problem of robust wireless reprogramming have all been software-based solutions, that are vulnerable to certain errors, such as memory corruption, can corrupt the recovery programs. We propose a hardware-based solution to wireless reprogramming, physically separating the programmer and target device. This separation limits the propagation of errors, and ensures the device will always be recoverable. In this poster we will present the design and an early prototype of our approach - an ultra-low-power, low-cost hardware solution to ensure recovery from fatal errors and reprogrammability in wireless systems. This poster discusses the current system design, initial results, and system analysis from our current prototype. We also present future and ongoing directions, as well as key research questions.

In this study, we have developed an electronic system based on the Arduino Open Hardware platform, to which we have added temperature and humidity sensors to adapt the system to the particular conditions of beehive management. The system has been used to record changes in temperature and humidity inside hives and assess bees' thermoregulation adaptability within colonies in hives with opened-screened bottom boards; an interesting management tool for controlling the harmful Varroa destructor mite as compared to beehives with conventional closed bottom boards. The results revealed that bee colonies were able to thermoregulate in hives with open anti-Varroa bottom boards to the same degree as those in conventional bottom board hives even under winter conditions in a mediterranean climate, thus indicating that there are no additional risks associated with the use of open-screened bottom board models. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Inclusive Education has been the agenda at all levels and modalities of the education system, which discusses how the school will face the diversity and teach students who have disabilities. According to the 2010 Census, in Brazil, people with physical disabilities account for almost 7% of the population. This project aims to design Digital Learning Constructs (DLC) as an inclusive education model implemented by use of Brain Computer Interface (BCI). Thus, it is intended to assist people with mobility limitations in the process of school inclusion. A DLC is any entity or device devised or built in a multidisciplinary way in the form of an educational game, helping players to build or redesign their knowledge. It has as features, dual nature, as an object of learning and also a game, working procedurally the contributions of each area without any subordination between them. Thus, via BCI, the user will not use mouse, but a specific low cost hardware, which will command the computer via brain waves. Future studies with the user will be conducted through a qualitative, quantitative and ergonomic design approach. The study subjects are people with motor and communication problems, of the municipal education network. The importance of studies linked to the autonomy of these subjects is due to the fact that many do not have freedom of movement, because of motor impairments. The aim of this project is to open paths for people with motor impairments and degenerative diseases, so they can use the computer in the classroom context. © 2015 ACM.},

The tests used natural emotional speech recordings representing 16 speakers expressing two emotions: anger and neutral (unemotional) state. The feature set was derived from the Teager energy operator (TEO) and the speech was classified using the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) method. The results showed that with decreasing fixed point resolution from 16 bits down to 6 bits, the average classification error for the TEO increases from 0.0% to 6.6%. At 8 bit resolution, the error was an acceptable 2.4%, which implies that the TEO can be efficiently calculated using low-cost hardware. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={The Android operating system is widely used on mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets. From the first Android devices to now, this operating system has improved its features and has been extended to new hardware. Because of its widespread use and the high number of low-cost hardware platforms on which it is available, there is a great interest in using it in areas such as automotive, industrial control or medical environments, where real-time requirements are imposed. This paper presents a solution that takes advantage of both, the fact that Android is based on the Linux kernel and that most of the newest Android devices use multicore processors. Thus, we have studied the mechanisms provided by the Linux kernel to isolate CPUs. The use of these mechanisms does not require profound changes in Android, only configuration adjustments. In addition, we have determined that using appropriate isolation mechanisms, Android can be used for soft real-time purposes. Since our solution does not require major modifications of the operating system it is very portable among all kinds of devices. © 2015 ACM.},

abstract={Competitive solutions to the growing demand for home automation will most likely include the use of low cost components, open source and open hardware. Using the ZigBee protocol, a low cost lighting control actuator was developed that was battery efficient and easy to use in a home automation system environment. Raspberry Pi was used to house a Web server, which provided the user an adaptive web application to access the lighting actuator control. XBee modules were chosen for their small size, low energy consumption and the large amount of documentation that exists in regard to its use. Considering the worst-case scenario, the lighting control actuator was designed so if its battery runs out of power or the ZigBee network fails, it can work as a normal light switch. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurological disorder after Alzheimer's disease. Key clinical features of PD are motor-related and are typically assessed by healthcare providers based on qualitative visual inspection of a patient's movement/gait/posture. More advanced diagnostic techniques such as computed tomography scans that measure brain function, can be cost prohibitive and may expose patients to radiation and other harmful effects. To mitigate these challenges, and open a pathway to remote patient-physician assessment, the authors of this work propose a data mining–driven methodology that uses low cost, non-invasive sensors to model and predict the presence (or lack therefore) of PD movement abnormalities and model clinical subtypes. The study presented here evaluates the discriminative ability of non-invasive hardware and data mining algorithms to classify PD cases and controls. A 10-fold cross-validation approach is used to compare several data mining algorithms in order to determine that which provides the most consistent results when varying the subject gait data. Next, the predictive accuracy of the data mining model is quantified by testing it against unseen data captured from a test pool of subjects. The proposed methodology demonstrates the feasibility of using non-invasive, low cost, hardware and data mining models to monitor the progression of gait features outside of the traditional healthcare facility, which may ultimately lead to earlier diagnosis of emerging neurological diseases. © 2015, “II“.},

abstract={Target detection is an important issue in the unattended ground sensors. In this paper, inspired by the idea of subspace-based direction of arrival estimation algorithms, a new target detection algorithm called subspace-based target detection (SBTD) is proposed to detect moving targets. The SBTD employs the SNR of the acoustic signals to decide whether moving targets are exiting or not. Although the SBTD has good detection performance, its cost maybe a little high for unattended sensors with low-cost hardware and long-term monitoring. To relieve the cost, we propose the hierarchical detection scheme and develop a two-stage detection method based on the SBTD for target detection in the wild, in which the first stage detection algorithm is chosen from current detection algorithms, while the second stage detection algorithm employs the SBTD. Experiments are conducted to verify the proposed detection method through acoustic signals gathered by the micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) microphone array in the wild. Results show that the detector constructed by our two-stage detection method cannot only estimate the SNR of the acoustic signals but also can reduce the false alarm rate significantly with the detection rate almost unchanged in comparison with the detector chosen by its first-stage detection algorithm. The results indicate that a better detection performance is achieved in terms of the receiver operator characteristic curves. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={A long endurance high efficiency Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is being developed by a group of researchers and students in the Mechanical Engineering Technology program at Algonquin College, Ottawa, ON, Canada. The design is based on a tailless, staggered tandem wing configuration, with a carbon fiber frame and electric propulsion. The developed aircraft has a maximum weight of 12.5 kg, well within the 25 kg limit outlined by Transport Canada for permission-free operation. The UAV was designed to fly missions exceeding 24 hours, performing surveillance and oil pipeline monitoring and inspection, either autonomously or under radio control from a ground station, with medium to high payload capacity. This paper describes the process of designing, manufacturing and testing the developed configuration. The operational requirements are delineated as conceptualized by the development team. A description of the prototype development, including aerodynamics, structural and stability performance, and stability derivatives is included, based on data generated through analytical analysis, simulations in the aerodynamics and stability design software, XFLR5, and testing. The configuration was developed and modeled in the software package SolidWorks, leading to the manufacturing plans for the prototype. As this UAV performs radio controlled and autonomous flights, it makes use of the APM Arduplane, which is an open source hardware and software autopilot package. In order to achieve PID tuning, Hardware in the Loop (HIL) simulations were performed between the autopilot board and two computers simultaneously running the Mission Planner software and the flight simulator X-Plane 10 software. A description of this tuning process is provided. The paper concludes with the results of performed flight tests, documenting performance achievements, and an outline of recommendations for further development. Copyright © 2015 SAE International.},

abstract={From the rising number of hackerspaces to an increase in hardware start-ups, maker culture is envisioned as an enabler of the next industrial revolution—a source of unhindered technological innovation, a revamp of broken economies and educational systems. Drawing from long-term ethnographic research, this article examines how China’s makers demarcate Chinese manufacturing as a site of expertise in implementing this vision. China’s makers demonstrate that the future of making—if to materialize in the ways currently envisioned by writers, politicians, and scholars of the global tech industry—rests on taking seriously the technological and cultural fabrics of professional making outside familiar information technology innovation hubs like Silicon Valley: making-do, mass production, and reuse. I trace back to China’s first hackerspace, documenting how a collective of makers began to move away from appropriating Western concepts of openness toward promoting China as source for knowledge, creativity, and innovation. This article demonstrates that when China’s makers set up open hardware businesses and articulate a unique culture of “hacking with Chinese characteristics,” they draw boundaries between the professional making they saw embodied in Chinese industrial production and the hobbyist making embodied in Western histories and cultures of hacking. In so doing, they position China as site of both technological and cultural expertise, intervening in dominant conceptions of computing that split manufacturing and innovation along geographical lines. This article contributes to critical scholarship of innovation and making cultures, technological expertise, and authorship. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.},

abstract={The increasing availability of low-cost hardware along with the rapid growth of wireless devices has enabled the development of Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSNs). Multimedia content such as video and audio streaming is transmitted over a WMSN which can easily be deployed with low cost. However, enabling real-time data applications in those networks demands not only Quality of Service (QoS) awareness, but also efficient energy management. Sensor network devices have limited energy resources. The limited energy poses significant threats on the QoS of WMSNs. In this paper, to improve the efficiency of QoS-aware routing, we examine an angle-based QoS and energy-aware dynamic routing scheme designed for WMSNs. The proposed approach uses the inclination angle and the transmission distance between nodes to optimize the selection of the forwarding candidate set and extend network lifetime. Simulation results indicate that considerable lifetime values can be achieved. © 2015 IEEE.},

Making heavy use of consumer-grade parts and a custom software stack, the system was developed at a small fraction of the cost of comparable installations. Unlike existing GPU backends, this system is built around OpenCL kernels running on consumer-level AMD GPUs, taking advantage of low-cost hardware and leveraging packed integer operations to double algorithmic efficiency.

abstract={Precision agriculture combines the use of information and technology to ensure the best agricultural practices. Obtaining real-time non-invasive information to monitor crops or make yield predictions is a challenge. An approach is to use crop yield models in combination with real-time data used as input in such models. It was demonstrated that it is possible to design an accurate system using open source hardware and open systems to record the input for these models and monitor crops. The system presented has two main components: a device that records environmental parameters and a smartphone application (software) that links this device to a data server in order to process and analyse the information. The solution is scalable in terms of the type of sensors used (i.e. temperature and relative humidity of the air or soil), the rate of information retrieval and so on, so it can be used in various scenarios, including environmental or land policy monitoring. Moreover, this open source hardware can be used by a broad variety of users and is an alternative in poor rural areas because of its low cost compared to other solutions. It can enable increased agricultural production and management of the local environment, bringing new agricultural practices to these areas. Furthermore, progress in the use of this type of technology can help to develop new capabilities for growers. Results of calibration tests and measurements to demonstrate the usefulness of this system in precision agriculture are presented. © 2015 IAgrE.},

abstract={A plenitude of technology is neither developed in-house nor simply outsourced in dyadic relationships. Instead, we are in a new age where technologies are developed by a networked community of actors and organizations, which base their relations dynamically to each other on a common interest. Such dynamic and networked complexity of technology development is often theoretical explored around the concept of platform, and more recently by employing the concept of ecosystem in an analogy to natural ecosystems. Following the success of open-source software, academics have long been examining openness in digital platforms/ecosystems; however most contributions take the perspective of a single stakeholder from the many that constitute a digital platform/ecosystem. Predominantly, they take the sole perspective of platform providers, those bundling hardware and software or more rarely, the perspective of third-party software developers developing valuable software 'apps' that add value to the overall platform. In this conceptual article, we grasp openness more holistically, both by acknowledging that openness means different things to different people and involve all stakeholders within the platforms/ecosystems. Towards the development of a theory of openness within digital settings, we propose six novel aspects of openness for enabling a greater understanding of the open-source software movement with a digital platforms/ecosystems perspective. Moreover, we invite scholars to reconsider the more predominating product-dominant logic in open-source software research to a more holistic logic embracing platforms and ecosystem thinking.},

abstract={In this paper is presented approach in planning the deployment of 868 MHz RF modules in Wireless Sensor Networks scenarios. This approach covers the site-general ITU propagation model calculation compared with the real field measurement made with open-source hardware platform based on Arduino UNO and RFBee communication modules. The field measurements are made in institutional building in order to find effective way to predict best positions for wireless sensor stations in Wireless Sensor Network. The Arduino is used to make effective and low-cost platform for experiments. The RF 868 MHz modules are used in order to avoid 2.4 GHz frequency range with lot of interference. In this paper is presented the platform, test conditions, measurement results and the discussion about the achieved results with focus on the tuning of the ITU loss propagation model for the best planning of node deployment in the given scenario. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Inverted pendulum is a highly non-linear system, which makes it a complex control problem that may be articulated for various real-life applications. Usually, its linearized model is implemented and controlled using a typical Proportional-Integral-Derivate (PID) controller but a different controller is required to control the actual, non-linear model. In the current work, we aim to develop an indigenous and experimental hardware platform to implement conventional PID, Fuzzy and Hybrid techniques. Hardware setup of this model is implemented on a 4-wheeler mobile cart with an inverted rod mechanism (pendulum). Control circuit is implemented through Arduino and associated control circuitry. The controller is simulated on MATLAB/Simulink and implemented on this hardware platform to validate minimum possible deflection of pendulum from a reference vertical position using PID, Fuzzy and hybrid control schemes. Results are promising from an FLC scheme applied on the close to real non-linear model of the system. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={This study provides an in-depth investigation into low-cost and no-cost substrate release mechanisms that allow gas metal arc weld 3-D printed ER4043 aluminum and ER70S-6 steel parts to be removed from a reusable print substrate with minimal energy. Aluminum oxide, boron nitride, and titanium nitride coatings were evaluated as possible substrate release agents for aluminum printing. Additionally, the in situ formation of substrate release agents such as intermetallics and oxides were tested for both aluminum and steel printing. Testing was performed with a modified Charpy impact tester to remove 3-D printed metal parts from an 1100 aluminum or A36 low carbon steel print substrate to assess the impact energy required for removal. Specimen porosity was measured prior to sectioning and microstructural analysis, hardness traverses were measured across the specimens, and the elastic and shear moduli of the parts were analyzed via ultrasonic methods. All of the employed substrate release mechanisms minimized weld penetration and, in some instances, formed a brittle phase with the print substrate that allowed the specimens to be removed with minimal impact energy. These results thus provide methods with the removal of metal 3-D printed parts from print substrates with no specialized tooling or equipment conducive to distributed manufacturing. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={This paper describes the design of a portable carbon dioxide detector from low cost hardware and software components. The carbon dioxide molecules absorb light at a specific wavelength of 4.26 μm in the mid-infrared radiation. High concentrations of carbon dioxide molecules absorb more IR light than low concentrations. The design of the system includes a monochromatic infrared source, located in the source housing, and is activated by a constant voltage source obtained from the Switching Regulator Assembly. The infrared energy entering the sample chamber is absorbed at the wavelength specified as a result of the concentration of carbon dioxide being measured. The reflector assembly at the rear of the sample chamber returns the energy onto the IR detector. The detector signal is amplified by a low noise pre-amplifier and directed to the microprocessor. The signal goes into the processor through an ADC circuit. The amplitude of the digital signal is then threshold detected at a predetermined value to detect the amount of carbon dioxide. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={We present a novel approach to developing a vehicle communication platform consisting of a low-cost, open-source hardware for moving vehicle data to a secure server, a Web Application Programming Interface (API) for the provision of third-party services, and an intuitive user dashboard for access control and service distribution. The CloudThink infrastructure promotes the commoditization of vehicle telematics data by facilitating easier, flexible, and more secure access. It enables drivers to confidently share their vehicle information across multiple applications to improve the transportation experience for all stakeholders, as well as to potentially monetize their data. The foundations for an application ecosystem have been developed which, taken together with the fair value for driving data and low barriers to entry, will drive adoption of CloudThink as the standard method for projecting physical vehicles into the cloud. The application space initially consists of a few fundamental and important applications (vehicle tethering and remote diagnostics, road-safety monitoring, and fuel economy analysis) but as CloudThink begins to gain widespread adoption, the multiplexing of applications on the same data structure and set will accelerate its adoption. © 2015 © 2015 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press.},

Sometimes they could consume coding gains we acquired laboriously. In this paper, we explain the phenomenon that pursuing high information content blindly will reduce network performance, and we prove the constant incorrect ratio in neighbor state learning model mathematically. Then, we analyze the rela- tionship between trafic load and buffer occupancy of COPE through simulations.

abstract={Sustainability has become a major concern in many countries and is leading to strict regulations regarding the impact of products and services during their manufacturing, use, and disposal. Power consumption monitoring in manufacturing companies can lead to a reduction of machine tools energy wastes and consequently to lower expenses. To this end, a complete transparency of energy usage among the entire manufacturing facilities is required. Despite the small volume of material processed, micro manufacturing processes are energy intensive and the optimization of energy usage becomes critical for manufacturing sustainability. Electrical discharge machining (EDM) is considered an attractive solution for the manufacturing of microcomponents. In this paper, a low cost and modular data acquisition system, based on open-hardware and open-source software, for online energy consumption monitoring, is presented. The system described is applied for energy efficiency analysis of the micro EDM milling process by using a state of the art commercial machine tool. A number of sensors is connected to the data acquisition system to measure the energy consumption of the main sub-systems of the machine tool, data is recorded through a microcontroller, and sent to the main computer via Wi-Fi for data storage and analysis. Results show that the process efficiency depends on machine parameters but it is always far below 0.01 %. Solutions are suggested to improve the energy efficiency of the machine tool considered in this work. © 2015, Springer-Verlag London.},

abstract={The Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) refers to the quality of the environment in relation to the health and well-being of the occupants. It is a holistic concept, which considers several categories, each related to a specific environmental parameter. This article describes a low-cost and open-source hardware architecture able to detect the indoor variables necessary for the IEQ calculation as an alternative to the traditional hardware used for this purpose. The system consists of some sensors and an Arduino board. One of the key strengths of Arduino is the possibility it affords of loading the script into the board’s memory and letting it run without interfacing with computers, thus granting complete independence, portability and accuracy. Recent works have demonstrated that the cost of scientific equipment can be reduced by applying open-source principles to their design using a combination of the Arduino platform and a 3D printer. The evolution of the 3D printer has provided a new means of open design capable of accelerating self-directed development. The proposed nano Environmental Monitoring System (nEMoS) instrument is shown to have good reliability and it provides the foundation for a more critical approach to the use of professional sensors as well as for conceiving new scenarios and potential applications. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={One often-overlooked factor when selecting a platform for large-scale electrophysiology is whether or not a particular data acquisition system is 'open' or 'closed': that is, whether or not the system's schematics and source code are available to end users. Open systems have a reputation for being difficult to acquire, poorly documented, and hard to maintain. With the arrival of more powerful and compact integrated circuits, rapid prototyping services, and web-based tools for collaborative development, these stereotypes must be reconsidered. We discuss some of the reasons why multichannel extracellular electrophysiology could benefit from open-source approaches and describe examples of successful community-driven tool development within this field. In order to promote the adoption of open-source hardware and to reduce the need for redundant development efforts, we advocate a move toward standardized interfaces that connect each element of the data processing pipeline. This will give researchers the flexibility to modify their tools when necessary, while allowing them to continue to benefit from the high-quality products and expertise provided by commercial vendors. © 2014.},

abstract={Recent neurophysiologic findings have shown that astrocytes play important roles in information processing and modulation of neuronal activity. Motivated by these findings, in the present research, a digital neuromorphic circuit to study neuron-astrocyte interaction is proposed. In this digital circuit, the firing dynamics of the neuron is described by Izhikevich model and the calcium dynamics of a single astrocyte is explained by a functional model introduced by Postnov and colleagues. For digital implementation of the neuron-astrocyte signaling, Single Constant Multiply (SCM) technique and several linear approximations are used for efficient low-cost hardware implementation on digital platforms. Using the proposed neuron-astrocyte circuit and based on the results of MATLAB simulations, hardware synthesis and FPGA implementation, it is demonstrated that the proposed digital astrocyte is able to change the firing patterns of the neuron through bidirectional communication. Utilizing the proposed digital circuit, it will be illustrated that information processing in synaptic clefts is strongly regulated by astrocyte. Moreover, our results suggest that the digital circuit of neuron-astrocyte crosstalk produces diverse neural responses and therefore enhances the information processing capabilities of the neuromorphic circuits. This is suitable for applications in reconfigurable neuromorphic devices which implement biologically brain circuits. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Objective: 3-D printing technologies have the potential to improve both Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education and Career and Technical Education (CTE), as well as integrating these two educational emphases and providing opportunities for cross-curriculum engagement. The objective of this study is to investigate the potential of open-source (OS) technologies in an educational setting, given the combination of economic constraints affecting all educational environments and the ability of OS design to profoundly decrease the cost of technological tools and technological innovation. Methods: This paper reports on a 3-day workshop augmented with online instructional and visual tools designed for middle school and high school level educators from a wide array of disciplines (including traditional science, math, and engineering as well as computer, shop, and art). Teachers (n=22) submitted applications to participate in the workshop, the workshop was observed for both evaluation and research, teachers participated in focus groups (n=2) during the workshop in order to discuss their interest in OS 3-D printing technology and its potential role in their classrooms, and teachers completed a voluntary post-workshop survey and responded to follow-up after printers were in the classroom for one year. Results: During the workshop teachers built 3-D printers using OS technologies that they were then able to take back to their schools and into their classrooms. Conclusion: Through workshops augmented with online instructional and visual tools designed to provide facilitated yet self-directed engagement with a new, relatively unknown, and relatively complex technology, paired teacher teams were able to successfully build and use RepRap 3-D printers based on OS design in just three days. Practice: Here, we discuss both what the teachers learned and what we learned from the teachers regarding the potential for educators to construct OS 3-D printing technologies as a tool of empowering and transformative education. Implications: Open-source 3-D printing technologies have the potential to improve education through a sense of empowerment resulting from active participation, as well as through cross-curriculum engagement. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The new open-source quadrotor platform called X4-MaG presented here was developed for academic and research applications. X4-MaG is a small, low-cost open quadrotor of only 307-grammes which offers two levels of controllers providing a manual mode and an automatic mode thanks to powerful Linux-based controller embedded onboard. The experiments presented here show the reliability of the open hardware and software embedded onboard the quadrotor. To estimate the robot s attitude, a quaternion-based complementary filter requiring very few computational resources was developed and implemented on an 8-bit Arduino board. It was also established that the stabilization feedback system based on quaternions tracks the attitude setpoints with precision up to twice greater than a classical cascaded PI controller. The controllers and estimators were designed in the Matlab/Simulink environment and directly implemented onboard the tiny Linux-based autopilot board using a custom made toolbox (RT-MaG toolbox). The autopilot was tested in the brand-new Marseilles Flying Arena with various 3-D flight trajectories and found to be highly accurate with errors of only 0.7cm in hover and less than 3.2cm at 1.2m.s-1. The X4-MaG quadrotor was able to reach speeds greater than 2m.s-1 and reject attitude disturbances of 20′ within 0.8s.},

abstract={Microtremor survey is a kind of passive-source methods which uses ambient ground tremors for geological investigation. Compared with traditional geophysical methods, it is more flexible, cost-efficient, and environmentally friendly. Most currently used geophones are expensive and bulky, and therefore inconvenient to large-scale deployment. In this study, a no-cable low-cost geophone was optimized to suit for large-scale microtremor survey. The method of optimization is based on the following four points: First, it selects a sensor through the analysis of the self-noise of to meet the needs of microtremor survey. Second,it chooses the right operational amplifier and AD conversion module. Third, it integrates design of the entire system without using external module.And fourth,it makes a low-cost design of the geophone system, including selection of low-cost hardware components and reducing the amount of software code. Finally, the optimized geophone was used in three areas with different geological conditions in order to verify the rationality of the improvement and the possibilities for large-scale microtremor survey. The purpose of optimization has been achieved in this research. The no-cable geophone wrights only 600 g, and the maximum average power cost does not exceed 0.1 mW. The entire system costs less than 2000 RMB. The most important thing is the optimized geophone can record the microtremor signal from 0.5 to 20 Hz effectively. Experiments show that in different geological conditions the geophone can be setup quickly and work smoothly and reliably. The results of microtremor survey experiments are consistent with the existing geological data. Because the new geophone is much cheaper than the existing microtremor survey equipment, it is possible to use it in low-cost large-scale survey. The optimized geophone has a very small volume and light weight, and can be rapidly emplacedinto a variety of detector arrays. After the emplacement of large number of geophones, it can easily and quickly conduct survey to two-dimensional or three-dimensional velocity structure of the area. Such microtremor survey with environment-friendly and low-cost advantages has broad application prospects. ©, 2015, Science Press. All right reserved.},

abstract={The Global Food Safety Partnership (GFSP) is a public/private partnership established through the World Bank to improve food safety systems through a globally coordinated and locally-driven approach. This concept paper aims to establish a framework to help GFSP fully leverage the potential of open models. In preparing this paper the authors spoke to many different GFSP stakeholders who asked questions about open models such as: what is it? what's in it for me? why use an open rather than a proprietary model? how will open models generate equivalent or greater sustainable revenue streams compared to the current "traditional? approaches? This last question came up many times with assertions that traditional service providers need to see opportunity for equivalent or greater revenue dollars before they will buy-in. This paper identifies open value propositions for GFSP stakeholders and proposes a framework for creating and structuring that value. Open Educational Resources (OER) were the primary open practice GFSP partners spoke to us about, as they provide a logical entry point for collaboration. Going forward, funders should consider requiring that educational resources and concomitant data resulting from their sponsorship should be open, as a public good. There are, however, many other forms of open practice that bring value to the GFSP. Nine different open strategies and tactics (Appendix A) are described, including: open content (including OER and open courseware), open data, open access (research), open government, open source software, open standards, open policy, open licensing and open hardware. It is recommended that all stakeholders proactively pursue "openness" as an operating principle. This paper presents an overall GFSP Open Ecosystem Engagement Strategy within which specific local case examples can be situated. Two different case examples, China and Colombia, are presented to show both project-based and crowd-sourced, direct-to-public paths through this ecosystem. © 2015 Stacey P et al.},

abstract={The continuing trend of miniaturization of products, devices, and equipment has been a major driver to the development of micro- and nano-manufacturing technology. Compared to the development of 10. years ago, which saw micro-manufacturing research focused significantly on fundamental issues concerning the scaling down of conventional processes and equipment, recent development has been largely applications-driven. This overview initially looks at market needs and sector-driven applications, followed by examining the challenges to micro-manufacturing in order for it to be able to meet these needs/applications. This is then followed by reviewing the latest developments of the methods, processes, and equipment of micro-manufacturing and by examination of some of the associated issues such as design considerations, material factors, and technology utilization strategy, etc. It is found that during the last 10. years, the number of manufacturing processes investigated has increased significantly; manufacturing processes such as micro-machining, laser machining, micro-EDM, micro-electrochemical machining, hot embossing, micro-powder injection molding, photoelectroforming, etc., have been mature areas for application; significant research and technological development (RTD) effort has been shifted to the transforming of laboratory processes into items of production equipment; and the development has been targeting onto sector-specific applications. Considering that micro-manufacturing bridges between potential, high-impact nano-science and nano-technology and real-life, low-cost products, it will achieve further significant development over the next 10. years. In addition to the needs of significant effort in developing low-cost equipment, other aspects such as advanced tools and analysis, software as well as high-quality materials, handling, inspection, standardization, quality assurance, manufacturing cost, etc., need to be paid attention to. © 2015 Yi Qin Published by Elsevier Inc.

abstract={This paper introduces a new data-driven bottom-up monitoring approach for distribution systems. In this approach, local estimations of the subsections into which the system is split are performed independently, thus leading to a scalable architecture. The monitoring approach is focused only on the estimation of voltage magnitude rather than the complete state of the system. This reduces the measurement requirements significantly, thus addressing economical and technical concerns for existing systems, while staying open to accommodating further incremental improvements in the available data and data quality. The estimation of each section is realized via an artificial neural network (ANN), for which a set of parameterizations is available to cope with different operating conditions. The estimation convergence is achieved even with relatively few measurements, although accuracy varies depending on the available measurements. At the Medium Voltage (MV) level, where reconfiguration is common, a configuration identification unit chooses the right ANN, the one trained for the actual network configuration. The estimation process is computationally simple and can be executed on low-cost hardware, as demonstrated in this paper by the implementation on a BeagleBone Black board. To demonstrate the concept, a prototype and a laboratory setup have been developed. The experimental test results are presented both for an Low Voltage distribution system and an MV distribution system. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The emerging need to make more attractive physical stores for catching new clients and maintaining the existing ones pushes retailers to develop efficient practices for acquiring knowledge from consumers and involving them in the points of sales' design. The final users' needs and preferences are considered a core in design process. This chapter proposes a system for involving consumers in the store design process through an innovative cloud participatory platform. It is a low cost hardware/software architecture offering a user-friendly interface able to be adopted by audiences with different background. Results show the consumers' interest to contribute in the design by using such technologies and providing a large amount of detailed information useful for future appealing stores' development. Finally, this chapter shows how the inclusion of modern low-cost game technologies in retail industry might provide ripper effects in several disciplines such as human-computer interaction, marketing, and management. © 2015 by IGI Global.

abstract={Conventional deep brain stimulation (DBS) applies constant electrical stimulation to specific brain regions to treat neurological disorders. Closed-loop DBS with real-time feedback is gaining attention in recent years, after proved more effective than conventional DBS in terms of pathological symptom control clinically. Here we demonstrate the conceptualization and validation of a closed-loop DBS system using open-source hardware. We used hippocampal theta oscillations as system input, and electrical stimulation in the mesencephalic reticular formation (mRt) as controller output. It is well documented that hippocampal theta oscillations are highly related to locomotion, while electrical stimulation in the mRt induces freezing. We used an Arduino open-source microcontroller between input and output sources. This allowed us to use hippocampal local field potentials (LFPs) to steer electrical stimulation in the mRt. Our results showed that closed-loop DBS significantly suppressed locomotion compared to no stimulation, and required on average only 56% of the stimulation used in open-loop DBS to reach similar effects. The main advantages of open-source hardware include wide selection and availability, high customizability, and affordability. Our open-source closed-loop DBS system is effective, and warrants further research using open-source hardware for closed-loop neuromodulation.},

abstract={Companies that produce open-source hardware are few and far between. At least, they are if you define them in the usual way: an enterprise that provides documentation and permission sufficient for others to re-create, modify, improve, and even make their own versions of the devices it sells. And although open hardware has made strides in recent years-including an increasing number of companies adhering to these practices along with the establishment of the Open Source Hardware Association-it remains a niche industry. You might guess the reason to be simple-such companies must be set up and run by idealists who lack any hardheaded business sense. Not true! What's held back the opensource hardware movement is not a lack of business acumen; it's the rapid evolution of electronic technology. The reasons for this are subtle, but as I will explain below, swift advances in electronic technology inherently favor large closed businesses at the expense of small teams or individual innovators, who benefit most by working with open systems. At least that's the way things have been. But there are changes coming that I expect will tilt the balance the other way. © 1964-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) exists ubiquitously in our daily lives. It is usually achieved by using a physical controller such as a mouse, keyboard or touch screen. It hinders Natural User Interface (NUI) as there is a strong barrier between the user and computer. There are various hand tracking systems available on the market, but they are complex and expensive. In this paper, we present the design and development of a robust marker-less hand/finger tracking and gesture recognition system using low-cost hardware. We propose a simple but efficient method that allows robust and fast hand tracking despite complex background and motion blur. Our system is able to translate the detected hands or gestures into different functional inputs and interfaces with other applications via several methods. It enables intuitive HCI and interactive motion gaming. We also developed sample applications that can utilize the inputs from the hand tracking system. Our results show that an intuitive HCI and motion gaming system can be achieved with minimum hardware requirements. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={The burning of solid fuels for cooking creates significant adverse health, social, and economic consequences for more than three billion people worldwide. Recognizing this issue, many groups have worked to develop improved stoves that increase fuel efficiency, decrease fuel use, and reduce particulate emissions. Less attention has been given to developing a standardized process for rating cookstove safety and reducing cookstove hazards. This paper identifies common cooking hazards and seeks to reduce cooking injuries by proposing ten field-based safety guidelines for solid fuel stoves. Each guideline describes an underlying safety principle and is accompanied by a test protocol and a metric to rate stove safety. This incremental rating system enables stove designers, donors, and consumers to track and promote stepwise safety improvements. The protocols use low-cost equipment to allow the many manufacturers of handcrafted cookstoves to assess safety without using sophisticated testing facilities and expensive equipment. © 2015 International Energy Initiative.},

abstract={For real-time surveillance and safety applications in intelligent transportation systems, high-speed processing for image enhancement is necessary and must be considered. In this paper, we propose a fast and efficient illumination adjustment algorithm that is suitable for low-cost very large scale integration implementation. Experimental results show that the proposed method requires the least number of operations and achieves comparable visual quality as compared with previous techniques. To further meet the requirement of real-time image/video applications, the 16-stage pipelined hardware architecture of our method is implemented as an intellectual property core. Our design yields a processing rate of about 200 MHz by using TSMC 0.13-μm technology. Since it can process one pixel per clock cycle, for an image with a resolution of QSXGA (2560 × 2048) , it requires about 27 ms to process one frame that is suitable for real-time applications. In some low-cost intelligent imaging systems, the processing rate can be slowed down, and our hardware core can run at very low power consumption. © 2000-2011 IEEE.},

In both cases, a main concern in the development has been to keep low the overall complexity, so that the hosting hardware that executes the proposed methods is left with free resources, in order to be able to also execute other processes in the context of a health monitoring framework. In addition, all experiments have been carried out using typical, lowcost visual sensors, i.e. simple webcams.

abstract={The concept of the Internet of Things is rapidly becoming a reality, with many applications being deployed within industrial and consumer sectors. At the ‘thing’ level—devices and inter-device network communication—the core technical building blocks are generally the same as those found in wireless sensor network implementations. For the Internet of Things to continue growing, we need more plentiful resources for building intelligent devices and sensor networks. Unfortunately, current commercial devices, e.g., sensor nodes and network gateways, tend to be expensive and proprietary, which presents a barrier to entry and arguably slows down further development. There are, however, an increasing number of open embedded platforms available and also a wide selection of off-the-shelf components that can quickly and easily be built into device and network gateway solutions. The question is whether these solutions measure up to built-for-purpose devices. In the paper, we provide a comparison of existing built-for-purpose devices against open source devices. For comparison, we have also designed and rapidly prototyped a sensor node based on off-the-shelf components. We show that these devices compare favorably to built-for-purpose devices in terms of performance, power and cost. Using open platforms and off-the-shelf components would allow more developers to build intelligent devices and sensor networks, which could result in a better overall development ecosystem, lower barriers to entry and rapid growth in the number of IoT applications. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={In this paper, we show that magnetic nanowires with weak magnetic fields and low frequencies can induce cell death via a mechanism that does not involve heat production. We incubated colon cancer cells with two concentrations (2.4 and 12 μg/mL) of nickel nanowires that were 35 nm in diameter and exposed the cells and nanowires to an alternating magnetic field (0.5 mT and 1 Hz or 1 kHz) for 10 or 30 minutes. This low-power field exerted a force on the magnetic nanowires, causing a mechanical disturbance to the cells. Transmission electron microscopy images showed that the nanostructures were internalized into the cells within 1 hour of incubation. Cell viability studies showed that the magnetic field and the nanowires separately had minor deleterious effects on the cells; however, when combined, the magnetic field and nanowires caused the cell viability values to drop by up to 39%, depending on the strength of the magnetic field and the concentration of the nanowires. Cell membrane leakage experiments indicated membrane leakage of 20%, suggesting that cell death mechanisms induced by the nanowires and magnetic field involve some cell membrane rupture. Results suggest that magnetic nanowires can kill cancer cells. The proposed process requires simple and low-cost equipment with exposure to only very weak magnetic fields for short time periods. © 2015 Contreras et al.},

abstract={The need for constant monitoring of environmental conditions has produced an increase in the development of wireless sensor networks (WSN). The drive towards smart cities has produced the need for smart sensors to be able to monitor what is happening in our cities. This, combined with the decrease in hardware component prices and the increase in the popularity of open hardware, has favored the deployment of sensor networks based on open hardware. The new trends in Internet Protocol (IP) communication between sensor nodes allow sensor access via the Internet, turning them into smart objects (Internet of Things and Web of Things). Currently, WSNs provide data in different formats. There is a lack of communication protocol standardization, which turns into interoperability issues when connecting different sensor networks or even when connecting different sensor nodes within the same network. This work presents a sensorized platform proposal that adheres to the principles of the Internet of Things and theWeb of Things. Wireless sensor nodes were built using open hardware solutions, and communications rely on the HTTP/IP Internet protocols. The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) SensorThings API candidate standard was used as a neutral format to avoid interoperability issues. An environmental WSN developed following the proposed architecture was built as a proof of concept. Details on how to build each node and a study regarding energy concerns are presented. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={The Sun was one of the central points for observations as long as human cultures are known. After researchers observed the extension of the solar rainbow spectrum towards shorter wavelengths with increasing altitude they started measurements of the solar ultraviolet spectrum from balloons in 1934. The acquisition of spectra in the extreme ultraviolet and soft X-ray spectral regions was beginning after 1946 using photographic recordings aboard rockets. However, it took six more years to achieve good spectral resolution below about 220 nm because servomechanisms had to be developed to fairly accurately point the spectrographs to the Sun during the rocket flight. Another big step forward was achieved by the application of photoelectric recording technology and by using satellites as a platform to observe qualitatively the strong variability of the solar ultraviolet irradiance on short-, medium- and long-term scales. Until the end of the past century these measurements have been strongly impeded by the inherent degradation of the EUV instruments with time. Since there is progress solving this serious problem, measurements with sufficient radiometric accuracy allow composing the data available to the first set of ultraviolet data covering a period of eleven years. Based on the sophisticated instrumentation verified in space, future EUV measurements of the solar spectral irradiance on the International Space Station are promising accuracy levels of about 5%. Added by low-cost equipment on-line measurements will allow providing data needed in ionospheric modeling for correcting propagation delays of navigation signals from space to Earth. Adding ultraviolet airglow and auroral emission measurements the impact of space weather on the ionosphere can be studied and also be used deriving more detailed correction procedures for the evaluation of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals. © 2015 Optical Society of America.},

Still, less attention is paid on the positioning capabilities specified in the LTE standard. Thus, an experimental LTE positioning receiver is presented to assess the positioning accuracy in commercial LTE deployments. This receiver is based on a software defined radio (SDR) and a low-cost radio-frequency (RF) front-end, such as the universal software radio peripheral (USRP) or a DVB-T dongle with the Realtek RTL2832U chipset. These two platforms are then used to capture and post-process real LTE signals generated in the laboratory.

abstract={Numerous models are published integrating produce respiration data and gas transmission properties for packaging material in order to predict the optimal equilibrium headspace gas atmosphere. Gaining the data needed for input in the models can be cumbersome, and data found in literature are often given in different units and not stated at the desired storage conditions, e.g., gas transmission rates are usually measured at 23°C. Respiration data might also show great variation due to variety, quality and season, and literature data cannot automatically be transferred to own products. In this work a procedure for measuring produce respiration rates and gas transmission rate of the whole package is outlined. The respiration measurements are performed using low cost equipment and commercial packages as respiration chambers. The obtained results from the measurements for tested products were found to be in accordance with respiration data found in literature. The O2 and CO2 transmission rates of the whole packages were measured by a static method using a low cost gas analyser. The method can be used for packages with and without perforations, and it was also possible, within an acceptable accuracy, to calculate the transmission rate for a single hole. The respiration rates were measured at low and abused temperature (2 and 6°C for plums and 5 and 10°C for broccoli). Gas transmission rates of the packages were measured at 5, 10 and 23°C. Finally, a simple predictive model integrating produce respiration rates and gas transmission rate data for the whole package was developed. The modelled data were shown to be in accordance with empirical measurements for plums (Prunus domestica L.) packaged in laser-perforated pouches and for broccoli florets (Brassica oleracea) in sealed trays. The described procedure using low cost equipment and commercial packages is an alternative method for laboratories, packaging material producers, farmers and packaging houses to optimize their packages based on own measurements under realistic storage temperatures.},

The proposal has been adopted in the Computer Engineering undergraduate program at the Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul (UFMS) - Brazil. Most of the ICE courses from computer engineering programs around the world have put focus on teaching initial basic theoretical concepts of algorithms, logic, and digital systems. The ICE course at UFMS has been organized to encompass from initial basic concepts up to a practical and motivating set of experimental activities in order to clarify the program focus and to connect the concepts to practical applications. To evaluate the impacts of this new curriculum and methodology, an online anonymous survey has been carried out with students from 2011,2012, and 2013 classes. After a statistical analysis and validation of the answers, 28% of the students have pointed that the activities have been determinant to increase their motivation to study computer engineering. The impacts on students motivation, since the first semester, have been observed in the students evasion rate. The percentage of evasions in the computer engineering is less than other engineering programs at UFMS. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={We present a robotic platform based on the open source RepRap 3D printer that can print and maintain chemical artificial life in the form of a dynamic, chemical droplet. The robot uses computer vision, a self-organizing map, and a learning program to automatically categorize the behavior of the droplet that it creates. The robot can then use this categorization to autonomously detect the current state of the droplet and respond. The robot is programmed to visually track the droplet and either inject more chemical fuel to sustain a motile state or introduce a new chemical component that results in a state change (e.g., division). Coupling inexpensive open source hardware with sensing and feedback allows for replicable real-time manipulation and monitoring of nonequilibrium systems that would be otherwise tedious, expensive, and error-prone. This system is a first step towards the practical confluence of chemical, artificial intelligence, and robotic approaches to artificial life. © 2015 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

abstract={We investigated submerged ruins from the 1923 Nebukawa landslide, which was caused by the 1923 Kanto earthquake. The on-land areas affected by the landslide have been restored and evidence of the landslide is mostly gone, but huge structures that appear to be man-made have been observed by divers on the seafloor near the area of the landslide. We used a fish finder designed for leisure use and other low-cost equipment to conduct a marine acoustic survey. Because the affected area off Nebukawa is close to shore and shallow and the tools were sufficiently lightweight, we were able to use an inflatable raft for the survey. We created a bathymetric map and side-scan images showing features of the landslide mass and scattered huge structures exposed on the seafloor. After the acoustic investigations, we conducted a diving investigation and were able to ascertain that the structures were made of concrete and were most likely parts of the old Nebukawa station. The ruins were displaced about 260 to 320. m horizontally from the original station location (to 110-170. m offshore) and were mixed with coarse rock fragments from the landslide mass. The distribution of bottom materials suggests that the landslide struck the seafloor and then traveled as far as 460. m offshore from the coastline. The landslide had an equivalent coefficient of friction (H/L) of about 0.15, indicating high mobility. The landslide probably transformed into a turbulent flow mixed with basal sandy sediments, which propelled the debris farther offshore. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={With mobile and wireless devices becoming pervasive, the low-cost hardware implementations of security functions are being desired. A compact hardware implementation of SM3 hash algorithm is presented in this paper. A SRAM is used to do message expansion function instead of shift registers which are used in common hardware implementations, and the computation units are saved as much as possible. In addition, the values of A~H and V0~V7 registers are updated in serial shift way when they are initialized and updated. Compared to traditional designs, the store resources for message expansion function can be shared with other modules to reduce the cost of a system. The Synopsys' DC synthesis results show that the area of the compact SM3 is approximate 9822 GEs while its throughput can be as high as 276 Mbps. If the SRAM can be shared with other modules, only 7806 GEs are additional required to add the SM3 hardware module in the system. The compact architecture can be accommodated to resource-constrained systems for its advantages of low-cost and low-power. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The flexibility of software-defined radio (SDR) technology has been proposed to support various applications from the dynamic usage of the radio frequency spectrum to the implementation of radio access technologies in the commercial and military domain. A new generation of low-cost SDR devices has emerged in the last few years, opening new possibilities to implement inexpensive security attacks against radio protocols and systems. Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunication (DECT) is a European Telecommunications Standards Institute standard for short-range cordless communications with a worldwide installed base. In this paper, we survey the state of art for the application of low-cost SDRs to the security domain, and we describe a complete implementation of a passive eavesdropping attack against DECT digital voice communication, where the DECT communication is not encrypted. The framework, which implements the attack, has been deployed on two different types of low-cost SDR platforms to show the flexibility and extendibility of the implementation. The performance of the framework has been evaluated on the basis of different parameters and different approaches, and the experimental results are presented in the paper. The framework has demonstrated its effectiveness to implement an eavesdropping attack against DECT even at great distances with low-cost equipment. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={This paper details the implementation of a low-cost, open hardware, cloud-based intelligent farm automation system. Physical parameters such as soil moisture, temperature and humidity are measured by employing sensors sited across the monitored area. The parametric data is transmitted to the Atmel ATmega328P microcontroller from the sensors using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The cloud performs real time intelligence operations based on periodic sensor inputs obtained from the farm and transmits control commands to the microcontroller. The novelty of the system lies in the use of BLE and in the intelligence provided by the cloud. The physically monitored, as well as virtually obtained parameters, at the cloud level allow intelligent command generation, facilitated by a data exchange system that leverages the existing telecom network prevalent in developing countries. Based on the cloud commands, the ATmega328P microcontroller controls the operation time period of the irrigation system thus conserving both water and energy. The approximate cost of implementing the proof of concept system elaborated in this paper by using off the shelf components at retail price is about USD 16. It is expected that the system cost will further reduce on mass production and commercialization. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Recently, with the innovation of modern medical technology, the elderly population has been rapidly increased than before. In the past, without the Internet technology, the elderly must spend their life in the nursing home even though they are not in any serious sickness due to the expensive wage of the personal curator. Fortunately, nowadays, the capability of mobile phone and the quality of networking have been improved. With the proposed model, the elderly health care strategy is changed. To begin with, the questionnaire has been carried out to the caretaker of the elderly. The result shows that almost all of them would like to tend the elderly at home if these three major problems; falling, medicine taking, and monitoring, can be solved. In this paper, not only the senior patient can recuperate at home safely without home health aides but also, this new model runs with everyday technologies and low-cost equipment such as Smartphone. The falling is detected with an integrated tri-axial gyroscope and the alert will be sent to the caretaker via the Internet. The medicine taking problem is solved with the medicine box that can be controlled by the caretaker in a remote distance. Lastly, the monitoring application is developed. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={With mobile and wireless devices becoming pervasive, low-cost hardwares of security functions are being desired. A compact hardware implementation of the SM3 hash algorithm is presented in this paper. A SRAM is used to do message expansion function instead of shift registers which are used in common hardware implementations, and the values of A&H and V0&V7 registers are updated in the serial shift way when they are initialized and updated. The computation units are saved as much as possible. Compared with traditional designs, the store resources for message expansion function can be shared with other modules to reduce the cost of a system. The Synopsys' DC synthesis results show that the area of the compact SM3 is approximate 8277 GEs while its throughput can be as high as 276 Mbps. If the SRAM is shared with other modules, only 6904 GEs are required to implement the SM3 hardware module in the system. The compact architecture can be accommodated to resource-constrained systems for its advantages of low-cost and low-power. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={When the study on the relationship between the Head-of-Bed (HOB) angle and ventilator-associated pneumonia is performed, the fact that the HOB angle can only be measured intermittently imposes a significant limitation on the study. Therefore, there has been demand for the development of a device that can measure the HOB angle continuously. In this paper, we propose the rapid prototyping of an HOB measurement system using open-source hardware and software. The proposed system helps to maintain the HOB angle at a particular angle by displaying the angle and helps the medical study of pneumonia patients by enabling continuous data acquisition. Firstly, we eliminate the process of making an MCU board by utilizing an open-source hardware mbed LPC1768. Secondly, we reduce the software development time by using libraries and hence enabling the easy use of peripherals. Thirdly, for rapid prototyping, we build the enclosure of the proposed system using a 3D printer. The proposed system can be attached and detached to and from a bed. Therefore, we can attach it to the bed of a patient for whom measurement of the HOB angle is necessary. Finally, we check the measurement performance and the validity of the proposed system through an experiment utilizing an incremental encoder. © ICROS 2015.},

The authors argue that the use of open-source hardware in building neuroIS research tools will dramatically decrease the costs and complexity associated with research in university laboratories. In this work, we discuss the use of open-source hardware in neuroIS research. We present the design of a neuroIS research tool based on BITalino, a biosignal capturing and processing platform.

abstract={During the last couple of years, as low cost hardware devices became more and more powerful, a new approach in presenting ship structures become feasible. This allowed the usage of technologies, previously reserved for high end simulation systems, to be incorporated into applications running on mid-range hardware found in shipyards. In this paper an alternative approach in data manipulation will be presented, using stereo 3D extensions to our TRIDENT ShipExplorer system. Experience in developing those extensions will be presented, as well as problems that had to be solved, including discussion to solutions used to solve them. © 2015: The Royal Institution of Naval Architects.},

First, the hardware of the vehicle, including the actuators, sensors, and control structure, is described. Second, to study the relationship between the thrust forces and the performance of the ROV, a mathematical model of the vehicle in the form of a kinematic and kinetic model is established. Next, a hybrid control algorithm consisting of two components, namely model-based and PID algorithms, is proposed for surge speed, depth, and heading control. The effectiveness of the hybrid control algorithm is then verified by the ROV mathematical model-based simulations. Finally, free running tests for depth control are conducted to verify the robustness and reliability of the control structure and proposed algorithms. © 2014, Fuji Technology Press.

abstract={Increasing design complexity, skyrocketing fabrication costs for modern digital systems coupled with an unacceptably large number of silicon respins led to growing importance of comprehensive and automated design verification. Akin to software configuration management, it is becoming commonplace to maintain large hardware design code-bases with hardware configuration management tools. A missing piece of crucial technology in this approach is to manage design verification across evolving hardware designs. In this paper, we propose an efficient methodology for automatically localizing design errors across design versions. The proposed technique, Evo Deb, can be easily integrated into a hardware configuration management framework and is scalable for large designs. We demonstrate the efficacy of Evo Deb on a couple of bugs on open-source hardware designs across multiple evolving variants. © 2015 IEEE.},

Test time is heavily reduced relative to traditional liquid crystal tests, and data processing is substantially simplified from transient methodologies. The thin walls minimize the impact of lateral conduction and simplify the conduction corrections.

Using a four point correspondence between the scene and virtual one we compute extrinsic camera parameters, and project virtual scene on the image plane, which is the ground truth for depth map.

abstract={Direct-conversion radio receivers can offer highly integrated low-cost hardware solutions for spectrum sensing in cognitive radio systems. However, these receivers are susceptible to radio frequency (RF) impairments, such as in-phase and quadrature-phase imbalance, low-noise amplifier nonlinearities and phase noise, which limit the spectrum sensing capabilities. In this paper, we study the joint effects of RF impairments on energy detection based spectrum sensing in multi-channel environments. In particular, we provide an analytical framework for the evaluation of the probabilities of detection and false alarm, assuming Rayleigh fading and approximating the joint effects of RF impairments by a Gaussian distribution. Numerical results illustrate the detrimental effects of RF imperfections on the spectrum sensing performance, which bring significant losses in the spectrum utilization. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Photographic documentation in medicine is of increasing importance. Efficient methods are required to properly register and calibrate the images. Usually, a standard reference card with special color pattern is placed in the aperature of the image. Localization and extraction of such cards is a critical step. In this paper, we adopt an iterative lattice detection algorithm developed for outdoor images. Once the lattice is extracted, crossing points of the color fields are used for perspective geometric transform while the color plates guide the color calibration process. Our method is tested on 37 images collected within the German Calciphylaxis Registry. At least, 28 out of the 35 possible grid points have been extracted in all the non-standardizes photographs, with at most two false positive detections. The lowest F-measure was above 80%. Hence, ruler and other calibration devices become obsolete and wound imaging can be performed with low-cost hardware, too. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.},

In this paper, we demonstrate that information from low-cost hardware performance counters commonly available on modern processors is sufficient to identify and separate the causes of communication traffic and performance degradation. We have developed SAM, a Sharing-Aware Mapper that uses the aggregated coherence and bandwidth event counts to separate traffic caused by data sharing from that due to memory accesses. When these counts exceed pre-determined thresholds, SAM effects task to core assignments that colocate tasks that share data and distribute tasks with high demand for cache capacity and memory bandwidth. Our new mapping policies automatically improve execution speed by up to 72% for individual parallel applications compared to the default Linux scheduler, while reducing performance disparities across applications in multiprogrammed workloads. © 2015 USENIX Annual Technical Conference.},

abstract={The paper deals with the issues to monitor the energy performance of Photo Voltaic (PV) fields by means of low cost hardware. In fact, the monitoring systems for low or medium rated power PV plants are often constituted by a limited number of sensors and low processing capacity. These systems allow a supervision of the PV fields when strong reductions of the produced energy happen, but they are ineffective to alert the end user about a gradual energy reduction. These issues are related to the natural ageing of PV modules, the dust or dirt accumulation on the PV modules, and so on. This paper proposes a methodology based on inferential tools, which return information about the correct operation of the PV field. The methodology needs an initial training that allows to define one or more reference strings, which will be used as benchmarks for future comparisons. © 2015 IEEE.},

In this paper, we investigate a way of using the aforementioned AT equipments in order to access many different devices without assistive preferences. The solution takes advantage of open source hardware and its core component consists of an affordable Linux embedded system: it grabs data coming from the assistive software, which runs on the user's personal device, then, after processing, it generates native keyboard and mouse HID commands for the target computing device controlled by the end user. This process supports any operating system available on the target machine and it requires no specialized software installation; therefore the user with a disability can rely on a single assistive tool to control a wide range of computing platforms, including conventional computers and many kinds of mobile devices, which receive input commands through the USB HID protocol. © 2015 The authors and IOS Press.

abstract={The protective relays in the Taipower Extra High Voltage (EHV) substations have different brand models because they were procured during different time periods. There are differential current protective relays and directional distance protective relays from SEL, differential current protective relays from GE, and protective relays from Toshiba. The different relays each have different settings and maintenance modes, including those with the RS232 and RS485 serial ports and ASCII text command mode maintenance operations, those using the factory GUI utility to connect to the remote relay, to login, and to change the flag settings, those that use MODBUS protocol to communicate with remote intelligent devices, and those that exchange information with other substations using DNP3 protocol. A small portion of the old SEL devices include an FTP protocol mode to download flag situations. As learned from actual operating experience, as all protective relay flags are manually modified, it is impossible to judge whether they were modified properly until the time trip results are available when an accident occurs. Therefore, if the electrical protective relays at a substation were to be altered by unauthorized persons, supervisors have no method of detection. Thus, this paper proposes an open source hardware and software architecture with regular data inquiries, storage, and comparisons to determine whether online relay settings have been altered. © 2015 Taylor and Francis Group, London.},

abstract={This paper presents in-flight testing results of the implementation of an immunity-based approach for aircraft failure assessment on an unmanned aerial vehicle research system under upset conditions. The bio-inspired approach relies on the fault tolerance capabilities of the artificial immune system and a hierarchical multi self strategy combined with neural networks for feature definition. A low cost hardware and software system has been used to generate nominal and upset flight test data. The system includes an autopilot and sensor fusion solution that uses a non-linear Kalman Filter combined with a complementary filter to estimate the attitude states. Flight data were used to define a large set of 2-dimensional self/non-self projections as well as for the generation of antibodies designated for health assessment of aerial system under upset conditions. The methodology presented in this paper is assessed in terms of detection rates and false alarms. © 2015, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc. All rights received.},

abstract={Reliable and secured communication between two or more devices require wired connection. A wireless communication such as - Bluetooth, WI-Fi, ZigBee etc. provides flexible and inexpensive solution for remote applications. A large number of low cost hardware platforms such as Raspberry Pi, Arduino, mbed boards etc. are available that do not provide any inbuilt wireless module but are equipped with UART, I2C ports for design and development of Internet of Things (IoT) and embedded applications. Designers face the difficulty to use such a low cost hardware for wireless communication in order to implement these applications. In this paper, Design & Development of Daughter Board for Raspberry Pi to support Bluetooth Communication using UART is proposed as an integrated solution. Results of various QoS parameters such as transmission rate, file format(text, pdf, image & audio), baud ratesand range for Bluetooth communication between two devices are presented. The result shows that Bluetooth module is capable of transmitting files of same size in different format approximately in same time. Proposed solution can further be extended to different protocols such as Wi-Fi and ZigBee etc. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Spatial haptic interfaces have been around for 20 years. Yet, few affordable devices have been produced, and the design space in terms of physical workspace and haptic fidelity of devices that have been produced are limited and discrete. In this paper, an open-source, open-hardware module-based kit is presented that allows an interaction designer with little electro-mechanical experience to manufacture and assemble a fully working spatial haptic interface. It also allows for modification in shape and size as well as tuning of parameters to fit a particular task or application. Results from an evaluation showed that the haptic quality of the WoodenHaptics device was on par with a Phantom Desktop and that a novice could assemble it with guidance in a normal office space. This open source starting kit, uploaded free-to-download online, affords sketching in hardware; it "unsticks" the hardware from being a highly-specialized and esoteric craft to being an accessible and user-friendly technology, while maintaining the feel of high-fidelity haptics.},

GenLaban can be implemented with a low-cost equipment but an efficient method that allows users converting body motions to scores. The key components of GenLaban are the analysis of body motions, the quantization of body postures and the determination of body parts carrying the body weight. All the processes are under supervision of a Labanotation expert to ensure the notation meaning correctly as the use for the dance composition. The experiments showed that for dancers, dance instructors and choreographers, GenLaban is a potential tool for notating dance movements into Labanotation scores enabling them to be accurately interpreted. At present the system can handle a subset of Labanotation covering many of the fundamental movements. However, Labanotation is rich in symbols and new symbols are continually being introduced and will be incorporated in the GenLaban tool as time permits. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.},

abstract={In this article, we show the development of a low-cost hardware/software system based on close range photogrammetry to track the movement of a person performing weightlifting. The goal is to reduce the costs to the trainers and athletes dedicated to this sport when it comes to analyze the performance of the sportsman and avoid injuries or accidents. We used a web-cam as the data acquisition hardware and develop the software stack in Processing using the OpenCV library. Our algorithm extracts size, position, velocity, and acceleration measurements of the bar along the course of the exercise. We present detailed characteristics of the system with their results in a controlled setting. The current work improves the detection and tracking capabilities from a previous version of this system by using HSV color model instead of RGB. Preliminary results show that the system is able to profile the movement of the bar as well as determine the size, position, velocity, and acceleration values of a marker/target in scene. The average error finding the size of object at four meters of distance is less than 4%, and the error of the acceleration value is 1.01% in average. © 2015 SPIE.},

abstract={In this work, we develop a realistic threat model for attacks on modern air traffic communication networks and show that current state-of-the-art countermeasures such as multilater-ation are insuffcient. We propose two alternatives, a statistical location verification technique and a grid-based location estimation approach, to deal with the identified threats. We evaluate our proposals using real-world ight data and quantify their effectiveness in terms of aircraft location accuracy, resilience to message injection attacks, attack detection speed, and surveillance coverage. Our results show that the statistical verification approach can increase the effective air traffic surveillance coverage compared to multilateration by a factor of more than 100. Concerning our location estimation method, we find that the mean aircraft location accuracy can be increased by up to 41% in comparison with multilateration while also being able to pinpoint ground-based attackers with a mean error of 145m for air-based attackers. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposal is lightweight as it does not require any changes to the existing air traffic protocols and transmitters, and is easily implemented using only low-cost hardware. is held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Wired Audio Networking is an established practice since years, based on both proprietary solutions or open hardware and protocols. One of the most cost-effective solutions is the use of a general purpose IEEE 802.3 infrastructure and personal computers running IP based protocols. One obvious shortcoming of such setup is the lack of synchronization at the audio level and the presence of a network delay affected by jitter. Two approaches to sustain a continuous audio flow are described, implemented by the authors in open source projects based on a relative and absolute time adaptive resampling. A description of the mechanisms is provided along with simulated and measured results, which show the validity of both approaches.},

abstract={Timing is critical when trying to engage students in various engineering career paths. While many 'National Engineers Week' programs exist for primary and middle school students, there is a lack of hands on activities for students in the 9th-12th grades. It is often difficult to devise experiments for this age group that are interesting and not juvenile. Yet, it is during these crucial years that most students are lost to science, math and engineering. Engaging students and presenting opportunities for invention and excitement is important in the teen years, when peer pressure and the distractions of friends, social events, and activities are particularly high.1. There are a number of open source programming and affordable hardware platforms that can be used to implement low cost and interactive programs to promote innovation with various age groups. In this paper we share our work, as well as our learnings on how to make the workshops more effective. We have created various Arduino projects that can be customized to grade levels ranging from grades 7-12, and even college undergraduate students. The various projects we describe in this paper have been used to interact with students of different grade levels to engage in basic elements of engineering and computer programming. The classes should be set up to work in groups to promote shared innovation, teamwork and collaboration with peers. The open source and hardware experimenting exposed the students to various career paths ranging from software engineer, to electronic engineers and basic elements of various other engineering paths. This paper is designed to demonstrate the promotion of the engineering profession in schools through the use of Arduino Uno, Raspberry Pi Gemma kits, and Flora kits. The programs are also designed to accommodate classroom setting, workshops, or as an in-class field trip. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Currently, human-computer interfaces have a number of useful applications for people. The use of electromyographic signals (EMG) has shown to be effective for human-computer interfaces. The classification of patterns based on EMG signals has been successfully applied in various tasks such as motion detection to control of video games. An alternative to increasing access to these applications is the use of low-cost hardware to sample the EMG signals considering a real-time response. This paper presents a methodology for recognizing patterns of EMG signals given by arm movements in real time. Our proposal is based on an artificial Neural Network, Multilayer Perceptron, where the EMG signals are processed by a set of signal processing techniques. The hardware used for obtaining the signal is based on Ag/AgCl connected to the EKG/EMG-Shield plate mounted on a Arduino One R3 card which is used to control a video game. The implemented application achieves an accuracy above 90% using less than 0.2 s for recognition of actions in time of testing. Our methodology is shown to predict different movements of the human arm reliably, at a low cost and in real time. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Multitransform techniques have been widely used in modern video coding and have better compression efficiency than the single transform technique that is used conventionally. However, every transform needs a corresponding hardware implementation, which results in a high hardware cost for multiple transforms. A novel method that includes a five-step operation sharing synthesis and architecture-unification techniques is proposed to systematically share the hardware and reduce the cost of multitransform coding. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, a unified architecture is designed using the method for all of the six transforms involved in the H.264 video codec: 2D 4 × 4 forward and inverse integer transforms, 2D 4 × 4 and 2 × 2 Hadamard transforms, and 1D 8 × 8 forward and inverse integer transforms. Firstly, the six H.264 transform architectures are designed at a low cost using the proposed five-step operation sharing synthesis technique. Secondly, the proposed architecture-unification technique further unifies these six transform architectures into a low cost hardware-unified architecture. The unified architecture requires only 28 adders, 16 subtractors, 40 shifters, and a proposed mux-based routing network, and the gate count is only 16308. The unified architecture processes 8 pixels/clock-cycle, up to 275 MHz, which is equal to 707 Full-HD 1080 p frames/second. © 2015 Po-Hung Chen et al.},

abstract={In the production of aluminum alloy strips for packaging industry twin roll strip casting technique is now being extensively employed. The twin roll caster has advantage of the energy saving, low cost equipment and rapid solidification. The present research aimed to investigate the microstructure and hardness of twin roll strip cast aluminum alloys strips by varying the speed of roller cast. Al-Mg-Si ingot was melt in an induction furnace. Once it melted, the liquid was poured into a crucible attached to a twin roller cast to maintain the liquid temperature at 700°C. Molten alloy was poured in the gap between the copper rollers to produce the strips. The rotational speed of the cast rolls was varied from 60-30 rpm. During this process, the melt solidified to form strips. A specimen of 50 mm length cut from the cast strips was subjected to physical and mechanical characterization. Variation in hardness and microstructure of the produced trip were discussed. © (2015) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

It started in 2006 with 82 cities, restricted to electrocardiography analysis. Currently it extends to 772 cities-performing also Holter, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and retinography analysis-and 48 ambulances in the north of the state, as part of a myocardial infarction system of care. Using low-cost equipment and simple technology, TNMG has employed various strategies to increase telehealth use. The number of ECGs performed by TNMG has progressively increased. It was expected to achieve 2 million in February 2015. The utilization rates were around 90%. It proved to be economically sound, promoting savings of 45M USD for an investment of 10.2M USD. It is currently a regular health service in the state, integrated into the healthcare system. In conclusion, the telehealth model developed in Minas Gerais produced good clinical and economical results. © 2015 IMIA and IOS Press.},

In 2013 CERN acquired a few OCP servers in order to compare performance and power consumption with standard hardware. The conclusions were that there are sufficient savings to motivate an attempt to procure a large scale installation. One objective is to evaluate if the OCP market is sufficiently mature and broad enough to meet the constraints of a public procurement.

abstract={What does open source mean for culture? For knowledge? As cultural production has come to be characterized by contribution as well as consumption and as alternative modes of intellectual property transfer challenge the ‘dominant paradigm’ that knowledge and information should be protected and monetized, the logic of ‘open sourcing’ has extended into many cultural spheres. This article positions ‘openness’ as a value that intermediates between re-usable software code, institutional transparency, and expanded opportunities for participation in knowledge production cultures. By observing and analyzing the expansion of ‘openness’ from computer software to electronics hardware, we can develop a framework that identifies the tensions between socio-cultural visions of knowledge commons and the realities of governing those commons. This research focuses in particular on the knowledge related to electronics hardware and other material objects governed by open hardware licenses. The insights in this article are valuable for anyone studying open source and peer production processes and the knowledge claims surrounding them. © The Author(s) 2015.},

abstract={This study is to construct a non-contact pulse automatic positioning measurement system for Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) using optical triangulation measurements. The system consists of a linear laser, a CMOS image sensor and image analysis software. The linear laser is projected on the pulse beat location on the wrists; the CMOS image sensor records the process and the software analyzes the images. The program mainly uses the optical centroid and fast Fourier transform (FFT) principles to calculate centroid changes (pulse amplitude changes) from the images taken by the CMOS image sensor. It returns the positions of cun, guan and chi pulses automatically in terms of the amplitudes and the signals are then transformed from the time domain (time-amplitude) into the frequency domain (frequency-amplitude) via FFT to obtain the waveforms and frequencies of the cun, guan and chi pulses. It successfully extracts the data from the TCM pulse reading and can be a medical aid system for TCM. Combining the advantages of optical measurement and computer automation, this system provides a non-contact, easy to operate, fast in detection and low-cost equipment design. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Customers will be able to adapt the open platform to their needs by integrating modules of their choice into the platform, thereby constructing individual products that fit their exact needs. Large manufacturers will produce the platforms, and small companies will invent and produce modules that could be interfaced with the open-platform products. Smartphones is an example of an open-platform product, and the Apps that are designed to run on smartphones are examples for modules. Each customer downloads certain Apps that fit his/her needs, thereby creating an individual smartphone. The Apps, however, are software modules. The modules that are considered in this paper are hardware modules. Open-platform products will create a new paradigm in product design and utilization that we call the Mass-Individualization paradigm. The Mass-Individualization paradigm will boost the economy by (1) creating many new jobs in module production companies and (2) increasing the level of sales of consumer products. © 2015 The Authors.},

abstract={A method using different light sources and sensors have already been used to approximate weighting functions to calculate light transmittance in sunglasses. Although it made possible a low cost equipment that inform the user about its sunglasses, each transmittance test is still dependent of its components. We tested two methods, using polynomial approximation and artificial neural network, that would open the possibility for the use of a fixed light source and sensor for all light transmittance tests from the standard. Spectrophotometry, visible transmittance and traffic light transmittance was calculated in 45 lenses of sunglasses, used as samples for testing the methodologies. The tests included a white LED, a RGB sensor, and electronic for control and signal acquisition. Bland - Altman analysis tool was used to calculate the agreement between the method and the transmittances calculated in the spectrophotometer. Both methods, had an approximation within the deviation limit required by NBR15111. The system with the polynomial regression showed lower deviations than artificial neural networks. A larger number of samples can improve the methods in order to obtain an optimal calibration that includes all sunglasses. No meter in the market can calculate accurately all light transmittances measurements required for the sunglasses. The methodology was applied only for the visible light, while UV and infrared spectrum remains to be tested. The methodology tested presented a way for simple low-cost equipment for all light transmittance tests in sunglasses. © 2015 SPIE.},

To tackle this problem, we introduce μPnP: a hardware and software solution for plug-and-play integration of embedded peripherals with IoT devices. μPnP provides support for: driver development, automatic integration of third-party peripherals, discovery and remote access to peripheral services. This is achieved through a low-cost hardware identification approach, a lightweight driver language and a multicast network architecture.

abstract={There is no doubt that computer architecture represents a core course in computer science curriculum. A computer architecture course involves mainly the microprocessor structure and operation which constitutes the heart of the whole system. Due to microprocessor complexity, a number of simulation software solutions have been developed for supporting the corresponding courses. On the other hand, simulators offer only a visual environment where the students cannot change operational or structural characteristics for studying the corresponding microprocessor behavior. Moreover, and much more important is the fact that students cannot demystify the physical level where bit manipulation takes place. A novel and low cost approach for studying in depth microprocessor structure and operation at programming and hardware level is presented and finally proposed for the very first time in this paper. The student uses programmable hardware modules for developing the internal structure of a microprocessor. Finally, the developed microprocessor can be studied from programmer’s or developer’s view. © 2015 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.},

abstract={While solid theoretical foundations are strictly necessary for any kind of engineering and scientific education, students benefit greatly from applications and practical examples to supplement their learning. Especially in engineering education, problem-based learning and laboratories are a centerpiece of higher education curricula [1] [2] [3]. Creating laboratories involves a lot of work for the educator as well as considerable investments in hardware. One of the possible solutions for this problem is the creation of remote laboratories where students can access a lab setup over computer networks. Thus, a single setup can be used by several lab groups as well as across different classes. However, this usually means that students have no physical access to the hardware and the setup adds little when compared to a simulation. Another solution to reduce hardware cost is low-cost mass market hardware [4]. In this paper, we propose that a single laboratory setup can often be used to demonstrate more than one concept. Thus, a mass market low-cost hardware setup can be leveraged across different classes, labs, and disciplines. This solution offers both a reduction in hardware costs due to the use of inexpensive hardware as well as a reduction in development time over individual setups for concept. In addition individual students or groups can have access to their own hardware to gain hands-on experience. As an example we present an embedded system that automatically tracks a ball with a camera. The setup shown in figure 1 consists of an Arduino Uno to control the motor that turns the camera and a Raspberry Pi which handles imaging and image analysis. The example can be used as a laboratory exercise for image acquisition and processing, controls, parameter tuning, system identification, testing, and deployment on embedded platforms.},

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to articulate the need for an open, extensible robot platform to support swarm robotic research using vision and to propose one such platform. The platform proposed here is intended for research which trades smaller population size with more sophisticated individual robot capabilities. The validation of proposed swarm robotic algorithms using real-world hardware is essential, but is fraught with difficulty due to the expense and complexity of developing and maintaining multiple operational units. A number of open hardware platforms have been pro- posed, although most prioritize small size and low cost over advanced capabilities such as vision. We are interested in a number of different research directions which utilize vision as a core capability and find the existing open hardware plat- forms to be insufficient (and existing commercial platforms too expensive). In this paper we describe a set of desirable characteristics for an open, extensible visually-guided robot platform. We then present our solution, the BuPiGo (pronounced buppy-go), describing the hardware itself and a model developed for simulation purposes. We also present some initial results on using the BuPiGo for visual homing| an individual navigation task that we hope to exploit for swarm tasks in the future. Copyright © 2016 ICST.},

abstract={We describe a completely randomizable flow-through outdoor mesocosm for climate change and ecotoxicology studies that was built with inexpensive materials. The 16 raceway tanks allow up to 69 water renewal per hour, avoiding changes in natural abiotic seawater conditions. We use an open-source hardware board (Arduino) that was adapted to control heaters and an innovative CO2 injection system. This system reduced seawater pH up to −0.9 units and increased temperature up to +6℃ in three treatments and a control. Treatments can be continuously compared with the control and vary according to diel fluctuations, thus following the diel range observed in the sea. The mesocosm facility also includes an integrated secondary system of 48 aquaria for ecotoxicology studies. We validated the reproducibility and relevance of our experimental system by analyzing the variation of the total DNA of the microbial community extracted from corals in three elevated temperature scenarios during a 40-day experiment. We also present data from temperature, acidification, and copper contamination trials, which allowed continuous, reliable, and consistent treatment manipulations. © 2015 The Authors.},

abstract={Phenotyping has become the rate-limiting step in using large-scale genomic data to understand and improve agricultural crops. Here, the Bellwether Phenotyping Platform for controlled-environment plant growth and automated multimodal phenotyping is described. The system has capacity for 1140 plants, which pass daily through stations to record fluorescence, near-infrared, and visible images. Plant Computer Vision (PlantCV) was developed as open-source, hardware platform-independent software for quantitative image analysis. In a 4-week experiment, wild Setaria viridis and domesticated Setaria italica had fundamentally different temporal responses to water availability. While both lines produced similar levels of biomass under limited water conditions, Setaria viridis maintained the same water-use efficiency under water replete conditions, while Setaria italica shifted to less efficient growth. Overall, the Bellwether Phenotyping Platform and PlantCV software detected significant effects of genotype and environment on height, biomass, water-use efficiency, color, plant architecture, and tissue water status traits. All ∼79 000 images acquired during the course of the experiment are publicly available. © 2015 The Author.},

abstract={In this article, we examine the challenges of developing intelligent wireless geosystems and the pros and cons of interdisciplinary research. First, we summarize the range of current practices in wireless sensor network research projects by analyzing recent contributions in the literature. Specifically, for each wireless sensor network project, we compile details regarding the scope (e.g., simulation, testbed, real deployment), the type of mote used (e.g., TinyOS, Android, Arduino), and the type of sensors used (e.g., inertial, biological). Next, we discuss reasons why Arduino based wireless devices are perhaps the future of applied wireless sensor network research. Arduino-based systems are inexpensive, easy to use, readily available, well documented, 100% open-source (hardware and software), object oriented, extendable (using the 'shield' concept), and flexible (e.g., in terms of radio choices). Lastly, we discuss the pros and cons of interdisciplinary research; that is, we highlight the struggle between working on difficult, relevant, inherently multi-disciplinary research problems while maintaining scholarship in individual fields. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Music industry has been completely disrupted by a range of new online digital services and social networking systems that has forever changed the way users and businesses experience and use music. This had a tremendous impact on the established music business models that had guided a dozen year-old industry. On what concerns business music users, i.e. businesses that make use of music as part of their own business model, and on the business relation they establish with author societies or their representatives, they are required to pay royalties for the use of music. These royalties need to be distributed and authors will have the opportunity to see their work rewarded properly. The proper distribution of royalties is a non-transparent and complex process. In this paper, the authors present a system, called MusicBeetle that enables the identification, collection and distribution of music royalties through the usage of decentralised system and low cost hardware devices.},

In respect of rural areas, wireless is the only viable alternative for providing affordable telecommunications services. One limiting factor to the growth of wireless broadband penetration is the lack of available spectrum. White Spaces refer to regions of radio spectrum that are not used all the time in a specific geographical location. An assessment study on TV White Spaces availability in Malawi using affordable tools has been described and it was concluded that it is possible to assess the spectrum usage using low cost equipment.

abstract={Vascular stiffness is an indicator of cardiovascular health, with carotid artery stiffness having established correlation to coronary heart disease and utility in cardiovascular diagnosis and screening. State of art equipment for stiffness evaluation are expensive, require expertise to operate and not amenable for field deployment. In this context, we developed ARTerial Stiffness Evaluation for Noninvasive Screening (ARTSENS), a device for image free, noninvasive, automated evaluation of vascular stiffness amenable for field use. ARTSENS has a frugal hardware design, utilizing a single ultrasound transducer to interrogate the carotid artery, integrated with robust algorithms that extract arterial dimensions and compute clinically accepted measures of arterial stiffness. The ability of ARTSENS to measure vascular stiffness in vivo was validated by performing measurements on 125 subjects. The accuracy of results was verified with the state-of-the-art ultrasound imaging-based echo-tracking system. The relation between arterial stiffness measurements performed in sitting posture for ARTSENS measurement and sitting/supine postures for imaging system was also investigated to examine feasibility of performing ARTSENS measurements in the sitting posture for field deployment. This paper verified the feasibility of the novel ARTSENS device in performing accurate in vivo measurements of arterial stiffness. As a portable device that performs automated measurement of carotid artery stiffness with minimal operator input, ARTSENS has strong potential for use in large-scale screening. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a new and cost-effective rapid control prototyping (RCP) system based on the Arduino Due and Matlab/Simulink. The proposed RCP system has a feature that a computer on which Simulink is running acts as a realtime controller and the Arduino Due performs data acquisition, transmission of the data to and from a computer through a built-in high speed USB interface, and the application of control data received from Simulink. For its implementation, we develop 7 input and output blocks for use with Simulink, all of which are implemented from a single S-function. We also propose a method through which we can overcome the problem arising when the sampling time of the control system is not constant. The proposed RCP system has several advantages over existing methods such as good maintainability, portability due to the USB interface, low cost, and no necessity for C-code generation even though it can only be applied to control systems with moderate sampling rates. It is expected that the proposed RCP system can be useful in teaching control-related topics to undergraduate and graduate students. © Avestia Publishing, 2015.},

abstract={Summary An embedded model predictive controller (eMPC) based on the linear MPC module in Statoil Estimation and Prediction Tool for Identification and Control has been developed, and it is intended to facilitate the MPC application on embedded hardware. The control design approach illustrates a viable way of migrating from an industrial PC-based MPC technology to an embedded platform. This work also provides the transformations and the real-time considerations necessary to achieve a functional high-performance predictive controller on a low-cost embedded hardware, with limited computational resources. The eMPC was implemented for rapid prototyping on the Ethernut 5 open-source hardware, and its performance was tested for a simulated process. The concept was tested using a real MPC application developed for a prototype of a new industrial process that requires an advanced embedded multivariable, constraint handling control solution. The results confirm the viability of the embedded MPC design approach. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

This technique is especially promising in the area of rapid automated damage detection and quantification. In collaboration with a major industry partner from the aerospace sector advanced thermography-based NDT software for impact damaged composites is introduced. The software is based on correlation analysis of time-temperature profiles in combination with an image enhancement process. The prototype software is aiming to a) better visualise the damages in a relatively easy-to-use way and b) automatically and quantitatively measure the properties of the degradation. Knowing that degradation properties play an important role in the identification of degradation types, tests and results on specimens which were artificially damaged have been performed and analyzed. © 2015 The Authors.

In this context, unobtrusive audiovisual monitoring methods can be of great importance. More particularly, the diameter of the pupil is a valuable source of information, since, apart from pathological cases, it can reveal the emotional state, the fatigue and the ageing. To allow for unobtrusive monitoring to gain acceptance, one should seek for efficient methods of monitoring using common low-cost hardware. This paper describes a method for monitoring pupil sizes using a common, low-cost web camera in real time. The proposed approach detects the face and the eyes area at first stage. Subsequently, optimal iris and sclera location and radius, modeled as ellipses, are found using efficient spatial filtering. As a final step, the pupil center and radius is estimated by optimal filtering within the area of the iris. Experimental results show both the efficiency and the effectiveness of our approach.

abstract={The aim of this paper is to present the new, innovative teaching approach and tinkering pedagogy towards developing the students skills in STEM domains (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) with aim to the designing the laboratory for radiation detector development. Involving from one side concept of social situatedness and connectedness, and from another the concept of independent, self-directed and self-regulated student learning, the project was based on assembling the mini-lab, Radiation Sensor Board for Arduino, that was originally designed to help people in Japan to measure levels of radiation in their everyday life after the Fukushima accident. As it was reported elsewhere, this product was an example of crowdsourcing. When Libelien designed the Radiation Sensor Board for Waspmote, the idea was simple: with the Arduino platform people will be able to have easily running their own detector at home while on the other hand with Waspmote platform authorities will be able to deploy autonomous sensor networks to send the radiation levels from dangerous areas using wireless sensor platform ZigBee and GPRS technologies. This paper present students developing project where the Sensor Board for Arduino was used as assembling, teaching tool. The Do-It-Yourself and Internet of Things can be used both in educational, and in the research and development purposes. Owning their own mini-lab at their disposal anytime, students worked at their learning speed. It also boosted the interest, confidence of students and highly affected three domains of learning: cognitive domain (activities like instrumentation, modeling, experimentation, data analysis and design, psychomotor domain (activities like manipulating the apparatus, sensory awareness) and affective domain (behavior and attitudes to learn from failure, creativity, collaborative communication, safety and ethics in the laboratory). We show that networking learning, supported by hands-on labs on chip, and an open source electronics prototyping platform as Arduino and Raspberry Pi, give great opportunities for teaching and learning the tinkering and inventing skills, an request we have to deal with it at the University of Montenegro. Such project support exploratory and serendipitous learning. It moved teching from an emphasis simply on linear logic and programmed instruction, towards non-linear, networked, branching, hypertext views of learning, in which connections between knowledge are made and developed. It is based on principle of situated cognition and Vigotskian thought: situatedness, commonality, interdependency and infrastructure where learning is fascinated by an activity. The presented project integrate a Virtual Learning Environment, networking knowledge and student-owned movable laboratory on the chip, where radiation was used as a topic and where electronics was embedded and embodied. © 2015 RAD Conference Proceedings.},

abstract={Arduino is a free, opensource hardware platform that can be reprogrammed with a piece of opensource software. Software that reprograms hardware allows people to transform the way they understand and interact with the world because electronics are omnipresent in our everyday activities. Elevators run with microcontrollers, in an average car there are seventy microcontrollers and even a microwave oven has microcontrollers. The goal of Arduino is to empower people other than engineers to understand interaction paradigms such as physical, tangible and ubiquitous computing and to create their own interactive artifacts with digital electronics. Eventually, it democratizes learning by practical experimentation so that learners discover how to be independent, how to use things by themselves, how to exploit those things to build interactive systems by themselves and how to be critically demanding about technology. In this talk, I will introduce the feature that makes a free hardware platform such as Arduino a powerful learning tool that foster creativity and I will talk about a vision for the computing education for the 21st century: accessible and pleasant approaches to teach kids how to reprogram the surrounding environment. To this end, I will share experiences and insights gathered from project-based learning experiments with Arduino in secondary schools.. © 2015, Springer Verlag, All Rights Reserved},

abstract={In this article we propose a new algorithm for time synchronization in wireless sensor networks. The algorithm is based on linear regression to achieve long-term synchronization between the clocks of different network motes. Since motes are built using low-cost hardware components, usually their internal local clocks are not very accurate. In addition, there are other effects that affect the clock precision, such as: environmental conditions, supply voltage, aging, manufacturing process. Because some of these causes are external and unpredictable, the clock drift between two motes can change in a random way. Due to these changes, the optimum time window used for performing the linear regression varies with time. The proposed time synchronization algorithm adjusts the resynchronization periods and the linear regression window size to these variations, minimizing the synchronization error. Our algorithm has been tested in real multihop network deployments and the results obtained show higher clock accuracy when compared to the related work. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In this chapter we examine the role of specialized honeypots for detecting and profiling cyber attacks on SCADA-based Industrial Control Systems, debate how to implement such honeypots and provide a complete example of such an appliance. The honeypot concept has been used in general-purpose intrusion detection systems for a long time, with well-recognized contributions in revealing and analysing cyber attacks. However, a number of specialized requirements associated with SCADA systems within Industrial Control Systems in general are not addressed by typical honeypots. In this paper we discuss how the different approaches to security of typical information systems and industrial control systems lead to the need of specialized SCADA honeypots for process control networks. Based on that discussion, we propose a reference architecture for a SCADA network honeypot, discuss possible implementation strategies—based on the lessons learned from the development of a proof-of-concept Modbus honeypot—and propose two alternative deployment strategies, one based on low cost hardware appliances physically and logically located in the automation or field networks and the other based on virtualized field network honeypots physically located in the datacentre and logically located in the field or automation network. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015},

abstract={ExpertEyes is a low-cost, open-source package of hardware and software that is designed to provide portable high-definition eyetracking. The project involves several technological innovations, including portability, high-definition video recording, and multiplatform software support. It was designed for challenging recording environments, and all processing is done offline to allow for optimization of parameter estimation. The pupil and corneal reflection are estimated using a novel forward eye model that simultaneously fits both the pupil and the corneal reflection with full ellipses, addressing a common situation in which the corneal reflection sits at the edge of the pupil and therefore breaks the contour of the ellipse. The accuracy and precision of the system are comparable to or better than what is available in commercial eyetracking systems, with a typical accuracy of less than 0.4° and best accuracy below 0.3°, and with a typical precision (SD method) around 0.3° and best precision below 0.2°. Part of the success of the system comes from a high-resolution eye image. The high image quality results from uncasing common digital camcorders and recording directly to SD cards, which avoids the limitations of the analog NTSC format. The software is freely downloadable, and complete hardware plans are available, along with sources for custom parts. © 2014, Psychonomic Society, Inc.},

They support various multimedia applications including multimedia surveillance networks, target classification, disaster prevention and environmental monitoring, and many more. A comprehensive survey of multimedia communication over WMSNs is presented in Refs. [5,36]. Real-time data transmission over the wireless medium has rigid quality-of-service (QoS) needs; several requirements based on multimedia applications are also given in Refs. [7,25]. Traditional sensor nodes are not suitable for multimedia applications due to their exhaustive requirements.

abstract={This paper describes a flexible Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) actuator designed to increase the limited displacement that these alloys can induce. The SMA actuator has been designed so that it can be bent up to about 180°, providing more freedom of movements and a better integration in wearable robots, specially in soft wearable robots, than standard rigid solutions. Although the actuator length is relatively short, this original design allows a great linear displacement, because it can have one or more loops of the same SMA wire inside the actuator. This implies that the length of the SMA wire is at least two times greater than the length of the actuator. The adopted strategy for both position and speed control that overcomes the hysteresis and prevents overheating the actuator is also described. The control algorithm has been implemented in a rapid control prototyping (RCP) system based on a low cost hardware platform. Finally, the application of this novel actuator in a wrist exoskeleton prototype is shown to demonstrate the feasibility of using the flexible SMA actuator in a real soft wearable robot. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Because of its nature, the photon propagation problem can be very easily parallelized and ran on low cost hardware, avoiding the need for expensive Super Computers. A comparison between Diffusion and MC photon propagation theory is presented in this work with application to neuroimaging, investigating low scattering regions in a mouse-like phantom. Regions such as the Cerebral Spinal Fluid, are currently not taken into account in the classical computational models because of the impossibility to accurately simulate light propagation using fast Diffusive Equation approaches, leading to inaccuracies during the reconstruction process. The goal of the study presented here, is to reduce and further improve the computation accuracy of the reconstructed solution in a highly realistic scenario in the case of neuroimaging in preclinical mouse models. © 2015 SPIE.},

This paper provides a methodological, step-by-step set of specific instructions on how to replicate this project. The undergraduate student applied concepts from operating systems (OS), networks, and electronics into practical steps to exploit readily available open-source software packages and highly-customizable hardware components. Electronic components were soldered to build a modified printed circuit board (PCB) with a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen and push-buttons, and were successfully combined with an external sound card, wireless universal serial bus (USB) card, and an infrared (IR) receiver into a fully assembled, affordable, and reliable device. This developed device can be controlled using any IR-capable remote, is capable of playing high-quality audio, and circumvents advertisements on the free audio streaming web service Pandora Radio using a pre-existing free or paid account. Using this device improves the user's experience of Pandora Radio in several ways while keeping this device portable and preserving all functionality of the Raspberry Pi itself. The goal of this project is to use available tools and integrate various technological fields into a deliverable consumer product.

abstract={Despite the rapid change in cellular technologies, Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) keep a high percentage of their deployed infrastructure using Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) technologies. With about 3.5 billion subscribers, GSM remains as the de facto standard for cellular communications. However, the security criteria envisioned 30 years ago, when the standard was designed, are no longer sufficient to ensure the security and privacy of the users. Furthermore, even with the newest fourth generation (4G) cellular technologies starting to be deployed, these networks could never achieve strong security guarantees because the MNOs keep backwards- compatibility given the huge amount of GSM subscribers. In this paper, we present and describe the tools and necessary steps to perform an active attack against a GSM-compatible network, by exploiting the GSM protocol lack of mutual authentication between the subscribers and the network. The attack consists of a so-called man-in-the- middle attack implementation. By using Software Defined Radio (SDR), open-source libraries and open- source hardware, we setup a fake GSM base station to impersonate the network and therefore eavesdrop any communications that are being routed through it and extract information from their victims. Finally, we point out some implications of the protocol vulnerabilities and how these can not be mitigated in the short term since 4G deployments will take long time to entirely replace the current GSM infrastructure. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={The AMC FMC Carrier Kintex (AFCK) board is a prototype of Data Processing Board (DPB) for CBM experiment. AFCK is open hardware and was designed to be a versatile solution, applicable in multiple systems. In CBM experiment AFCK will serve as a data hub and communication interconnection. One of DPB's functions is synchronization of Front End Electronics (FEE). To provide this functionality, it is necessary to receive the reference clock and timing signals from the Timing and Flow Control system. The received clock after the jitter cleaning will be used as a reference clock for GBT-FPGA based 4.8 Gbps links used for communication with front end electronics. This article will briefly describe AFCK board function in CBM experiment.

The control layer, in particular, is based on a cascade control algorithm able to globally stabilize the position and the attitude of the vehicle. The global property guaranteed by the algorithm allows the quadrotors to perform aggressive maneuvers. The guidance layer is designed to coordinate simultaneously multiple vehicles by generating suitable reference trajectories.

abstract={The great usefulness of remote recording of biomedical signals in most aspects of daily life has generated an increasing interest in this field. Traditionally, monitoring devices from clinical enviroments are bulky, intrusive, and expensive. Thus, the development of wearable, mobile, and low-cost applications is desirable. Nevertheless, recent improvements in open-hardware allow developing low cost devices and portable designs for biosignal monitoring in out-of-lab applications, such as sports, leisure, e-Health, etc. This paper presents a low-cost wearable system able to simultaneously record electrical brain and heart activity (i.e. electroencephalography and electrocardiography). The system is able to send biomedical data to a platform for remote analyses. Both software and hardware are open-source. We assessed the system for its validity and reliability in a real road environment. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Most experimental fields of science and engineering require the use of data acquisition systems (DAQ), devices in charge of sampling and converting electrical signals into digital data and, typically, performing all of the required signal preconditioning. Since commercial DAQ systems are normally focused on specific types of sensors and actuators, systems engineers may need to employ mutually-incompatible hardware from different manufacturers in applications demanding heterogeneous inputs and outputs, such as small-signal analog inputs, differential quadrature rotatory encoders or variable current outputs. A common undesirable side effect of heterogeneous DAQ hardware is the lack of an accurate synchronization between samples captured by each device. To solve such a problem with low-cost hardware, we present a novel modular DAQ architecture comprising a base board and a set of interchangeable modules. Our main design goal is the ability to sample all sources at predictable, fixed sampling frequencies, with a reduced synchronization mismatch (<1 _s) between heterogeneous signal sources. We present experiments in the field of mechanical engineering, illustrating vibration spectrum analyses from piezoelectric accelerometers and, as a novelty in these kinds of experiments, the spectrum of quadrature encoder signals. Part of the design and software will be publicly released online. ©-2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Hardware-in-loop (HiL) simulation focuses on testing of Electronic Control Units (ECU) in virtual real time environment in order to scrutinize the behavior of controller under test. Use of HiL simulation in development process reduces time and cost involved in verification and validation of the ECU's development. Generally, HiL systems developed using dSPACE®, National Instruments® and other platforms used in automotive industry are very costly and sophisticated. For less complex systems a low cost HiL testing approach using an existing target hardware can be opted. It may or may not be possible to use existing hardware, as there might be limitations in the availability of pin count, on-chip peripherals etc. This paper discusses a case study of Electronic Speed Limiter (ESL) where a low-cost HiL testing technique is being implemented for verification and validation of ESL. The ESL HiL system developed using existing target hardware can simulate different vehicle dynamics, driver behaviors, various road profiles and frictional coefficients in approximation to that of real time environment. The development process of a low cost HIL and research outcomes of ESL testing using the developed ESL HiL are discussed in detail. Developed simulation model increased scope of testing control logic of ESL. The results of HIL testing are found likely to 'in-vehicle' testing and at same time controller under test is tested safely with low cost approach. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Introduction: It is well known that Parkinson’s disease is related to a deficit of dopamine (DA) in the region of the brain called the corpus striatum. The aim of this work is to demonstrate the possibility of in vitro closed-loop control of the DA concentration levels. Methods: By applying the electrochemical technique of fast scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV), the measured values were compared with previously selected ones, and the system made decisions to control infusion pumps by dynamically adjusting the DA concentration in a continuous flow injection cell. Low-cost hardware was used for the acquisition and control signals (Arduino board), whereas for processing the collected data, graphical programming software (LabView) was used. Results: The resolution of the system was approximately 0.4 μmol/L, with a time correction of the concentration adjustable between 1 and 90 seconds. The system allowed control of the DA concentration between 1 and 10 μmol/L with an error of approximately +/– 0.8 μmol/L. Conclusion: Although designed to control the DA concentration, the system could be used to control, within the range of the developed FSCV, the concentration of other substances or to turn on brain stimulators. These results encourage the possibility of using the system in clinical studies (in vivo). © 2015 Sociedade Brasileira de Engenharia Biomedica. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Determination of moisture content of soil is absolutely crucial and must be performed frequently to assure the quality of construction work. In a view to suppress the limitations and inaccuracies of the existing methods, a new concept is successfully implemented. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and state-of-the-art electronic circuitry are embedded to realize an automatic measurement system based on an open-source computing platform. Moreover, to facilitate user interaction with the system, a sophisticated graphical user interface (GUI) is created. This system, from both the hardware and software perspective, brings new ideas in, not only the moisture content determination test, but in geotechnical engineering laboratory and field instrumentation in terms of accuracy, automation, and machine intelligence. It will be obvious from this work that open-source hardware and software embedded in test equipment can automate the whole test procedure for almost all types of tests in geotechnical engineering using appropriate sensor, and data-acquisition and processing routines. This paper presents the technical know-how of the system setup, hardware, and software development, workflow, and system validation for the determination of moisture content of subgrade soil in two distinct test modes - supervised and unsupervised. This work will demonstrate that, not only the test procedure can be automated, but time optimization is also possible, which results in at least 50% test time reduction.

abstract={The paper is focused on the building ad-hoc GSM network based on open source software and low-cost hardware. The created Base Transmission Station can be deployed and put into operation in a few minutes in a required area to ensure private communication between connected GSM mobile terminals.

The paper tries to define connection parameters to provide sufficient quality of voice service between the GSM network and IP Multimedia Subsystem. The paper brings practical results of voice call quality measurement between users inside BTS station mobile network and users inside IP Multimedia Subsystem network. The calls are simulated by low-cost embedded solution for speech quality measurement in GSM network. This tool is under development of our laboratory and allows automatic speech quality measurement of any GSM or UMTS mobile network. The Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality method is used to get final comparable results. The communication between BTS station and connected networks has to be secured against the interception from the third party. The influence of the securing method for quality of service is presented in detail. Paper, apart from the quality of service measurement section, describes technical requirements for successful interconnection between BTS and IMS networks.

abstract={With the development of sensor, wireless mobile communication, embedded system and cloud computing, the technologies of Internet of Things (IOT) have been widely used in logistics, Smart Meter, public security, intelligent building and so on. The Internet of Things is regarded as the third wave of information technology after Internet and mobile communication network, which is characterized by more thorough sense and measure, more comprehensive inter operability and intelligence. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) is one of the most important building block for the IOT. It also have recently been in the limelight for many domains. WSN are useful in data collection, event detection or entity tracking applications. The characteristics of sensor networks have imposed various restrictions on their system designs. Since sensor nodes usually are developed by low-cost hardware, one major challenge in the development of many sensor-network applications is to provide high-security features with limited resources. In this paper, we propose a path generation framework with deadline considerations for real-time query processing. To meet the deadline, the framework will assign the time budget to the routing path, and then, derive a feasible path with the assigned time budget. To derive the optimal assignment of time budgets, this propose DP-base algorithms to solve this problem. © 2015 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The aim of the paper is to define a remit of interest for design and designers in the field of products and services employing human face as an interface with users. From the point of view of design culture, humanoid artifacts, are at the intersection of product design, visual communication, and interaction design. The release of open hardware platforms, such as Arduino Robot, as well as the diffusion of fabrication laboratories (fablabs) and open design practices are the early manifestations of a wider interest toward social robotics accompanied by the possibility of building working prototypes of humanoid artifacts. The use of human face as interface in human–computer interaction adds analogic content to interaction processes in an unmediated and unobtrusive way, transferring human-computer interaction to the field of interpersonal communication. Nevertheless, the field of anthropomorphic artifacts is generally neglected by designers and rather controlled by engineers and experimental psychologists. Starting from a definition and taxonomy of humanoid artifacts, the aim of this chapter is to describe the paradigm of human-computer interaction through case studies of humanoid artifacts and to define criteria for the evaluation of humanoid artifacts from the perspective of design practice. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

The main objective of the paper is to analyses the performance of an open controller and the corresponding hardware. The overall control is done by open software developed in Linux. The machine operation is tested by sending a sample data written in G-code to a two axis CNC lathe, retrofitted with open hardware and interfacing to LinuxCNC operating system. The machine input commands issued by the LinuxCNC are interpreted by the motion control card and trajectory control signals are generated.These signals are converted to motor drive pulses by an FPGA module. The I/O signal generated by the FPGA module is fed to the AC servo motors using servo drives. The motion control card communicates with the LinuxCNC based personal computer using PCIExpress bus. That will assist the machine tool designers to develop a more flexible and versatile open system and help the end users to reconfigure and restructure the system as per their own requirement at lower cost. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) as an infrastructure comprised of sensing, computing and communication elements are designed for the decentralized recording of environmental information. If the matter of concern is referenced geospatial information this in particular forms a Geo Sensor Network (GSN).
Recently there is an ongoing extensive impact of these new techniques on all geo sciences, whereby it depends on the application which demands with respect to data quality, size and costs of the sensor nodes, number of nodes in the network, requirements of the communication component (coverage, data throughput) and the power management are relevant. In Engineering Geodesy the new possibilities and new ideas emerging from GSN especially concern geo(detic) monitoring of objects like landslides or engineering construction sites. Theory and possibilities of GSN technology as well as some selected aspects for geo monitoring in particular will be discussed. As the early detection of already small variations is essential for Early Warning Systems (EWS) and risk management, data quality and reliability is of utmost importance. Thus, customary utilization of low cost equipment in such a GSN generally requires for calibration procedures and higher sophisticated evaluation concepts in order to provide meaningful results. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Cyber Security classes are not offered in many colleges and fewer high schools, the main reason is that there are not enough resources in terms of both expertise and equipment for them to start a Cyber Security education program. We are seeking to reduce the overhead cost for offering such classes by developing a system that is cloud-based which will enable students to participate in labs from their school while only needing an internet connection and low-end computers. We are in the process of developing such a cloud system at the University of Washington Bothell and the tool that will generate a working network on the fly with either a probabilistic model or the specific instructions from the user via a network description language. These dynamically generated systems will then be instantiated on the cloud system along with progress monitoring applications that will determine when the student has completed the scenario. Since all of the heavy processing is done on the cloud-side, the school offering such a class only needs to have very basic, low-cost hardware to connect to the remote system, deploy the scenario, and participate in the scenario. We are currently working with the Yakama Nation to deploy a lab for their students to utilize our system. We will initially begin by holding cyber security workshops for the students and then, pending positive results, move to a more regular class-like format, these classes will be designed around teaching through interaction and hands on experience rather than the formal lecture style to help cultivate the ability to think outside the box which is much needed from todays security.},

abstract={Photographic documentation and image-based wound assessment is frequently performed in medical diagnostics, patient care, and clinical research. To support quantitative assessment, photographic imaging is based on expensive and high-quality hardware and still needs appropriate registration and calibration. Using inexpensive consumer hardware such as smartphone-integrated cameras, calibration of geometry, color, and contrast is challenging. Some methods involve color calibration using a reference pattern such as a standard color card, which is located manually in the photographs. In this paper, we adopt the lattice detection algorithm by Park et al. from real world to medicine. At first, the algorithm extracts and clusters feature points according to their local intensity patterns. Groups of similar points are fed into a selection process, which tests for suitability as a lattice grid. The group which describes the largest probability of the meshes of a lattice is selected and from it a template for an initial lattice cell is extracted. Then, a Markov random field is modeled. Using the mean-shift belief propagation, the detection of the 2D lattice is solved iteratively as a spatial tracking problem. Least-squares geometric calibration of projective distortions and non-linear color calibration in RGB space is supported by 35 corner points of 24 color patches, respectively. The method is tested on 37 photographs taken from the German Calciphylaxis registry, where non-standardized photographic documentation is collected nationwide from all contributing trial sites. In all images, the reference card location is correctly identified. At least, 28 out of 35 lattice points were detected, outperforming the SIFT-based approach previously applied. Based on these coordinates, robust geometry and color registration is performed making the photographs comparable for quantitative analysis. © 2015 SPIE.},

These designs target a total parts cost of below USD $5,000. This design will be made publically available to facilitate its use by others, with or without modification. A ‘side slotted’ CubeSat design (where main circuit boards are placed in slots between the rails on the outside) has been developed for OpenOrbiter. This paper discusses the design choices that were made during the mechanical structure development of the OpenOrbiter CubeSat design, required to keep it within the mass, volume and monetary budgets. Choices like the design of the aluminum support structure, fastener mechanisms, circuit board layout and science package support structure are all discussed and their ease of construction and efficacy are considered. A discussion of ongoing work on the spacecraft’s mechanical fabrication and other subsystems is also presented. The paper also discusses how the design can, prospectively, be utilized by others and the ‘bigger picture’ benefits provided by the design approach and open hardware concept. © 2015 by Benjamin Kading, Jeremy Straub and Ronald Marsh.},

abstract={Laboratory practices are very important activities in BSc (Bachelor of Science) and MSc (Master of Science) engineering courses involving concepts of Measurement Science, because they give to both undergraduate and graduate students the unique opportunity to verify with hands-on experiences the arguments introduced in theoretical lessons. Today there are truly uncountable different possible hardware/software low cost choices available for University teaching which could be complementary or alternative to the commonly used teaching tools (LabVIEW®, MATLAB®, etc.). In effects, the use of open-source and open-hardware platforms can offer different advantages with respect to traditional ones; first, they assure a bottom-up approach, which guarantees a pleasant and constructive learning with a gradual comprehension of concepts from the simple ones to more complex ones. Then, these cheap and readily available platforms permit to verify (also at home) the theoretical concepts and the proposed exercises with low cost devices rather than with expensive ones. Finally, the learning outcomes of the basic courses are indispensable to advanced courses where sensors, wireless networking and embedded systems converge, encouraging students to explore and realize new applications, preparing them for successful careers as engineers. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={The lack of accessible quality healthcare is one of the biggest problems in Africa and other developing countries. This is not only due to the unavailability of resources, but also to the absence of a structured formative process for the design and management of healthcare facilities. Crucial to the effective and efficient exploitation of healthcare facilities and biomedical technology is the support of Biomedical engineers, who form the link between technology and medical practice. Indeed Biomedical engineers, together with nurses and doctors, form the pillars of healthcare systems in the developed world. In this paper, the Open Source for BioMedical Engineering (OS4BME) project and its kick off summer school are presented. The OS4BME project aims at developing a new generation of biomedical engineers, able to exploit emerging technologies generated by the recent "Makers" revolution. During the one week summer school, students from various sub-Saharan countries were introduced to these new design, development and sharing paradigms. Students worked together to identify new simple biomedical devices, which could help in daily clinical practice in their countries. A cheap and easy-to-use neonatal monitoring device was chosen as a Crowd design project. The OS4BME Baby Monitor was designed and assembled by the students during the one week summer school, demonstrating the creative potential of the new generation of biomedical engineers empowered with the paradigms of crowdsourcing and rapid prototyping. © 2015 by authors.},

Incompatibility of devices and protocols (usually proprietary devices and protocols) are one of the major hurdles to be overcome to realise the Internet of Things (IoT) vision. IoT devices are typically constrained devices and this creates dependencies between the hardware, software and protocols used in the device. Open hardware and software platforms to support emerging IoT trends are required. A wireless sensor network gateway was developed in a three-month period using off-the-shelf components. The gateway was based on the Raspberry PI single-board computer; it implemented 6LoWPAN mesh and wireless access point functionality for mobile and low power sensing and actuation devices. The gateway was tested in the following use-case: integrate a battery-operated 6LoWPAN-enabled smart water meter to an IPv6 building network. Several factors that influence the gateway's performance and reliability were identified and should be considered when deploying gateway devices for future endeavours. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is an effective technique for diagnosing the behaviour of electrochemical devices such as batteries and fuel cells, usually by fitting data to an equivalent circuit model (ECM). The common approach in the laboratory is to measure the impedance spectrum of a cell in the frequency domain using a single sine sweep signal, then fit the ECM parameters in the frequency domain. This paper focuses instead on estimation of the ECM parameters directly from time-domain data. This may be advantageous for parameter estimation in practical applications such as automotive systems including battery-powered vehicles, where the data may be heavily corrupted by noise. The proposed methodology is based on the simplified refined instrumental variable for continuous-time fractional systems method ('srivcf'), provided by the Crone toolbox [1,2], combined with gradient-based optimisation to estimate the order of the fractional term in the ECM. The approach was tested first on synthetic data and then on real data measured from a 26650 lithium-ion iron phosphate cell with low-cost equipment. The resulting Nyquist plots from the time-domain fitted models match the impedance spectrum closely (much more accurately than when a Randles model is assumed), and the fitted parameters as separately determined through a laboratory potentiostat with frequency domain fitting match to within 13%. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The prime objective of any technological innovation is to improve the life of people. Technological innovation in the field of medical devices directly touches the lives of millions of people; not just patients but doctors and other technicians as well. Serving these care givers is serving humanity. Growth of Mobil Devices and Cloud Computing has changed the way we live and work. We try to bring the benefits of these technological innovations to the medical field via equipment which can improve the working efficiencies and capabilities of the medical professionals and technicians. The improvements in the camera and image processing capabilities of the Mobile Devices coupled with their improved processing power and an infinite processing and storage offered by Cloud Computing infrastructure opens up a window of opportunity to use them in the specialized field like microsurgery. To enable microsurgery, surgeons use optical microscope to zoom into the working area to get better visibility and control. However, these devices suffer from various drawbacks and are not comfortable to use. We build a Tablet with large stereoscopic screen allowing glasses free 3D display enabled by cameras capable of capturing 3D video and enhanced by an image processing pipeline, greatly improves the visibility and viewing comfort of the surgeon. Moreover using the capabilities of Cloud computing, these surgeries can be recorded and streamed live for education, training and consultation. An expert sitting in a geographically remote location can guide the surgeon performing the surgery. All vital parameters of the patient undergoing surgery can be shown as an overlay on the Tablet screen so that the surgeon is alerted of any parameter going beyond limit. Developing this kind of complex device involves engineering skills in hardware and software and huge amount of investments in terms of time, resources and money. To accelerate the development, we make use of open source hardware and software and demonstrate how we can accelerate the development using these open source resources. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={A Cognitive Radio is a Software Defined Radio (SDR). The Cognitive radio network is capable to sense and analyze its surrounding environment as well as reconfigure its operation in accordance with this radio environment. In this way, based on the available Channel State Information (CSI), the cognitive radio network may dynamically access the spectrum. MIMO based cognitive radio system enabled dynamically simultaneous usage of a radio spectrum for this beam forming signal processing technique is used. Beam forming is a technique in which the directionality of transmission and reception of radio signals can be controlled. Modern wireless technology depends on beam forming technology in order to provide higher data rates, improved coverage and also used to share the spectrum with the other users. Hardware complexity is one of the main issue in MIMO based wireless system which require N number of RF chains for N antenna systems. Antenna sub array formation (ASF) scheme is an optimization technique which can be used to reduce the RF chain required such a way the capacity can be improved. This will reduce the cost of the hardware much and we can realize low cost hardware system. Usually the two process of sub array formation and beam forming are done as separate process but in this paper the joint beam forming and sub array formation is done such a way the secondary user capacity will be improved and to avoid two computational complex process. Antenna sub array formation (ASF) scheme is employed to maximize the Signal to Interference Ratio (SINR) by using all antenna elements. In Antenna sub array formation the Radio Frequency chain is allocated to sub array of elements. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Attitude measurement performance onboard aeronautical transport platforms is a key issue to enanche mission capabilities of current systems. Indeed, the standard attitude measurement accuracy FAA requirements, i.e. 1° rms for pitch and roll and 3° rms for heading, are intended for typical mission profiles that where adopted in the past. Currently, developing aeronautical platforms, such as Unmanned Aircraft Systems and Personal Aircraft, require increased performance in terms of attitude determination that must be realized by exploiting low-cost hardware. This performance will support the installation of directional strapdown observation sensors, such as radars and cameras, and the development of advanced integrated navigation systems. As a matter of fact, using accurate inertial units with aiding sensor increases the length of inertial coasting and improves the overall accuracy. In recent years, a new generation of MEMS gyros has been made available. These sensors attain the tactical level, i.e. they have a bias instability better than 1°/h, which is the level that allows for self inizialization of heading. In the past, only fiber optic sensor were capable to attain this level of accuracy. This performance has been gained by exploiting innovative sensor configurations and by increasing the level of accuracy in sensor manufacturing. As a consequence, new functions can be added to low-cost platforms such as adopting integrated navigation architecture based on magnetometer-less configurations and attaining 0.1° rms attitude determination accuracy about each axis. This performance permits the installation of highly directive payloads. This paper presents the development and testing of an inertial unit based on advanced MEMS gyros that meets the above mentioned performance. Moreover, all processing steps from initial architecture design to field testing will be presented.

abstract={The purpose of this study was to fine-tune the step test protocol to accurately assess VO2 max in athletes comparable to the use of standard gas-exchange maximal metabolic exercise testing methods. As such, then, VO2 max tests can be economically carried out by using low cost equipment with a simple and reliable test protocol at the convenience of coaches and athletes. A pilot study was carried out with 6 subjects to determine the effect of various parameters that influence the accuracy of the typical step test protocol. The parameters included age, body weight, body height, leg length, thigh length, step height, hip joint angle, knee joint angle, stepping tempo, test duration, and heart rate (HR) immediately at the end of the test duration, to recovery HR resulting in 16 different testing protocols to benchmark against the conventional 3-Minute Step Test, the Cycle Ergometer Test, and the standard gas-exchange method. Then, to fine-tune the step test protocol, a second study was carried out with 32 subjects sampled from university level male basketball players (aged 18 to 25) with a VO2 max of 47 to 65 mL·kg-1·min-1 (assessed by the gas-exchange method). The testing protocols consisted of six competing protocols. An incremental height of 1 cm resolution step box was developed to accurately accommodate a hip joint of 73° and a knee joint of 90° for different subjects' height test. Stepwise linear regression indicated that the most accurate step test protocol with respect to the gas-exchange method was the one with an individualized step box height that achieved the knee joint angle of 90°, 30 steps·min-1, and HR measured by a HR monitor at the end of the 3-min test duration. The resultant VO2 max assessments were more accurate than the 3-Minute Step Test and the conventional Cycle Ergometer Test.},

abstract={Safety-critical systems and certification standards are the bare essential elements for the development process of avionics, automotive and industrial embedded systems. The necessity of including non-safety capabilities to reduce the price of these systems has resulted in a new type of critical systems, the mixed-criticality ones. These systems should be able to execute safety-critical applications but, at the same time, to run non-safety-critical functionalities without affecting the integrity of the safety-critical tasks. This paper presents a new system architecture which includes safety- critical and non-safety-critical parts in order to form a mixed-criticality system. The system consists of a reliable platform with a dual-core processor (implemented using a FPGA) architecture designed as open-hardware, running two isolated real time oper ating systems which are connected through a safe core-to-core communication channel that executes the safety-critical applications. Moreover, the safety-critical system is connected to an external processor, an ARM9, which is used as an external sensing system. The ARM9 runs the non-safety-critical applications and allows the system to insert modifications updating without affecting the safety capabilities of the safety- critical part. This platform is described providing evidences of the isolation between safety-critical (SC) and non-safety-critical (NSC) applications, as well as describing an updating methodology for non-safety-critical applications. This system is validated using a complete and reliable application for safe emergency stop applications for in- dustrial machinery. © J.UCS.},

abstract={Technological devices of all kinds are becoming more common in our daily lives: smart devices are being incorporated in buildings, houses, cars, and public infrastructure such as roads and bridges. The new devices give us an unusual degree of connectivity in our regular activities, for example when we employ our tablets or smart phones to check email or browse the public network, but also in more innovative forms of connectivity, such as receiving notifications directly from our refrigerator or collecting information from our clothes and shoes. This technological revolution brings new opportunities and challenges for users, businesses, and society. This paper explores such a new context, where we begin to co-exist and interact with a network of interconnected devices that is known as the Internet of Things. The objective of the project is to implement a solution for communicating devices that monitor, in real-time, the structural health of a bridge. The implementation is based on 6LoWPAN, a standard based on the IPv6 protocol over low-power and lossy networks to support the Internet of Things. We employ open hardware platforms and emphasize the singularities of embedded systems, such as a limited number of operations, low power consumption, and low bandwidth capability. The prototype shown in this work uses the 6LoWPAN standard in a network environment that connects with a real Bridge Management System, with the aim of optimizing the maintenance of road structures. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Introduction: Emergency physicians are among the few specialists besides ophthalmologists who commonly perform ophthalmologic examinations using the slit lamp and other instruments. However, most medical schools in the United States do not require an ophthalmology rotation upon completion. Teaching procedural skills to medical students can be challenging due to limited resources and instructor availability. Our study assesses the effectiveness of a 40-minute hands-on teaching session on ophthalmologic examination for medical students using only two instructors and low-cost equipment. Methods: We performed an interventional study using a convenience sample of subjects. Pre-and post-workshop questionnaires on students' confidence in performing ophthalmologic examination were administered. We used a paired t-test and Wilcoxon rank test to analyze the data. Results: Of the 30 participants in the study, the mean age was 25 and the majority were first-year medical students. The students' confidence in performing every portion of the ophthalmologic exam increased significantly after the teaching session. We found that the average confidence level before the teaching session were below 2 on a 1-5 Likert scale (1 being the least confident). Confidence levels in using the slit lamp had the highest improvement among the skills taught (2.17 95% CI [1.84-2.49]). Students reported the least improvement in their confidence in assessing extraocular movements (0.73, 95% CI [0.30-1.71]) and examining pupillary function (0.73, 95% CI [0.42-1.04]). We observed the biggest difference in median confidence level in the use of the tonometer (4 with a p-value of <0.05). Conclusion: A 40-minute structured hands-on training session can significantly improve students' confidence levels in ophthalmologic skills. © 2015 by the article author(s).},

abstract={In 2015 NASA plans to launch a payload to 280 Km altitude on a sounding rocket from the Wallops Flight Facility. This payload will contain several novel technologies that work together to demonstrate methodologies for space sample return missions and for nanosatellite communications in general. The payload will deploy and test an Exo-Brake, which slows the payload aerodynamically, providing eventual de-orbit and recovery of future ISS samples through a Small Payload Quick Return project. In addition, this flight addresses future Mars mission entry technology, space-to-space communications using the Iridium Short Messaging Service (SMS), GPS tracking, and wireless sensors using the ZigBee protocol. SOAREX-8 is being assembled and tested at Ames Research Center (ARC) and the NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC) is funding sensor and communications work. Open source Arduino technology and software are used for system control. The ZigBee modules used are XBee units that connect analog sensors for temperature, air pressure and acceleration measurement wirelessly to the payload telemetry system. Our team is developing methods for power distribution and module mounting, along with software for sensor integration, data assembly and downlink. We have demonstrated relaying telemetry to the ground using the Iridium satellite constellation on a previous flight, but the upcoming flight will be the first time we integrate useful flight test data from a ZigBee wireless sensor network. Wireless sensor data will measure the aerodynamic efficacy of the Exo-Brake permitting further onorbit flight tests of improved designs. The Exo-Brake is 5 m2 in area and will be stored in a container and deployed during ascent once the payload is jettisoned from the launch vehicle. We intend to further refine the hardware and continue testing on balloon launches, future sounding rocket flights and on nanosatellite missions. The use of standards-based and opensource hardware/software has allowed for this project to be completed with a very modest budget and a challenging schedule. There is a wealth of hardware and software available for both the Arduino platform and the XBee, all low-cost or open-source. Along with the Exo-Brake hardware and deployment discussion, this paper will describe in detail the system architecture emphasizing the successful use of opensource hardware and software to minimize effort and cost. Testing procedures, radio frequency interference (RFI) mitigation, success criteria and expected results will also be discussed. The use of Iridium short messaging capability for space-to-space links, standards-based wireless sensor networks, and other innovative communications technology are also presented. © 2015 IEEE.},

METHODS: For fabrication of the pressure sensors, the FBGs are embedded within layers of carbon composite material and stacked in an arc shape. From this embedding technique, average pressure sensitivity of 1.3 pm/kPa and resolution of nearly 0.8 kPa is obtained. These sensors are found to be suitable for measuring the static and the low-speed walk generated foot pressure. Simultaneously, PZT patches of size 10 × 10 × 0.3 mm were used as sensors, utilizing the d33 (thickness) coupling mode. A sensitivity of 7.06 mV/kPa and a pressure resolution of 0.14 kPa is obtained from these sensors, which are found to be suitable for foot pressure measurement during high speed walking and running. Both types of sensors are attached to the underside of the sole of commercially available shoes. In the experiments, a healthy male subject walks/runs over the treadmill wearing the fabricated shoes at various speeds and the peak pressure is measured using both the sensors. Commercially available low-cost hardware is used for interrogation of the two sensor types. RESULTS: The test results clearly show the feasibility of the FBG and the PZT sensors for measurement of plantar pressure. The PZT sensors are more accurate for measurement of pressure during walking at high speeds. The FBG sensors, on the other hand, are found to be suitable for static and quasi-dynamic (slow walking) conditions. Typically, the measured pressure varied from 400 to 600 kPa below the forefoot and 100 to 1000 kPa below the heel as the walking speed varied from 1 kilometer per hour (kmph) to 7 kmph. CONCLUSIONS: When instrumented in combination, the two sensors can enable measurements ranging from static to high speed conditions Both the sensor types are rugged, small sized and can be easily embedded in commercial shoes and enable plantar pressure measurement in a cost-effective manner. This research is expected to have application in the treatment of patients suffering from diabetes and gonarthrosis. © 2015-IOS Press and the authors.},

abstract={Introduction: Advanced video technology is available for sleep-laboratories. However, low-cost equipment for screening in the home setting has not been identified and tested, nor has a methodology for analysis of video recordings been suggested. Methods: We investigated different combinations of hardware/software for home-videosomnography (HVS) and established a process for qualitative and quantitative analysis of HVS-recordings. A case vignette (HVS analysis for a 5.5-year-old girl with major insomnia and several co-morbidities) demonstrates how methodological considerations were addressed and how HVS added value to clinical assessment. Results: We suggest an "ideal set of hardware/software" that is reliable, affordable (~$500) and portable (=2.8 kg) to conduct non-invasive HVS, which allows time-lapse analyses. The equipment consists of a net-book, a camera with infrared optics, and a video capture device. (1) We present an HVS-analysis protocol consisting of three steps of analysis at varying replay speeds: (a) basic overview and classification at 16× normal speed; (b) second viewing and detailed descriptions at 4-8× normal speed, and (c) viewing, listening, and in-depth descriptions at real-time speed. (2) We also present a custom software program that facilitates video analysis and note-taking (Annotator.© ), and Optical Flow software that automatically quantifies movement for internal quality control of the HVS-recording. The case vignette demonstrates how the HVS-recordings revealed the dimension of insomnia caused by restless legs syndrome, and illustrated the cascade of symptoms, challenging behaviors, and resulting medications. Conclusion: The strategy of using HVS, although requiring validation and reliability testing, opens the floor for a new "observational sleep medicine, "which has been useful in describing discomfort-related behavioral movement patterns in patients with communication difficulties presenting with challenging/disruptive sleep/wake behaviors. © 2015 Ipsiroglu, Hung, Chan, Ross, Veer, Soo, Ho, Berger, McAllister, Garn, Kloesch, Barbosa, Stockler, McKellin and Vatikiotis-Bateson.},

abstract={The Distributed Ground Station Network (DGSN) is a proposed global network of small ground stations for automatic tracking of satellites. With a minimum of five ground stations receiving a satellite's beacon signal, the position of the signal's origin can be determined using precise GNSS (GPS, Galileo) reception times and communicating over the internet or other networks. In other words, a "reverse GPS" system. The project is designed to be a low budget, citizen science project. The cost of individual ground stations hardware should be no more than 100 euros. The DGSN mission goal is to provide an open tracking and communication service to satellite operators who needs a global, permanent and free access to their satellite's position, telemetry and payload data. The tracking is especially important during, and a few weeks after, a launch of several satellites from one rocket before other TLE-sources are updated. The focus lies on small and CubeSats due to their uncertain "take what you got" orbit of the launch provider. In collaboration with the original project by AerospaceResearch.net conducted at the University of Stuttgart, the DGSN Trondheim Student Project at the Norwegian University of Science and Technol ogy (NTNU) has made use of off-the-shelf, low cost hardware to set up a ground station for receiving and analyzing satellite signals in the UHF and VHF band. Using a simple, but broadband (50 MHz to 2 GHz), DVB-T radio receiver as a software-defined radio platform, the focus of our project has been in demonstrating receiving actual signals from satellites. Previous tests have focused on trilateration of signals from stationary sources such as radio towers, but it is imperative that receiving signals from the satellites themselves using simple antennas is possible. In light of this, it was necessary to calculate the theoretical possibility of re ceiving satellite signals using simple wide searching antennas. Furthermore, creating software for processing and interpreting the signals, and putting our calculations to the test by conducting real world experiments with the receivers. In this paper, we discuss mission drivers for a globally distributed ground station network and the citizen science limitations on budgets and COTS technologies of such a single ground station design. The emphasis is on the link budget and the process of finding a suitable antenna which can receive the desired signals, mainly from CubeSat projects. At NTNU, the base station is set up in co-operation with the the NUTS CubeSat. Copyright © 2015 by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) became popular platforms for the collection of remotely sensed geodata in the last years (Hardin & Jensen 2011). Various applications in numerous fields of research like archaeology (Hendrickx et al. 2011), forestry or geomorphology evolved (Martinsanz 2012). This contribution deals with the generation of very high resolution multi-temporal Crop Surface Models (CSM) for rice growth monitoring by means of low-cost equipment. The concept of the generation of multi-temporal CSM using terrestrial Laserscanning (TLS) has already been introduced by Hoffmeister et al. (2010). For this study, data acquisition was performed with a low-cost and low-weight Mini-UAV (< 5 kg). UAV in general and especially smaller ones, like the system presented here, close a gap in small scale remote sensing (Berni et al. 2009, Watts et al. 2012). In precision agriculture frequent remote sensing on such scales during the vegetation period provides important spatial information on the crop status. Crop growth variability can be detected by comparison of the CSM in different phenological stages. In this contribution, the method, that has already been used for barley (Bendig et al. 2013), is applied to a different crop in a different environment. The study area is an experiment field for rice in Northeast China (Sanjiang Plain). Two rice cultivars were planted and treated with different amounts of N-fertilizer. In July 2012 three UAV-campaigns were carried out. Additionally, further destructive and non-destructive field data were collected. The UAV-system is an MK-Okto by Hisystems (www.mikrokopter.de) equipped with a high resolution optical consumer camera. The self-built and self-maintained system has a payload of up to 1 kg and 15 minutes mean endurance and can be operated up to a wind speed of less than 19 km/h. Stereo images were captured at a flying height of 50 m and a 44% side and 90% forward overlap. The images are processed into CSM under the use of the Structure from Motion (SfM)-based software Agisoft Photoscan 0.9.0. The resulting models have a resolution of 0.02 m. Further data processing in Esri ArcGIS allows for quantitative comparison of the plant heights. The multi-temporal datasets are analysed on a plot size basis. The results can be compared to and combined with the additional field data. Detecting plant height with non-invasive measurement techniques enables analysis of its correlation to biomass and other crop parameters (Hansen & Schjoerring 2003, Thenkabail et al. 2000) measured in the field. The method presented here can therefore be a valuable addition for the recognition of such correlations.},

abstract={In the last decades drop-on-demand inkjet technology played an increasing role in industrial and medical applications. This is due to the ability to deposit a small amount of material in precisely defined position. In the field of Biofabrication, inkjet printers are used to build 2D and 3D scaffolds and gels with biological molecules, including living cells. Several works, including seminal papers on inkjet bioprinting, were carried out with modified office printers. These printers have fixed structural characteristics and operating size, especially on the print-head, limiting the range of materials that can be dispensed. The aim of the present work is the design and fabrication of an open-source piezoelectric inkjet print-head, optimized for the bioprinting field. This low-cost, reproducible, reliable, versatile and biocompatible device will enable various research laboratories to work with a shared device; the open source allowing for parts to be modified to suit specific needs. The design was carried out by Finite Element (FE) modeling of the piezoelectric, mechanical, fluid dynamics and their coupling. The design was optimized for shear rate, which we minimized in order to be able to print cells. The mechanical frame of the printer was designed and built using a low-cost 3D printer. The nozzle plate was fabricated from a polycarbonate disc coated with biocompatible silicone, to increase the hydrophobicity of the outer surface of the disc, preventing ink adhesion on the edge of the nozzle; the refilling system, and the electronic control were also part of the project and will be freely available to download. The FE models were validated with ad-hoc experiments, printing water, gelatin solution, and cell culture media, by modulating the wave power in amplitude, frequency and duty cycle. The tests showed a large working window both respect to viscosity and to surface tension. Finally Human Skin Fibroblasts (ATCC-CRL-2522, Teddington UK), suspended in culture media, were printed. Cell viability, assessed by CellTiter-Blue and LIVE / DEAD tests, resulted comparable with the control, demonstrating the validity of the first open source piezoelectric inkjet print-head for biofabrication. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={There are many potential applications in the utilities, critical infrastructure monitoring and control and environmental monitoring. This article charts the device-level technologies used in the creation the IoT, including hardware, software and communications. IoT's emergence coincided with the development of radio frequency identification (RFID) technology offering advantages such as the communicable range, ability to write data to a tag, and the possibility of reading multiple tags more efficiently with a single reader. RFID is now just one of many component IoT technologies. We have arrived at a situation where it is practically trivial to integrate computation and communication into any manufactured thing, and it is equally feasible to connect and technologically perceive natural things using communicable sensors. Furthermore, it is possible to react to, and control the environment using embedded computing devices coupled with actuators. Thorough comprehension of functional and non-functional requirements is necessary to develop an effective, efficient design specification for an IoT device. But given the large design space and complexity, there are numerous barriers to entry. As a result, many types of device have been adopted as practical de facto hardware development platforms across research communities, anc hacker and maker communities. In each case, intermediary 'operating systems', designed to simplify their programming by masking hardware complexity, are typically used. Their technical specifications are often not fully disclosed, but they do rely on well- defined standards to ensure the necessary interoperability. The majority of devices are characterised as single board computers. The final design for a market-ready product will likely be as efficient and cost-effective as possible in terms of design, but include sufficient redundancy to support software updates and potential shifts in standards. Since the early 2000s, the wireless sensor network community has worked with highly constrained devices characterised by limited energy, storage, communications, packet loss, etc. Incremental improvement! to hardware components have led to net energy efficiency improvements, increased computation for equivalent or less energy, more storage, etc. Algorithms and protocol! have been developed to further improve efficiency and reliability. The 'maker' movements have focused on open source hardware whereas those on the educationa side have sought to reduce the barriers to entry in terms of cost and simplification, e.g. the Raspberry Pi. Industrialists have increasingly tended to incorporate monitoring systems into their operations. Cellular connectivity has also been adopted and both are now converging on IoT. Although wireless connectivity has been central to the development of many IoT standards, devices with wired connections can also be part of the IoT. Indeed, many standards relevant to IoT are designed independent of the particular physical communications medium enabling seamless interoperability at higher layers and easing connectivity concerns in integrated applications. A number of approaches exist to developing software for IoT devices. As the computing power available increases, the ease with which one may programme the device tends to improve. The fewer resources that are available, the closer the software developer must get to the hardware. To reduce the complexity of programming devices, operating systems and associated programming languages have been designed or adapted to suit the embedded environment. Considering the more computationally powerful single board computers, certain flavours of Linux have been developed. High-end boards with significant processing capabilities are capable of running full-blown operating systems. Recently, mobile operating systems, such as Android, have been used, and stripped down versions have been touted by the big developers. From a devices perspective, it is easier than ever to connect a sensor, a controller, or a mundane household item to the Internet. On the other hand, there are still significant challenges to be overcome. With regard to industrial applications with strict performance requirements, multiple constraints, and often-difficult operational environments, work is far from complete.},

abstract={Although photometric stereo offers an attractive technique for acquiring 3D data using low-cost equipment, inherent limitations in the methodology have served to limit its practical application, particularly in measurement or metrology tasks. Here we address this issue. Traditional photometric stereo assumes that lighting directions at every pixel are the same, which is not usually the case in real applications, and especially where the size of object being observed is comparable to the working distance. Such imperfections of the illumination may make the subsequent reconstruction procedures used to obtain the 3D shape of the scene prone to low frequency geometric distortion and systematic error (bias). Also, the 3D reconstruction of the object results in a geometric shape with an unknown scale. To overcome these problems a novel method of estimating the distance of the object from the camera is developed, which employs photometric stereo images without using other additional imaging modality. The method firstly identifies Lambertian diffused maxima region to calculate the object distance from the camera, from which the corrected per-pixel light vector is able to be derived and the absolute dimensions of the object can be subsequently estimated. We also propose a new calibration process to allow a dynamic(as an object moves in the field of view) calculation of light vectors for each pixel with little additional computation cost. Experiments performed on synthetic as well as real data demonstrates that the proposed approach offers improved performance, achieving a reduction in the estimated surface normal error of up to 45% as well as mean height error of reconstructed surface of up to 6 mm. In addition, when compared to traditional photometric stereo, the proposed method reduces the mean angular and height error so that it is low, constant and independent of the position of the object placement within a normal working range. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={This chapter examines the use of Open Source Software (OSS) technologies that can be used to improve the learning of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). Explored are the various methods that can be utilized to improve the percentage of STEM majors in the American educational system with resources such as: Open Source as Alternative (OSALT), virtualization, cloud computing, Linux distributions, open source programming, and open source hardware platforms. Increasing the amount of students that pursue STEM majors is important because the projected job growth in the STEM field compared to non-STEM jobs is 33%. OSALT provides cost-effective alternatives to commercial products such as Microsoft Office Suite and Adobe Photoshop. Second, creating Virtual Machines (VMs) is another avenue to teach complex concepts in computer science, engineering, and Information Technology (IT). Third, cloud computing is an inexpensive way for clients to access information from multiple locations and devices. Fourth, universities can use the Operating System (OS) Linux and its various distributions as replacements for commercial operating systems like Windows in order to reduce IT costs. Lastly, open source programming languages like Python and their associated Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provide comprehensive facilities for software engineers for application development or testing. © 2015, IGI Global.

abstract={Over the last twenty years, positioning with low cost Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) sensors have rapidly developed around the world at both a commercial and academic research level. For many years these instruments have only acquired the GPS constellation but are now able to track the Global’naja Navigacionnaja Sputnikovaja Sistema (GLONASS) constellation. This characteristic is very interesting, especially if used in hard-urban environments or in hard conditions where satellite visibility is low. The goal of this research is to investigate the contribution of the GLONASS constellation for mass-market receivers in order to analyse the performance in real time (Network Real Time Kinematic-NRTK positioning) with post-processing approaches. Under these conditions, it is possible to confirm that mass-market sensors could be a valid alternative to a more expensive receiver for a large number of surveying applications, but with low cost hardware the contribution of the GLONASS constellation for fixing ambiguities is useless, if not dangerous. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={The purpose of this article was to present a new drying method for agricultural products. Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) has been applied for drying of agricultural materials due to several advantages such as energy saving, low cost equipment, low drying temperatures, and superior material quality. To evaluate this method, an EHD dryer based on solar (photovoltaic) energy was designed and fabricated. Moreover, the optimum condition for the EHD drying of kiwi fruit was studied by applying the Box–Behnken design of response surface methodology. The desirability function was applied for optimization in case of single objective and multiobjective functions. By using the multiobjective optimization method, maximum desirability value of 0.865 was obtained based on the following: applied voltage of 15 kV, field strength of 5.2 kV cm−1, without forced air stream, and finally a combination of 17 discharge electrodes (needles). The results indicated that increasing the applied voltage from 6 to 15 kV, moisture ratio (MR) decreased, though energy efficiency and energy consumption were increasing. On the other hand, field strength of 5.2 kV cm−1 was the optimal point in terms of MR. © 2014 The Authors. Food Science & Nutrition published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Monitoring soil water content at high spatio-temporal resolution and coupled to other sensor data is crucial for applications oriented towards water sustainability in agriculture, such as precision irrigation or phenotyping root traits for drought tolerance. The cost of instrumentation, however, limits measurement frequency and number of sensors. The objective of this work was to design a low cost ―open hardware‖ platform for multi-sensor measurements including water content at different depths, air and soil temperatures. The system is based on an open-source ARDUINO microcontroller-board, programmed in a simple integrated development environment (IDE). Low cost high-frequency dielectric probes were used in the platform and lab tested on three non-saline soils (ECe1: 2.5 &lt; 0.1 mS/cm). Empirical calibration curves were subjected to cross-validation (leave-one-out method), and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) were respectively 0.09 for the overall model, 0.09 for the sandy soil, 0.07 for the clay loam and 0.08 for the sandy loam. The overall model (pooled soil data) fitted the data very well (R2 = 0.89) showing a high stability, being able to generate very similar RMSEs during training and validation (RMSEtraining = 2.63; RMSEvalidation = 2.61). Data recorded on the card were automatically sent to a remote server allowing repeated field-data quality checks. This work provides a framework for the replication and upgrading of a customized low cost platform, consistent with the open source approach whereby sharing information on equipment design and software facilitates the adoption and continuous improvement of existing technologies. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Motion capture of the human body has being performed for decades with a growing number of technologies, aims and application fields; but only recent optical markerless technologies based on silhouette recognition and depth sensors which have been developed for videogames control interface have brought motion capture to a broad diffusion. Actually, nowadays there are low cost hardware and software suitable for a wide range of applications that may vary from entertainment domain (e.g., videogames, virtual characters in movies) to the biomechanical and biomedical domain (e.g., gait analysis or orthopedic rehabilitation) and to a huge number of industrial sectors. In this quick evolving scenario it is hard to tell which technology is the most suitable for any desired goal. The aim of the paper is to answer to this issue by presenting a benchmark analysis that compares RGB and RGB-D technologies used to track performing people in a variety of conditions. In order to contrast the solutions, several different tasks have been selected, simultaneously captured and post-processed exactly in the same way. The test campaign has been designed to evaluate pros and cons according to the most important feature of a motion capture technology, such as volume of acquisition, accuracy of joint position and tracking of fast movements. Actors were asked to perform a number of tasks, among which free movements of arms, legs and full body, gait, and tasks performed interacting with a machine. The number of sensors around the scene and their disposition have been considered as well. We used Sony PS Eye cameras and Microsoft Kinect sensors as hardware solutions and iPisoft for data elaboration. The gathered results are organized, compared and discussed stressing performances and limitations of any combination and, at last, we proposed the best candidate technology for some key applications. © 2014 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers.},

abstract={This paper proposed a novel methodology for the quantification of an artificial dye, sunset yellow (SY), in soft beverages, using image analysis (RGB histograms) and partial least squares regression. The developed method presented many advantages if compared with alternative methodologies, such as HPLC and UV/VIS spectrophotometry. It was faster, did not require sample pretreatment steps or any kind of solvents and reagents, and used a low cost equipment, a commercial flatbed scanner. This method was able to quantify SY in isotonic drinks and orange sodas, in the range of 7.8-39.7 mg L-1, with relative prediction errors lower than 10%. A multivariate validation was also performed according to the Brazilian and international guidelines. Linearity, accuracy, sensitivity, bias, prediction uncertainty and a recently proposed tool, the β-expectation tolerance intervals, were estimated. The application of digital images in food analysis is very promising, opening the possibility for automation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The rise of network speeds to tens of gigabits per second poses a challenge to develop packet processing applications that can cope with such bit rates. Therefore, the need for a suitable open source system that can be used as a prototype platform to test new network functionality while ensuring line-rate processing, accurate timestamping, and reduced power consumption has become evident. All these requirements cannot be achieved by using software-only solutions, but rather with hardware-based platforms such as NetFPGA. The main obstacle when using this type of open source FPGA-based solution is the cost of development, in both time and hardware development skills required. The spread of new circuit synthesis tools using high-level languages opens the door for the development of hardwarebased networking applications with reasonable development effort, compared to the use of traditional hardware description languages. In this article, we describe how existing open source hardware-based platforms for networking applications will be fueled by the change in the programming model of FPGAs provided by modern high-level synthesis tools. For this, we implemented a network flow monitor using high-level languages and compared the effort spent with respect to a traditional hardware development cycle. Preliminary results are very promising, given that development time is reduced from months to weeks. © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

Because of its nature, the photon propagation problem can be very easily parallelized and ran on low cost hardware, avoiding the need for expensive Super Computers. A comparison between Diffusion and MC photon propagation theory is presented in this work with application to neuroimaging, investigating low scattering regions in a mouse-like phantom. Regions such as the Cerebral Spinal Fluid, are currently not taken into account in the classical computational models because of the impossibility to accurately simulate light propagation using fast Diffusive Equation approaches, leading to inaccuracies during the reconstruction process. The goal of the study presented here, is to reduce and further improve the computation accuracy of the reconstructed solution in a highly realistic scenario in the case of neuroimaging in preclinical mouse models. © 2015 SPIE-OSA.},

abstract={Color measurements have traditionally been linked to expensive and difficult to handle equipment. The set of mathematical transformations that are needed to transfer a color that we observe in any object that doesn't emit its own light (which is usually called a color-object) so that it can be displayed on a computer screen or printed on paper is not at all trivial. This usually requires a thorough knowledge of color spaces, colorimetric transformations and color management systems. The TCS3414CS color sensor (I2C Sensor Color Grove), a system for capturing, processing and color management that allows the colors of any non-self-luminous object using a low-cost hardware based on Arduino, is presented in this paper. Specific software has been developed in Matlab and a study of the linearity of chromatic channels and accuracy of color measurements for this device has been undertaken. All used scripts (Arduino and Matlab) are attached as supplementary material. The results show acceptable accuracy values that, although obviously do not reach the levels obtained with the other scientific instruments, for the price difference they present a good low cost option. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Background: Functional electrical stimulation (FES) during repetitive practice of everyday tasks can facilitate recovery of upper limb function following stroke. Reduction in impairment is strongly associated with how closely FES assists performance, with advanced iterative learning control (ILC) technology providing precise upper-limb assistance. The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of extending ILC technology to control FES of three muscle groups in the upper limb to facilitate functional motor recovery post-stroke. Methods. Five stroke participants with established hemiplegia undertook eighteen intervention sessions, each of one hour duration. During each session FES was applied to the anterior deltoid, triceps, and wrist/finger extensors to assist performance of functional tasks with real-objects, including closing a drawer and pressing a light switch. Advanced model-based ILC controllers used kinematic data from previous attempts at each task to update the FES applied to each muscle on the subsequent trial. This produced stimulation profiles that facilitated accurate completion of each task while encouraging voluntary effort by the participant. Kinematic data were collected using a Microsoft Kinect, and mechanical arm support was provided by a SaeboMAS. Participants completed Fugl-Meyer and Action Research Arm Test clinical assessments pre- and post-intervention, as well as FES-unassisted tasks during each intervention session. Results: Fugl-Meyer and Action Research Arm Test scores both significantly improved from pre- to post-intervention by 4.4 points. Improvements were also found in FES-unassisted performance, and the amount of arm support required to successfully perform the tasks was reduced. Conclusions: This feasibility study indicates that technology comprising low-cost hardware fused with advanced FES controllers accurately assists upper limb movement and may reduce upper limb impairments following stroke. © 2014 Meadmore et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

The calibration and validation of the car measurements are performed using controlled field experiments and a comparison with an instrumented tower. The corrections required to remove the effects of the car motion are shown to be smaller and simpler than the corrections for research aircraft measurements. A car can therefore satisfactorily measure near-surface turbulence using relatively low-cost equipment. Other natural advantages of a car, such as the ability to drive on any road at any time of day or night and follow the terrain slope, as well as its low cost of operation, make it applicable to observations of a variety of flow regimes that cannot be achieved with the usual platforms, such as research aircraft or networks of flux towers. © 2014 Author(s).},

abstract={Coarse clastic sediments (boulders) on coastlines have seen a groundswell in geomorphic research interest over recent years, associated in part with the potential of boulder evidence for interpreting characteristics of high-energy wave processes. Yet, the fundamental property of boulder volume is normally difficult to measure accurately owing to complex clast morphology and irregular surface texture. To tackle this problem, this paper concentrates on creating precise, measurable and textured three-dimensional (3D) models of coastal boulders without physical contact with the object, based on multi-view image measurement techniques. This method has several advantages over traditional measurements that are inaccurate or alternative solutions using costly techniques such as terrestrial laser scanning. Our methods propose the use of low-cost equipment (digital cameras) that can be used in various coastal environments to easily acquire numerous images of the object of interest. Initial results can be rapidly assessed in the field for immediate quality control. Resulting 3D models, built from overlapping multi-view digital photographs, allow the reconstruction of realistic-looking and textured boulder surfaces. A particular interest in this task is the family of algorithms known as structure from motion (SFM). The work presents analysis of SFM techniques by examining 3D models of boulders observed at a coastal field site on Lu Dao Island in south-eastern Taiwan. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Increasing the amount of students that pursue STEM majors is important because the projected job growth in the STEM field compared to non-STEM jobs is 33%. OSALT provides cost-effective alternatives to commercial products such as Microsoft Office Suite and Adobe Photoshop. Second, creating Virtual Machines (VMs) is another avenue to teach complex concepts in computer science, engineering, and Information Technology (IT). Third, cloud computing is an inexpensive way for clients to access information from multiple locations and devices. Fourth, universities can use the Operating System (OS) Linux and its various distributions as replacements for commercial operating systems like Windows in order to reduce IT costs. Lastly, open source programming languages like Python and their associated Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provide comprehensive facilities for software engineers for application development or testing. © 2014 by IGI Global.

abstract={Background: The UK has one of the highest rates for deaths from fire and flames in children aged 0-14 years compared to other high income countries. Evidence shows that smoke alarms can reduce the risk of fire-related injury but little exists on their cost-effectiveness. We aimed to compare the cost effectiveness of different interventions for the uptake of 'functioning' smoke alarms and consequently for the prevention of fire-related injuries in children in the UK. Methods. We carried out a decision model-based probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis. We used a hypothetical population of newborns and evaluated the impact of living in a household with or without a functioning smoke alarm during the first 5 years of their life on overall lifetime costs and quality of life from a public health perspective. We compared seven interventions, ranging from usual care to more complex interventions comprising of education, free/low cost equipment giveaway, equipment fitting and/or home safety inspection. Results: Education and free/low cost equipment was the most cost-effective intervention with an estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £34,200 per QALY gained compared to usual care. This was reduced to approximately £4,500 per QALY gained when 1.8 children under the age of 5 were assumed per household. Conclusions: Assessing cost-effectiveness, as well as effectiveness, is important in a public sector system operating under a fixed budget restraint. As highlighted in this study, the more effective interventions (in this case the more complex interventions) may not necessarily be the ones considered the most cost-effective. © 2014 Saramago et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Background: Many neuroscience experiments rely on presenting stimuli and measuring participants' responses to these events. Often computer screens, speakers and keyboards are sufficient. However, these devices are not appropriate for some situations. For example, some studies present tactile or olfactory stimuli or brain stimulation. Likewise, keyboard buttons are not appropriate for use with vocal responses, small animals or individuals with motor impairments. New method: We describe StimSync, which simulates USB keyboard inputs, allowing use with most experimental software. StimSync can measure button presses, optical signals from magnetic resonance imaging systems, changes in ambient light (e.g. synchronizing intracranial electrography), and auditory events (a voice key). In addition to the USB keyboard mode (necessarily millisecond precision), StimSync can also be set to provide higher precision timing. This feature can be used to validate timing, ensuring event synchronization (e.g. auditory events, visual events, brain stimulation). In addition to recording inputs, StimSync provides seven digital outputs for controlling external devices. Finally, StimSync can record analog inputs; we illustrate how this can be used to evaluate the rise time for computer displays. Results: We observed outputs with a mean latency of 2.1. ms (sd=. 0.17. ms) and USB inputs with a mean latency of 2. ms (sd=. 0.54. ms). Comparison with existing method(s): StimSync statistically outperforms two professional solutions and numerically outperforms other devices described in the literature. Conclusions: StimSync (http://www.mccauslandcenter.sc.edu/CRNL/tools/stimsync) provides an open-source solution for controlling and validating neuroscience experiments. In addition to sharing the design, we have produced a batch of devices to demonstrate the market for professional implementations. © 2014.},

abstract={Turbidity is an internationally recognized criterion for assessing drinking water quality, because the colloidal particles in turbid water may harbor pathogens, chemically reduce oxidizing disinfectants, and hinder attempts to disinfect water with ultraviolet radiation. A turbidimeter is an electronic/optical instrument that assesses turbidity by measuring the scattering of light passing through a water sample containing such colloidal particles. Commercial turbidimeters cost hundreds or thousands of dollars, putting them beyond the reach of low-resource communities around the world. An affordable open-source turbidimeter based on a single light-to-frequency sensor was designed and constructed, and evaluated against a portable commercial turbidimeter. The final product, which builds on extensive published research, is intended to catalyze further developments in affordable water and sanitation monitoring. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Evolution of very low-cost hardware, viz. low-resolution CMOS cameras and microphones, facilitating the retrieval of multimedia content from the environment, has prompted the conception of wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs). Sensor nodes' energy consumption is still one of the main concerns while improving the network lifetime of the network and clustering has been proved an important tool in this regard. However, the directionally constrained sensing nature of nodes in one type of WMSN turned the routing solutions of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) inapplicable for WMSN. This paper proposes an energy-saving hierarchical clustering based on overlapping field-of-views (FoVs) of nodes in WMSN in presence of arbitrarily located obstacles within the network area. Performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated through simulation primarily to analyze the effect of obstacle in network area over clustering. Finally the efficacy of the scheme is measured in terms of network lifetime where results clearly show the present scheme's supremacy compared to one FoV based clustering with no hierarchy and the other with no clustering at all. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Open source hardware is increasingly becoming popular within the makers community, and many organizations are finding ways to leverage the new phenomenon. Open source processes are fundamentally different because they are driven by evolutionary processes, as compared to traditional hierarchical design processes. Hence, a critical driving factor for their success is the ability to use and to make improvements and modifications over existing designs. Making modifications in simple products, where the changes in one aspect of the product do not propagate to other aspects, is relatively easier than in complex products. Currently, such modifications are difficult to perform on complex hardware products, thereby limiting the evolution of open source hardware products. In this chapter, we discuss some of these technological and knowledge barriers faced by the open hardware community in modifying and validating open hardware products. The discussion is guided by an illustrative example of an open source 3D printer. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014. All rights reserved.},

In recent years, the widespread use of building materials mixed with slag make the average indoor radon level increased. The protection and mitigation on construction work are the key and low-cost method to reduce indoor radon. The average height of collection chamber is 0.5m required by the procedure of active drawing air type for measuring radon exhalation rates from building materials surface defined by GB50325-2010. In this paper, we find that higher height of the collection chamber can reduce the 220Rn interference in 222Rn measurements by numerical simulation; and also can decrease the 222Rn concentration in the collection chamber to reduce the effect of back-diffusion. 222Rn exhalation rate can be obtained by low-cost equipment and simple calculations.},

abstract={In the last years close-range photogrammetric scanning systems, are acquiring a larger market share. This is due to low-cost hardware, components and to new user-friendly software. The ultimate, photogrammetric 3D scanning systems are very accurate and precise because, of the high-resolution cameras (over 10 Mpixels) they are equipped of and, the more precise algorithms of their software. The calibration phase is the primary step for the development of a, precise photogrammetric scanner. Through a good calibration it is indeed, possible to eliminate optical aberration issues and to obtain precise and, accurate three-dimensional measurements. In this study a powerful, calibration method, named full-field calibration, was implemented to, obtain high-precision values, using an original three-dimensional, calibrator, developed so as to increase the performance of this type of, calibration. Prior to using any measurement or 3D scanning system, precision and, accuracy have to be assessed. In this study a robust validation method, for photogrammetric scanning systems has been proposed. The validation, procedure consisted in: (1) operator error analysis, (2) reproducibility, error-analysis, (3) control-system error analysis, (4) scanning system, error analysis., The measurements taken using the "control system" (certified equipment in, terms of precision and accuracy) were considered as "gold standard". The, photogrammetric measurements, subsequently obtained by the scanning, system, were aligned to the "gold standard" using Procrustes, registration. The system error was expressed as the displacement between, these two sets of measurements. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

New algorithm in this paper combines Bresenham algorithm with the symmetry nature of lines, advantages of Bresenham algorithm are kept and rasterization speed is improved in this way.

abstract={Vision-based SLAM is mostly a solved problem providing clear, sharp images can be obtained. However, in outdoor environments a number of factors such as rough terrain, high speeds and hardware limitations can result in these conditions not being met. High speed transit on rough terrain can lead to image blur and under/over exposure, problems that cannot easily be dealt with using low cost hardware. Furthermore, recently there has been a growth in interest in lifelong autonomy for robots, which brings with it the challenge in outdoor environments of dealing with a moving sun and lack of constant artificial lighting. In this paper, we present a lightweight approach to visual localization and visual odometry that addresses the challenges posed by perceptual change and low cost cameras. The approach combines low resolution imagery with the SLAM algorithm, RatSLAM. We test the system using a cheap consumer camera mounted on a small vehicle in a mixed urban and vegetated environment, at times ranging from dawn to dusk and in conditions ranging from sunny weather to rain. We first show that the system is able to provide reliable mapping and recall over the course of the day and incrementally incorporate new visual scenes from different times into an existing map. We then restrict the system to only learning visual scenes at one time of day, and show that the system is still able to localize and map at other times of day. The results demonstrate the viability of the approach in situations where image quality is poor and environmental or hardware factors preclude the use of visual features. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.},

abstract={The ever-intensifying time-to-market pressure imposes great challenges on the pre-silicon design phase of hardware. Before the tape-out, a pre-silicon design has to be thoroughly inspected by time-consuming functional verification and code review to exclude bugs. For functional verification and code review, a critical issue determining their efficiency is the allocation of resources (e.g., computational resources and manpower) to different modules of a design, which is conventionally guided by designers' experiences. Such practices, though simple and straightforward, may take high risks of wasting resources on bug-free modules or missing bugs in buggy modules, and thus could affect the success and timeline of the tape-out. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called pre-silicon bug forecast to predict the bug information of hardware designs. In this framework, bug models are built via machine learning techniques to characterize the relationship between design characteristics and the bug information, which can be leveraged to predict how bugs distribute in different modules of the current design. Such predicted bug information is adequate to regulate the resources among different modules to achieve efficient functional verification and code review. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed pre-silicon bug forecast framework, we conducted detailed experiments on several open-source hardware projects. Moreover, we also investigate the impacts of different learning techniques and different sets of characteristic on the performance of bug models. Experimental results show that with appropriate learning techniques and characteristics, about 90% modules could be correctly predicted as buggy or clean and the number of bugs of each module could also be accurately predicted. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents the implementation of the coarse-grained reconfigurable architecture (CGRA) DART with on-line error detection intended for increasing fault-tolerance. Most parts of the data paths and of the local memory of DART are protected using residue code modulo 3, whereas only the logic unit is protected using duplication with comparison. These low-cost hardware techniques would allow to tolerate temporary faults (including so called soft errors caused by radiation), provided that some technique based on re-execution of the last operation is used. Synthesis results obtained for a 90 nm CMOS technology have confirmed significant hardware and power consumption savings of the proposed approach over commonly used duplication with comparison. Introducing one extra pipeline stage in the self-checking version of the basic arithmetic blocks has allowed to significantly reduce the delay overhead compared to our previous design. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The capability to fabricate photovoltaic (PV) solar cells on a large scale and at a competitive price is a milestone waiting to be achieved. Currently, such a fabrication method is lacking because the effective methods are either difficult to scale up or expensive due to the necessity for fabrication in a vacuum environment. Nevertheless, for a class of thin film solar cells, in which the solar cell materials can be processed in a solution, up scalable and vacuum-free fabrication techniques can be envisioned. In this context, all or some layers of polymer, dye-sensitized, quantum dot, and copper indium gallium selenide thin film solar cells illustrate some examples that may be processed in solution. The solution-processed materials may be transferred to the substrate by atomizing the solution and carrying the spray droplets to the substrate, a process that will form a thin film after evaporation of the solvent. Spray coating is performed at atmospheric pressure using low cost equipment with a roll-to-roll process capability, making it an attractive fabrication technique, provided that fairly uniform layers with high charge carrier separation and transport capability can be made. In this paper, the feasibility, the recent advances and challenges of fabricating spray-on thin film solar cells, the dynamics of spray and droplet impaction on the substrate, the photo-induced electron transfer in spray-on solar cells, the challenges on characterization and simulation, and the commercialization status of spray-on solar cells are discussed. © 2014 by the authors.},

abstract={Direct-conversion radio receivers can offer highly integrated low-cost hardware solutions for cognitive radio (CR) devices. Such receivers are, however, also very sensitive to various radio frequency (RF) impairments such as IQ imbalance, which can considerably limit the spectrum sensing capabilities. Most of the existing spectrum sensing studies in literature assume an ideal RF receiver and hence neglect the impacts of such practical RF hardware limitations. In this article, we study energy detection (ED) based spectrum sensing in both single-channel and multi-channel direct-conversion receiver scenarios impaired by IQ imbalance. With complex Gaussian primary user (PU) signal models, we first derive the detection and false alarm probabilities in closed-form for both receiver scenarios. The analytical results, confirmed through extensive simulations, show that while the single-channel receiver scenario is fairly robust to IQ imbalance, the wideband multi-channel sensing receiver is very sensitive to the image channel crosstalk induced by IQ imbalance. More specifically, it is shown that the false alarm probability of multi-channel energy detection increases significantly, compared to ideal RF receiver case, and the exact performance depends on the image channel power level and IQ imbalance values. In order to prevent such degradation in the ability to identify free spectrum, a waveform level interference cancellation method is then proposed to mitigate the image channel crosstalk. The optimum cancellation coefficient yielding interference-free signal is first derived, being also complemented with a practical coefficient sample estimator. An explicit condition is also derived for which the proposed cancellation scheme deploying the practical coefficient sample estimator provides performance gain in the sensing decisions compared to uncompensated energy detection. Extensive computer simulations with various signal and imbalance conditions are provided which demonstrate that the proposed enhanced energy detection can suppress the image channel crosstalk efficiently, yielding detection and false alarm probabilities essentially identical to those of an ideal RF receiver. © 1983-2012 IEEE.},

The design implementation of the proof of concept employs open-source hardware architecture using Arduino and off-the-shelf sensors which lends itself to mass production, low cost and easy maintenance. This system is intended to service rural and low income urban consumers who will not be able to afford existing sophisticated and expensive home automation systems. A device identification module (DIM) that recognizes the devices in use at every room is implemented. The energy usage is continuously monitored and the user is notified of his consumption over a twenty four hour period. As many of the intended users are possible first time energy consumers, the energy monitoring system will inculcate a sense of energy consciousness and ensure grass root level sustainability. The energy consumption data is logged in the system and can be used by the utility service provider (USP) for future system planning, optimization and demand side management. The proof of concept developed and tested under laboratory conditions costs under USD 11 and will reduce further on commercialization. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Simple data, such as temperature, humidity and luminary, gathered by nodes in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), can hardly meet the growing needs for real-time information. The availability of low-cost hardware is enabling the development of wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs), i.e., networks of resource-constrained wireless devices that can retrieve multimedia content such as video and audio streams, still images, and scalar sensor data from the environment. However, multi-function means complex design, effective hardware, robust protocol and many other considerations. Comparing some of those current mainstream WMSN test beds, limits and shortcomings can be easily found. In this paper, MR. Eye is designed. Nodes, within MR. Eye, built on OMAP3530, are capable of coping with video, images and other real-time information. Moreover, the load balanced airtime with energy awareness (LBA-EA) is applied in this system and nodes can be easily controlled by SNMP gateway. The last but not the least, realtime video data can be transmitted fluently in multi-hop scenarios. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014.},

abstract={To achieve a target bit-rate reduction of 50% over H.264/AVC while maintaining equivalent perceptual video quality, High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) includes several new coding tools including a new set of integer transforms. Since these transforms are more complex than the H.264/AVC transforms, it is more challenging to design and develop high-performance integer transform hardware for HEVC. In this paper, we propose a series of high-throughput and low-cost hardware-oriented HEVC transform algorithms by using a butterfly structure and replacing multiplications by additions and shift operations in a way that minimizes critical computation paths. Compared to the algorithms using other methodologies like multiplierless multiple constant multiplication (MMCM) or decomposition to sparse matrices, our algorithms achieve around 20% shorter critical paths while consuming relatively small numbers of additions and shift operations. Hardware designs applying our proposed algorithms can increase their throughput by 20% while maintaining a reasonable resource consumption compared to when applying other algorithms. © 2014 IEEE.},

Their successful re-entry into society remains a challenge due to difficulty finding gainful employment. We report on an initiative to assist youth at the Children and Youth Empowerment Centre in Nyeri to start their own businesses. A thriving suburban dairy sector in Kenya has led to strong demand for hay. Hay can be produced in the rural areas, baled, and transported to the towns. We introduced low-cost equipment to produce hay bales: Scythes to mow grass, and a push-through manual hay baler to make dense bales. Youth were trained in operating and maintaining scythes and construction of the manual hay baler. They formed a 4-person hay-baling team that made more than 500 bales for local farmers, being paid by the bale, enabling them to generate up to US$5 pp per day. Existence of an active hay market, skills training, a supporting organization, mentors, and project continuity over many years were identified as the key factors leading to success.},

abstract={Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are at the core of the future industrial control systems. Most industrial CPSs are usually implemented over expensive and domain-specific hardware platforms, such as industrial embedded control systems, mainly for safety and security reasons. In less-critical applications the use of open, low-cost hardware platforms that provide adequate computing capabilities, such as microcontroller test boards, may provide an interesting alternative to reduce costs and reduce prototyping time. However, for most automation engineers working with this kind of platforms may become a daunting task because of the new concepts to be learnt. So, in the authors' view, it could be very valuable easing the application of current industrial standards on top of such low-cost platforms. In particular, the IEC 61499 standard provides a higher level of design, which allows combining software components in a flexible way, with independence of the underlying hardware. This work addresses the design of applications by means of the IEC 61499 standard on top of Raspberry Pi boards. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Machine-to-Machine technology supports several application scenarios, such as smart metering, automotive, healthcare and city monitoring. Smart metering applications have attracted the interest of companies and governments since these applications bring many benefits (e.g. costs reduction and increased reliability) for production, monitoring and distribution of utilities, such as gas, water and electricity. Multi-hop wireless communication is a cost-effective technology for smart metering applications because it extends the wireless range and enables fast deployment. Smart metering data communicated via wireless multi-hop approaches needs mechanisms that makes the communication less vulnerable to security threats and saves the device resources. Data encryption and data aggregation mechanisms emerge as potential solutions to fulfill these requirements. However, the simultaneous execution of data encryption and data aggregation mechanisms is not a trivial task. This is because the data encryption prevents the data aggregation mechanism to summarize the data along the path. Another challenge is to manage both mechanisms according to the concurrent Machine-to-Machine (M2M) applications interests. In this context, we present sMeter, which is a framework that deals with multiple applications interests, avoiding interest conflicts of concurrent users and supporting the management of data aggregation and data encryption. sMeter is implemented using low-cost hardware in an indoor environment. The communication is performed via a wireless multi-hop technology, and the performance of this communication is evaluated in terms of delay, data reception ratio and received signal strength indication. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Environmental data are critical to understanding environmental phenomena. This paper describes the design and development of a low-cost environmental monitoring system including sensor, data logger, and transmitter using several low-cost, open-source, mass-produced components. The system is connected to the open source Hydrologic Information System (HIS) software created by the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Sciences Inc. (CUAHSI) through a web service interface to the HIS HydroServer Lite. It is expected that this connection will enable the ingestion into the CUAHI HIS of near-real-time data collected by our low-cost device or similar devices through HydroServer. By publishing data in this way, it becomes discoverable through the GIS-based CUAHSI tools, HydroDesktop and HydroShare. Additionally, because it follows WaterML encoding, open hardware data stored in the HIS can be included in international catalogues such as the Global Earth Observation System of System (GEOSS) catalogue.},

abstract={Practices related to open source hardware and software, open design and digital fabrication demonstrate new ways for designing and producing things. In the domain of open source technology, novel paradigms emerge in which customization is combined with personal fabrication, product development is expanded by users' co-design, open licenses replace the traditional patents system. We assume that the impact of those paradigms activate opportunities for developing new design approaches that consider products as platforms: similarly to open source prototyping platforms such as Arduino, "products- platforms" feature several interactive layers that enable people to access, reconfigure and build upon the physical parts, behaviors and interfaces of the product. The workshop aims to engage participants in an experimental process addressed to the conception of interactive "products-platforms" that are open source artifacts that users can modify or build upon thanks to an ecosystem of shared documentation, services and licenses. In particular, the participants will focus on the definition of solutions for facilitating the configuration, customization and re-production of the interactive product, by discussing the limits and the opportunities of the current open source ecosystem (technology, interfaces, communities, etc.). The workshop reflects on the integration of the human centered design approach into the open source culture and it proposes a framework for designing innovative open source products.},

abstract={Rapid prototyping is a key aspect for the development of innovative robotic applications. A modular, platform-based, approach is the way to obtain this result. Modular approaches are common for software development, but hardware is still crafted often re-inventing solutions every time. As a consequence, the resources that should be invested in the development of a new robot get often drained by the implementation of a physical, working prototype to test the application idea. To overcome this problem, we propose R2P (Rapid Robot Prototyping), a framework to implement real-time, high-quality architectures for robotic systems with off-the-shelf basic modules (e.g., sensors, actuators, and controllers), integrating hardware and software, which can be assembled in a plug-and-play way. R2P provides hardware modules, a protocol for real-time communication, a middleware to connect components as well as tools to support the development of software on the modules. R2P aims at dramatically reduce time and efforts required to build a prototype robot, making it possible to focus the resources on the development of new robotic applications instead of struggling on their implementation. This enables also people with experience in a specific application domain, but with little technical background, to actively participate in the development of new robotic applications. R2P is open-source both in its software and hardware to promote its diffusion among the robotics community and novel business models that will substantially reduce the costs to design a new robotic product. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We describe the littleBits system, explain how littleBits 'programs' are constructed as configurations of physical modules in the real world, and describe how they are typically used to control physical artefacts or constructions. We then argue that littleBits constructions essentially 'visualise themselves'. We describe how littleBits' liveness, embodiment, and plasticity assists both learning and debugging, and then evaluate littleBits configurations according to the cognitive dimensions of notations. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The important prerequisites of designing pattern classifier are high throughput and low cost hardware implementation. The simple, regular, modular and cascadable local neighborhood sparse network of Cellular Automata (CA) suits ideally for low cost VLSI implementation. Thus the multiple attractor CA is adapted for use as a pattern classifier. By concatenating two predecessor multiple attractor CA (TPMACA) we can construct a pattern classifier. In this paper we propose a method for finding dependency vector by using a 0-basic path. Also we propose various methods for generating TPMACA corresponding to a given dependency vector. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

abstract={Color science is perhaps the most universally tangible discipline within the optical sciences for people of all ages. Excepting a small and relatively well-understood minority, we can see that the world around us consists of a multitude of colors; yet, describing the "what", "why", and "how" of these colors is not an easy task, especially without some sort of equally colorful visual aids. While static displays (e.g., poster boards, etc.) serve their purpose, there is a growing trend, aided by the recent permeation of small interactive devices into our society, for interactive and immersive learning. However, for the uninitiated, designing software and hardware for this purpose may not be within the purview of all optical scientists and engineers. Enter open source. Open source "anything" are those tools and designs-hardware or software-that are available and free to use, often without any restrictive licensing. Open source software may be familiar to some, but the open source hardware movement is relatively new. These are electronic circuit board designs that are provided for free and can be implemented in physical hardware by anyone. This movement has led to the availability of some relatively inexpensive, but quite capable, computing power for the creation of small devices. This paper will showcase the design and implementation of the software and hardware that was used to create an interactive demonstration kit for color. Its purpose is to introduce and demonstrate the concepts of color spectra, additive color, color rendering, and metamers. © 2014 SPIE.},

abstract={This paper presents the state-of-the-art for building a low cost mobile robot with open-source technology based on sensor fusion. Designing open-source educational robots has a great impact on empowering engineers and those interested in mobile robots. In the last decade, different robots have been designed and built for this purpose. In this project, with the help of sensors available on a 9-axis open-source IMU and a robot based on open-source hardware and control software, a graphical user interface has been implemented to view the condition of motion variables in a real-time manner and combine sensor data. Moreover, by implementing different filter programs, such as low-pass filter, complementary filter and by using KF implementation and deliberation this mobile robot becomes suitable for improving the accuracy of the robot in extracting parameters required for localization, mapping and robot navigation. Features of the developed robot, the so-called TL-OSR, can be regarded as: using open-source hardware and software with real-time performance, low price equipment, presenting a solution based on sensor fusion for better accuracy in robot navigation and using different types of sensors. This robot can be used as an suitable open-source platform as a new class of mobile robots for educational and research purposes in mechatronics and robotics. © 2014 IEEE.},

A vertebrate's behaviors like focusing attention, cautious risk-aversion and curiosity-seeking exploration are influenced by these neuromodulators. The paper presents an autonomous robotic control approach based on vertebrate neuromodulation and its implementation on multiple open-source hardware platforms. A simple neural network is used to model the neuromodulatory functions for generating context based behavioral responses to sensory signals. The neural network incorporates three types of neurons-attention focusing cholinergic and noradrenergic (ACh/NE), curiosity-seeking dopaminergic (DA), and risk aversive serotonergic (5-HT) neurons. The implementation of the neuronal model on multiple relatively simple autonomous robots is illustrated through the interesting behavior of the robots adapting to changes in the environment. The implementation is done in open-source, open-access robotics software framework of Robot Operating System (ROS). Copyright © 2014 by ASME.},

abstract={This paper presents concepts for implementing a variable step scheduled code on a low cost hardware using automatically generated code from Simulink running on a Free RTOS powered hardware. For models, which use a varying computing step, implementing variable step scheduler, instead of the default automatically generated fixed step scheduler, can improve algorithm performance. Concept and principles for creating Simulink model for code generation, which behaves the same way as generated code does, are explained in details. Previously described approach for automatically generated code from Simulink which implements variable step simulation is demonstrated using simple algorithm, running on a Cerebot MX7cK hardware. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

Therefore we launched the Robotic Open Platform (ROP). A place to share and discuss open hardware designs. Among others it currently contains detailed descriptions of Willow Garage's TurtleBot, the NimbRo-OP created by the University of Bonn and the AMIGO robot of Tech United Eindhoven. Eventually, ROP will contain a collection of affordable hardware components, allowing researchers to focus on cutting-edge research on a particular component instead of having to design the entire robot from scratch. As an example of how the Robotic Open Platform is able to facilitate this knowledge transfer, we introduce TURTLE-5k: A redesign of an existing soccer robot by a consortium of our university and companies in the wider Eindhoven area.

abstract={The multistandard video and image codec using a single platform is the recent trend in multimedia technologies, in which the Two-Dimensional forward and inverse Discrete Cosine Transform (2-D DCT/IDCT) is used as a transform core. Therefore, the 2-D DCT/IDCT core should support multiple transforms and that to be implemented with low cost hardware, while keeping the required performances for real time applications. In this study, a fast multistandard DCT/IDCT generalized algorithms are developed with low comple×ity for 2×2, 4×4 and 8×8 forward/inverse transforms in H.264/Advanced Video Coding (AVC), 8×8 forward/inverse transform in Audio Video Coding Standard (AVS), 4×4 and 8×8 forward/inverse transforms in VC-1 and 8×8 forward/inverse discrete cosine transform in JPEG and MPEG-1/2/4. The hardware implementation of these generalized algorithms is performed with low cost hardware, in which the hardware sharing design and shared factorization of coefficient multiplications are used. Furthermore the multiplications are avoided by using additions and shifts. The multistandard 2-D DCT/IDCT is achieved with the proposed 1-D DCT/IDCT sharing architecture and a robust transpose buffer. These pipelined hardware architectures are described in VHDL hardware language, synthesized, verified and implemented on low cost FPGA. The implementation results of the proposed multistandard 2-D DCT/IDCT show a decrease of computational comple×ity by 29.7% of additions while the number of shifts remains almost the same and an increase of ma×imum frequency and throughput by 18.2% in comparison with other previous design. © 2014 Academic Journals Inc.},

abstract={The hyper-spectrum data exhibits the structure, materials, and semantic meaning of a nature scene and its fast acquisition is of great importance due to its potential for parse these properties of dynamic scenes. Targeting for high speed hyperspectrum imaging of a nature scene, this paper proposes to capture the coded hyper-spectrum reflectance of a nature scene using low cost hardware and reconstruct the latent data using a corresponding decoding algorithm. Except for a wide spectrum light source, the imaging system includes mainly a commercially available projector color wheel and a high speed camera, which work at their own constant periods and are self-synchronized by our algorithm. The introduced light source and color wheel cost less than 50 dollars and makes the proposed approach widely available. The results on the data captured by our prototype system show that, the proposed approach can reconstruct the high precision hyper-spectrum data at real time. © 2014 SPIE.},

The microgrid control and coordination infrastructure has been realized as a hierarchical multi-agent system (MAS) comprising of the DG agents, the Mu agent and the D agent. The Communication (Mu) Agent acts as a link between the lower-level microgrid agents (distributed energy resources (DERs), the load, the storage and the utility grid) which provide the required digital parameter inputs, and the Control Agent comprising of the Cloud. Data storage, analytics and control commands are generated based on the rule engine updates given by the Utility Service Provider (USP) to the Cloud. The microgrid side input data are converted into appropriate GPRS signals within the Arduino. The specific functions that enable this conversion are elucidated as pseudocode. Further, the cloud control commands are sent back to the various microgrid-side agents via the Mu agent as GPRS signals. The communication strategy has been explained in detail and has been implemented using Arduino keeping in mind system costs, ease of operability and maintenance. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents a low-cost open source prototype of a gesture recognition and interpretation glove that aids audio-vocally impaired individuals in communication. A sensor based glove for recognition of the gestures in the American Sign Language (ASL) is the input module to the system. It incorporates resistive flex sensors and contact sensors appropriately positioned to obtain a theoretical efficiency of 96% in character recognition. When the sensors are subjected to change in orientation by the user, the variation in electrical resistance of each of the individual sensors is obtained as the input to an Arduino ATMega328 microcontroller that accurately maps it to the letters of the English alphabet through an efficient algorithm. An elegant methodology that is easy to implement using a microcontroller is employed for the mapping process to minimize the complexity of the system. The paper also presents a detailed study of the efficiency characteristics involved in the construction of the custom-designed flex sensors utilized in the system. The paper outlines the calibration and testing results of the sensors.The highlights of the system are its ergonomic and economical design, portability and intelligent gesture recognition and interpretation ability. The implemented system achieves a practical efficiency of up to 80% of theoretical efficiency. The cost of the system is approximately less than USD 5 at laboratory condition using off the shelf components. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={In this modern world many communication devices are highly intelligent and interconnected between each other. Any up-gradation of the hardware in the existing communication devices is not easier one. Compatibility of the new hardware with existing hardware is highly essential. But the new protocols may or may not support the older one. The solution for these problems can be provided by using the reconfigurable hardware design. The hardware can be reprogrammed according to the new change in technology up-gradation. The cost of commercially available hardware and software requirements for setting up such a module is very high. This can be solved by using Open source hardware and software such as Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) and GNU Radio. This work demonstrates how the modern analog communication system like Community Radio Schemes and Radio Data System (RDS) and digital communication systems such as Simple Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) and OFDM based data communication can be developed using the Open source hardware USRP1.

abstract={Ring-rolling is an industrial forming process to produce high-strength metal rings up to 6m diameter. Thick-walled cylindrical workpieces of material, typically metallic alloys, are compressed between two or more internal and external rollers and rotated until a target geometry, often outer diameter, is achieved. The process is inherently unstable and the process is often constrained and/or controlled to improve its stability. This paper presents an image processing algorithm for the measurement of ring geometry through photogrammetry in real-time. These measurements will form part of the feedback control system for a ring-rolling process. An off-the-shelf USB webcam is used to capture images of the ring during forming and the scene is controlled to maximise contrast and minimise occlusions of the ring. The image processing tasks include object identification, edge detection, outlier rejection and distortion rectification. The process has been implemented on a desktop-scale forming machine and has been shown to work at rates suitable for control the ring-rolling process using feedback. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The diagnosis of electrical motors through the detection of fault frequency signatures in the current's spectrum has become an established standard in the field of industrial maintenance systems. Nevertheles, its implementation on devices with low computing power remains a practical challenge. Industrial controllers, such as programmable logic controllers, or modern, low cost controller hardware, such as the Arduino or the Raspberry Pi open source hardware proposals, lack both the on-board memory and the high speed data acquisition hardware to perform an accurate spectral analysis of the machine's current, in order to identify the spectral components produced by each type of fault. In this paper, a signal conditioning unit, based on a novel downsampling method of the current, is presented. This unit reduces the amount of current samples that must be processed by the diagnostic unit to a mere sample per current cycle, maintains the sub-hertz accuracy needed to resolve fault, and converts the mains component into a constant value that can be easily eliminated without using any additional filter. Besides, it is implemented using low cost devices, just resistors and operational amplifiers. The proposed method is theoretically developed in this paper, and it has been validated using induction motors with broken bars fed directly by the mains or through variable speed drives. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Durability means the resistance to physical or chemical deterioration of concrete resulting from interaction with environment (physical deterioration) or interaction between constituents (chemical deterioration) of concrete. A durable concrete ensures corrosion resistance of embedded steel which in turn ensures a better longevity of the structure as a whole. Concrete in structures in the coastal areas are the most susceptible to chemical deterioration as sea water, with high concentration of chloride ions, has quite a detrimental effect on durability of concrete. In these cases, the lower the chloride permeability, the better the durability of concrete. As instruments for standard chloride permeability test is very expensive, an experiment has been conducted to carry out Rapid Chloride Permeability Test (RCPT) using improvised apparatus made of readily available low-cost materials.

abstract={Surface profile control on heliostats is crucial because the mirror surface can be imperfectly manufactured, and the distribution of solar irradiance on the receiver is sensitive to the slope of the heliostat surface. In practice heliostat surface irregularities introduce aberrations that contribute to enlarge the spot on the receiver and the resulting energetic losses depend on the collection characteristics of the solar plant. Since the solar field can be formed by thousands of mirrors, it is indispensable to have a method of rapid and economic control to be used during the operations of fabrication and successively also on the field during installation. The proposed method is based on techniques of structured light and assesses the heliostat surface quality by means of the inspection of a colored pattern image. This on-site optical control was applied on various mirror types, adapting the colored pattern. The method application requires only a photographic camera and a screen with heliostat sizes. Mirror surface defects appear as deformations in the pattern image. The main advantages are facility of application, low-cost equipment, elaboration simplicity. © 2014 WIT Press.},

abstract={Purpose: The democratization of invention is a long lasting desire for the advancement of society. Having access to education and the means of production appears as the major factors for the implementation of this goal. 3D printing is a revolutionary technology that has the potential to bring digital manufacturing to everyone. However, the rise of personal fabrication requires an increase in printing quality, a reduction on machine cost and an increase in knowledge shared by the open hardware community. The purpose of this paper is to explore the development of a new Open Hardware printer project to address these points. Design/methodology/approach: The authors have designed and constructed a low-cost photopolymer-based 3D printer called BeamMaker. The printer is connected to a host computer and a digital-light-processing projector. This work details the design process and how improvements were implemented to reach good printing quality. The authors provide public access to the instructions, software, source code, parts list, user manual and STL and CAD files. Findings: The BeamMaker printer can build objects with a high surface quality that is comparable to the quality obtained by industrial photopolymer-based 3D printers. When testing the ability to print a sample cylinder, the printer shows higher accuracy when compared to other personal 3D printers. These findings are encouraging considering the low cost of the system. Research limitations/implications: The printing failure rate of the system has not been measured to date. The system requires some improvements to produce large objects. Practical implications: The printer cost is just USD380. This is five to eight times less expensive than popular personal 3D printers available today. The cost is 30 times less expensive than a personal photopolymer 3D printer produced by a main commercial company and yet producing results of similar quality. The authors expect good avenues for collaboration from the open-source community to continue improving these systems. Social implications: The high cost of current personal 3D printers prevents users from developing countries from entering into the open hardware trend. A dramatic reduction in printer cost such as that explored in this work might contribute to the real democratization of personal fabrication. Originality/value: The authors report on the status of three other photopolymer-based personal 3D printer projects. To the best of the authors' knowledge, BeamMaker is the first fully open hardware 3D printer project which uses this technology. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This work presents acompact and low cost equipment for water desalination using electrodialysis (ED) with the aim to increase the lifetime of industrial machines that are installed near or above the sea and use seawater for cooling or operation purposes. The water desalinator equipment is mainly composed of four set of grills which are energized by applying a direct current (DC) to them. Two sets of them are positive charged and the other two sets are negative charged. The grills are charged in an alternative manner, it means that one set is negative charged followed by another set which is positive charged. The negative charged grills attract the positive charged ions which are calcium & sodium, and the positive charged grills attract the negative charged ions which are chloride & sulfate. The seawater was pretreated before and after the desalination process using an activated carbon filter to extract most of the suspended solids in the water. In addition different flow rates and voltages were applied to the experiment to observe the relationship between them and to find the parameters and variables that increase the efficiency of the desalination equipment. © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={A Biomedical Signal Processing (BSP) laboratory course has a cost associated with its implementation and maintenance. This cost can sometimes be a barrier to be overcome by institutions intending to launch their own comprehensive laboratories for the processing and analysis of biomedical signals (biosignals). As a result, when it comes to BSP, many courses are designed to provide the students with a dry and theoretical application of mathematical methods only, forgetting to focus on hands-on projects to boost the students' learning curve. This work in progress describes the design process of a comprehensive BSP laboratory course using low-cost hardware and software. We describe the methods utilized to generate the documentation needed for the course, and also a detailed list of the materials used and their main features. We divided the design process in two main categories: 1) analog circuit design; and 2) digital signal processing and software development. We provide details about these two categories and subdivide the structure of the course into seven laboratory experiments to be completed individually or by a group of students. After the completion of this project, a collection of seven laboratory guides will be fully designed and this hands-on BSP course will be ready to be disseminated and implemented. In addition, all the materials and documentation created throughout this project are periodically uploaded into the group's Smart System online webpage (http://smartsystems.eng.fau.edu/biomedical-signal- processing/) for easy and free access. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2014.},

Despite the increasing role of Safety Inspection (SI), due to the qualitative nature of the approach, management issues remain in the use of SI as source of information to prioritize those measures and sections with the highest benefit-cost ratio. Based on these considerations and starting from the results of IASP EU research project, a Safety Risk Index (SRI) has been formulated as measure of risk that uses Safety Inspection as primary source of information. To improve the quality and efficiency of the periodic inspections of road network, a system of software tools based on low cost equipment have been developed. Firstly, a tool was developed for an android tablet to allow infield inspections. After the inspection phase another tool is used in the office to make a review of the inspection and to carry out the SRI. Finally a tool was implemented in order to prioritize the intervention works that produce the greatest safety benefits. © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={We discuss the evolution and state-of-the-art of the use of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) in the field of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (PaRS). UAS, Remotely-Piloted Aerial Systems, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles or simply, drones are a hot topic comprising a diverse array of aspects including technology, privacy rights, safety and regulations, and even war and peace. Modern photogrammetry and remote sensing identified the potential of UAS-sourced imagery more than thirty years ago. In the last five years, these two sister disciplines have developed technology and methods that challenge the current aeronautical regulatory framework and their own traditional acquisition and processing methods. Navety and ingenuity have combined off-the-shelf, low-cost equipment with sophisticated computer vision, robotics and geomatic engineering. The results are cm-level resolution and accuracy products that can be generated even with cameras costing a few-hundred euros. In this review article, following a brief historic background and regulatory status analysis, we review the recent unmanned aircraft, sensing, navigation, orientation and general data processing developments for UAS photogrammetry and remote sensing with emphasis on the nano-micro-mini UAS segment. © 2014 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

abstract={Grasping and manipulation in unstructured environments must handle a wide range of object properties and significant sensing errors. Underactuation and compliance have been shown to be an effective way to improve grasping performance under such uncertainty, but the degree of compliance plays an important role in both gently adapting to sensing errors and maintaining stable grasps of heavy objects. These demands limit the range of objects that can be grasped. We consider the role and required characteristics of tactile sensing as a compensation method when compliance alone is insufficient. By strategic use of contact sensing, it is possible to expand the capabilities of a hand to grasp effectively under a wide range of positioning errors using simple position-driven motors and low-cost hardware. © 2014 IEEE.},

A case study is presented where the platform is developed to provide both the colorimetry for biochemical oxygen demand/chemical oxygen demand and nephelometry to measure turbidity using method ISO 7027. This approach resulted in equipment that is as accurate, but costs between 7.5 and 15 times less than current commercially available tools.

abstract={Traditionally, the complexities and costs associated with design conceptualization (e.g., 3D scanning) and design realization (e.g., 3D printing) have limited the diversity of individuals capable of participating in the process to individuals/entities with advanced technical backgrounds or substantial financial resources. The authors of this work propose a methodology that utilizes low cost hardware and open source software to make the capture, reuse and management of design knowledge more accessible to the general public. 3D scanners are digital tools that facilitate the conversion of physical object information into the digital space through multiple image capture techniques. 3D scanners have the potential to revolutionize design conceptualization in society by enabling individuals to seamlessly transform physical representations of objects into a digital 3D rendered version. The 3D rendered version can then be manipulated using existing 3D CAD tools (e.g., SolidWorks) and subsequently printed using a 3D printer. Design realization via 3D printers (e.g., RepRaps) is becoming an integral aspect of the engineering design process. While the conceptualization of designs (e.g. CAD models) helps designers visually experience potential candidate designs, product prototypes that can actually be touched and manipulated add an important 'feedback' dimension to the engineering design process. This scan-edit-print approach to design conceptualization and realization will enable designers collaborating in online environments to work towards achieving a common design by providing them with tools and techniques. A case study is presented that demonstrates the feasibility of the scan (knowledge capture), edit (knowledge reuse) and print (knowledge management) approach to design using low cost hardware and open source software.

abstract={Over time, environmental protection standards have become more strict and complex. Nitrogen oxides (NOx) are regulated pollutants produced by combustion in a diesel engine. In this project, camshaft timing modifications were studied as a way of reducing NOx emission levels while using low cost hardware. Different valve timing strategies were proposed and modelled using engine simulation. This project was based on two concepts. The first was to open the intake valve during the exhaust stroke, thus expelling burnt gases from the cylinder into the intake manifold and then later re-admitting these gases into the cylinder during the intake stroke of the next cycle. The second was to open the exhaust valve during the intake stroke, allowing burnt gases from the exhaust manifold to enter the cylinder at the same time as the fresh charge enters. Both technologies studied were able to recirculate the exhaust gases without an external EGR system. The EGR amount was controlled by either an intake throttle or an exhaust throttle. The amount of EGR was predicted using engine simulation. The brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and brake-specific NOx (BSNOx) trade off was the main criterion used to select the best technology, although other features such as predicted manifold pressures and engine-out soot were also considered. The results indicate that, by using increased amounts of EGR while varying the intake or exhaust throttle position, NOx emissions can be reduced with a slight BSFC penalty. These methods are thus a low cost means of reducing engine-out NOx emissions. © 2014 by ASME.},

abstract={The rapid advancement of low cost embedded systems invites engineering educators to deliver content and skills while engaging students in hands-on projects that may potentially make use of a variety of platforms. From proprietary to open source hardware and software, from microcontrollers to embedded operating systems (OS) devices, students today are challenged to accelerate their learning pace by working on real-world projects in a supervised environment. Currently, students rely on self-guidance in order to develop the knowledge base necessary for achieving the goals of their team projects with respect to embedded systems. This paper presents the results of an embedded systems programming tutorial piloted with a group of 15 undergraduate students from across the engineering disciplines and with a mix of sophomores through seniors. The tutorial included a series of three lecture modules prepared to introduce concepts on embedded systems. The modules were tightly coupled with hands-on exercises that employed the DE2i-150 development board, aimed to introduce students to the development of digital systems based on an Altera field programmable gate array (FPGA) in conjunction with an Linux-based embedded OS running on an Intel Atom processor. The first module provides an overview of the various inputs, outputs, sensors, and displays of the board. The second module introduces the embedded OS and guides students in establishing a high-speed Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) link between the Atom processor and the FPGA. The third module focuses on implementing a custom C/++ application written by students for real- Time processing of inputs from four push buttons. Results show that the three lecture modules of 30 minutes each, coupled with the hands-on projects, offer a good introduction to the complexity of the DE2i-150 board. Surveys collected before the first module and after the third show a generally positive outcome. Recommendations for future efforts focus on incorporating more complex C/++ applications concurrent with FPGA development. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2014.},

abstract={Pulmonary rehabilitation is an essential component of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) management with strong evidence supporting the efficacy of pulmonary rehabilitation to improve exercise capacity and quality of life, as well as reduce hospital admissions. However, it is estimated that only 2-5% of people with COPD who could benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation have access to programs. Most research on the benefits of pulmonary rehabilitation has used equipment such as cycle ergometers and treadmills for endurance training and weight machines for resistance training. To enable greater availability of pulmonary rehabilitation, the efficacy of exercise training using minimal equipment needs to be evaluated. Randomised controlled trials that used minimal, low cost equipment for endurance (eight trials) and strength training (three trials) compared to no training in people with COPD were evaluated. Statistically and clinically significant differences in functional exercise capacity and quality of life, as well as improvements in strength were demonstrated when exercise training with minimal equipment was compared to no training [six-minute walk test: mean difference 40 (95% CI: 13 to 67) metres; St George's Respiratory Questionnaire: mean difference -7 (95% CI: -12 to -3) points]. While the number of studies is relatively small and of variable quality, there is growing evidence that exercise training using minimal, low cost equipment may be an alternative to equipment-intensive pulmonary rehabilitation programs. © 2011-2014 Journals of thoracic Disease.},

abstract={The environmental monitoring system apparently appears to be an easy tool, but it hides some drawbacks such as high purchase and maintenance costs. This implies that the use of technologies to monitor cultural heritage is somewhat limited to analyze sites where the degradation conditions are of particular relevance. With this in mind, the aim of such a research activity is to compare two monitoring systems in relation with the decay problems affecting the paintings of the crypt of St. Francesco d’Assisi in Irsina (Basilicata, Southern Italy). The first system is a low-cost Arduino wireless platform based on opensource hardware and user friendly software. The second monitoring equipment is a standard commercial product. The basic idea of such a comparison is to attempt to reduce greatly the costs as well as significantly increase the applicability of long-term monitoring systems on a large scale. © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, London.},

abstract={The German Federal Office for Radiation Protection operates a network of about 1800 gamma dose rate stations as a part of the national emergency preparedness plan. Each of the six network centres is capable of operating the network alone. Most of the used hardware and software have been developed in-house under open-source license. Short development cycles and close cooperation between developers and users ensure robustness, transparency and fast maintenance procedures, thus avoiding unnecessary complex solutions. This also reduces the overall costs of the network operation. An easy-to-expand web interface has been developed to make the complete system available to other interested network operators in order to increase cooperation between different countries. The interface is also regularly in use for education during scholarships of trainees supported, e.g. by the 'International Atomic Energy Agency' to operate a local area dose rate monitoring test network. © The Author 2014.

abstract={The Internet of Things makes use of a huge disparity of technologies at very different levels that help one to the other to accomplish goals that were previously regarded as unthinkable in terms of ubiquity or scalability. If the Internet of Things is expected to interconnect every day devices or appliances and enable communications between them, a broad range of new services, applications and products can be foreseen. For example, monitoring is a process where sensors have widespread use for measuring environmental parameters (temperature, light, chemical agents, etc.) but obtaining readings at the exact physical point they want to be obtained from, or about the exact wanted parameter can be a clumsy, time-consuming task that is not easily adaptable to new requirements. In order to tackle this challenge, a proposal on a system used to monitor any conceivable environment, which additionally is able to monitor the status of its own components and heal some of the most usual issues of a Wireless Sensor Network, is presented here in detail, covering all the layers that give it shape in terms of devices, communications or services.},

The course includes topics in software design patterns, multi-threaded applications, rudimentary user-interface design, embedded programming including sensor building and processing, and Zigbee-based wireless communications. The course is 2 semester credits (1-2-3), and includes a comprehensive project that requires students to build a tangible game or a game-like entertainment system. One key component of the course is the use of an open-source hardware platform called Arduino. The results are that students enjoy the course and are able to build integrated systems that incorporate design patterns, multithreading, embedded programming and wireless communication in an effective manner within one semester. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Serial Windows-based programs are widely used in power utilities. For applications that require high-volume simulations, the sequential runtime can be in the order of days or weeks. The lengthy runtime, along with the availability of low-cost hardware, is leading utilities to seriously consider high performance computing (HPC) techniques. However, the majority of the HPC computers are Linux-based, and many HPC applications have been custom developed without considering existing simulation tools and ease of use. This has created a technical gap for applying HPC-based tools to today's power grid studies using Windows-based tools. To fill this gap and accelerate the acceptance and adoption of HPC for power grid applications, this paper presents a prototype of a generic HPC platform for running Windows-based power grid tools on the Linux-based HPC environment. The preliminary results show that the runtime can be significantly reduced from weeks to hours to improve work efficiency. © IFAC.},

abstract={Cooperative sensor self-localization (CSL) in wireless networks usually requires the nodes to be equipped with specific ranging hardware including ultra-wideband or ultrasonic distance sensors. Such designs are not suitable for application in low-cost, low-power sensor networks. Here, we demonstrate how low-cost, low-power, asynchronous sensor nodes can be used to perform CSL (and, simultaneously, distributed synchronization) by means of time-stamped communication without additional ranging hardware. Our method combines a belief propagation message passing algorithm for cooperative simultaneous localization and synchronization (CoSLAS) with a MAC-layer time stamping scheme.We validate the models underlying the CoSLAS algorithm by means of measurements, and we demonstrate that the localization accuracy achieved by our hardware implementation is far better than that corresponding to the time resolution and measurement errors of the hardware. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={One serious challenge of wireless multi-hop ad hoc networks is frequent link and node failures due to lossy wireless channels and low-cost hardware. Failure detection plays an important role in network maintenance. In order to reduce communication overhead, local-based failure detection methods conduct diagnosis processes in a local area. However, the overhead of them is still very large because several redundant detection processes are triggered for one failure by several nodes. In this paper, we present a new failure detection approach named Root Node Reduction (RNR), which can reduce the number of detection processes by a backoff scheme. Furthermore, we propose two additional strategies to improve diagnosis accuracy, including multi fusion which guarantees complete evidence collection, and multi report which improves the reception ratio of diagnosis conclusion report. The comparison results show that the performance of communication overhead, diagnosis accuracy and data packet reception is improved by these schemes. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Frequency modulation continuous wave (FMCW) fuze has the advantages of low probability of intercept and high ranging accuracy. The traditional harmonic detection algorithm used for FMCW fuze has the inherent error, which is inversely proportional to the frequency offset. And the computing amount of FFT method used for the short range frequency modulated radar is huge, and the hardware is not easy to implement in low cost application. A new algorithm based on the derivative ratio is proposed to reduce the error without increasing the frequency offset. Furthermore, owing to the severe requirement related to the volume and cost of traditional fuze, the new method has the advantage of small amount of computation and high real-time performance, which makes it more implementable in low-cost hardware such as the single chip microcomputer (SCM).},

It is shown that minimal low-cost hardware modifications to existing compact ground planes of the 915-MHz radar allow for reduction of sidelobes of up to 5 dB. The results obtained on a single array are extended to a 449-MHz triple hexagonal array interferometric radar. Cross-correlation, transmit beamwidth, and sidelobe levels are evaluated for various clutter fence configurations and array spacings. The resulting sidelobes are as much as 10 dB below those without a clutter fence and can be easily incorporated into existing and future 915 and 449-MHz wind profiler systems with minimal hardware modifications. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The pedagogical literature has consistently and repeatedly shown that active learning is more effective than passive learning in teaching students fundamental engineering concepts, yet the lecture persists as the primary method of classroom organization for the vast majority of professors. Even among those professors who have read the literature and are willing to change their teaching methods, a barrier to adoption of active learning strategies is the time and effort required to develop the classroom activities for a particular course. This paper describes a series of experiments that can be done in class with low-cost equipment in an introductory circuits course. In each class period, a brief lecture at the beginning of the course went over the relative circuit theory, such as Ohm's Law and Kirchoff's laws. Then the instructor worked out a numerical example for a given circuit. Finally the students are instructed to build a circuit corresponding the example problem and make the necessary measurements to verify the theory. The class was divided into teams of four students each, and each team was given an equipment pack during the first week of class. The equipment packs included a budget digital multimeter (DMM), a number of resistors, a capacitor, LED, hobby-size DC motor, 9V battery, and lead wires with alligator clips for connecting the components. Students were instructed to bring the equipment packs to class every day, and they were also given homework assignments that required the use of the equipment packs. Though some breakage will occur and batteries may be accidentally discharged, the equipment packs can be re-used from year to year. Once the initial investment has been made, further upgrades with additional components can also be done in subsequent years. This paper contains a complete list of experiments that can easily be implemented by other instructors, and is also suitable for use in "flipped" classrooms. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2013.},

abstract={The Internet of Things, otherwise known as IoT, IPv6 or Industr y 4.0 is going to become wider, linking 25 billion smart devices and intelligent systems in operation around the world. Ethernet-based networks, such as EtherCAT, allow every part of an automation system, from sensors to robots, to exchange information at high speeds. This gives the controller instant access to every detail of production information. Once this controller is also connected to the enterprise-level Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP) or Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES). End-user IT departments will have to work more closely with engineering to allow shop-floor equipment to have direct access to enterprise-level systems without the use of middleware. The latest controllers, such as Omron's Sysmac NJ series, combine the reliability and rugged design of a traditional PLC, but use an open hardware architecture combined with software ?engines' within a single CPU, rather than multiple CPUs, to manage their different functions. Ricoh plans to use similar instant communication with an enterprise-level database to scan codes on used toner cartridges sent to its Telford site for recycling. In this case, an NJ controller will allow data, including the number of previous refills, to be checked. This will in turn enable the system to determine whether any given cartridge should be refilled again, while also updating the database. The FAG SmartCheck from Schaeffler FAG recognises and reports the first vibrations of a system long before any noise is generated. That means there is substantially longer time to react before the machine fails.},

abstract={The data centre at the Galician Institute of High Energy Physics (IGFAE) of the Santiago de Compostela University (USC) is a computing cluster with about 150 nodes and 1250 cores that hosts the LHCb Tiers 2 and 3. In this small data centre, and of course in similar or bigger ones, it is very important to keep optimal conditions of temperature, humidity and pressure. Therefore, it is a necessity to monitor the environment and be able to trigger alarms when operating outside the recommended settings. There are currently many tools and systems developed for data centre monitoring, but until recent years all of them were of commercial nature and expensive. In recent years there has been an increasing interest in the use of technologies based on Arduino due to its open hardware licensing and the low cost of this type of components. In this article we describe the system developed to monitor IGFAE's data centre, which integrates an Arduino controlled sensor network with the Nagios monitoring software. Sensors of several types, temperature, humidity and pressure, are connected to the Arduino board. The Nagios software is in charge of monitoring the various sensors and, with the help of Nagiosgraph, to keep track of the historic data and to produce the plots. An Arduino program, developed in house, provides the Nagios plugin with the readout of one or several sensors depending on the plugin's request. The Nagios plugin for reading the temperature sensors also broadcasts an SNMP trap when the temperature gets out of the allowed operating range. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={A key issue in VoIP services market is the availability of tools that permit a constant monitoring of the relevant Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. Several commercial and open-source solutions are available, based on dedicated hardware and/or open-source software. These solutions aim to achieve a tradeoff between performance and instrumentation cost. In general, high performance and precise monitoring tools are based on dedicated hardware, which is expensive. In contrast, cheaper software-based solutions working on top of a Commercially available Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware are performance-limited, especially when serving high-capacity links. In this context, the paper presents an open-source solution for QoS monitoring of VoIP traffic that achieves high performance at significantly lower costs. The proposed solution exploits the performance capabilities achievable with a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The associated costs reduction arises from the high flexibility of an FPGA. Our experimental analysis explores the accuracy of the developed prototype, measuring against relevant QoS parameters of VoIP traffic on high capacity links. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

abstract={The objective of this paper is to describe a Product Lifecycle Management process for IEEE's Humanitarian Technology (HT) 'Solutions' that leverages IEEE's peer-review. In 2011, the Humanitarian Initiatives Committee (HIC) of IEEE Region 7 organized a student design competition [1] with the specific objective of understanding the design process of HT 'Solutions' to be made available as open source. The 2011 competition was an initial effort to understand open source licensing, open source hardware and the open source development model. Adoption of the open source development model was a stated objective of IEEE's Humanitarian technology Challenge (HTC) [2]. The HIC held a student paper competition in 2013. The goal of the 2013 competition was to nurture the growing interest in Humanitarian Technology in Region 7; to address HIC's concerns from the 2011 competition, more effort was focused in the paper review process for the 2013 competition and standard IEEE peer-review tools and processes were used. This document presents in Section III the lessons learned during these two competitions, and proposes in section IV a Product Lifecycle Management framework for the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) of OSI development that leverages IEEE's peer-review process. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The application of rehabilitation programs based on videogames with brain-computer interfaces (BCI) allows to provide feedback to the user with the expectation of stimulate the brain plasticity that will restore the motor control. The use of specific mental strategies such as Motor Imagery (MI) in neuroscientific experiments with BCI systems often requires the acquisition of sophisticated interfaces and specialized software for execution, which usually have a high implementation costs. We present a combination of low-cost hardware and open-source software for the implementation of videogame based on virtual reality with MI and its potential use as neurotherapy for stroke patients. Three machine learning algorithms for the BCI signals classification are shown: LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) and two Support Vector Machines (SVM) in order to determine which task of MI is being performed by the user in a particular moment of the experiment. All classification algorithms was evaluated in 8 healthy subjects, the average accuracy of the best classifier was 96.7%, which shows that it is possible to carry out serious neuroscientific experiments with MI using low-cost BCI systems and achieve comparable accuracies with more sophisticated and expensive devices.},

abstract={This paper introduces a new data-driven bottom-up monitoring approach for distribution systems. Unlike model-based techniques, which require a given number of measurement inputs for their state estimation equations, this approach uses an artificial neural network to directly estimate the voltages. Thus, the process does not use state estimation equations and is flexible with regard to the number of required measurements. Depending on the available measurements, the estimation accuracy may vary but there are no convergence issues. Furthermore, rather than performing voltage estimations for the entire system in a single step, this approach uses a hierarchical, bottom-up structure to build up the overall picture. More precisely, the estimations performed at the MV/LV substations are communicated to the upper-level HV/MV substation, contributing to more accurate voltage estimation at MV level. The estimation process is computationally simple and can be executed on low-cost hardware, as demonstrated in this work. In our test, BeagleBone Black was used for implementing the developed algorithm. Preliminary results are presented which show representative estimations in an LV feeder. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={A continuous-time plant with a discretized continuous-time controller does not yield stability if the sampling rate is lower than some certain level. Thus far, high-performance electronic control has made use of expensive hardware needed to implement discretized continuous-time controllers; low-cost hardware generally does not have a sufficiently high sampling rate. This technical note presents results comparing performance indexes with and without intersample behavior, and provides some answers to the question of how a low-specification device can control a plant effectively. We consider a machine simulating wafer handling robots, which is an electromechanical system driven by a direct drive motor, at a semiconductor factory. We illustrate the controller design for the robot with and without intersample behavior, and present simulations and experimental results using these controllers. Taking intersample behavior into account proves to be effective in improving control performance and makes it possible to choose a relatively long sampling period. Controller design in terms of the performance index with intersample behavior makes it possible to deal with situations in which a sufficiently short sampling period may not be employed, and freedom of controller design may be widened, especially regarding the choice of the sampling period. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

In fact, the properties of real world powerline channels are substantially different from those commonly exhibited by their wireless counterparts, so that standard methods for wireless channel sounding cannot be adapted to a powerline scenario. In this paper, after providing some general design guidelines for powerline channel sounding, a detailed description of a FPGA-based implementation of a wideband powerline channel sounder is provided. Such a tool is based on low cost hardware and is flexible, since it can be easily customized to user needs using a set of simple graphical user interfaces. Some of its specific applications, namely the estimation of the time-varying transfer function of an indoor powerline channel and the evaluation of the power spectral density of the noise affecting it, are illustrated to show the potentialities of the developed equipment. © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={We can conclude that passive bistatic radar has come a long way since the first experiments in the early 1980s - and certainly since the first radar experiments using broadcast signals more than 50 years before that. Potentially, it offers covert operation with simple and low-cost equipment without the need for a transmitting license, and the ability to use parts of the elecromagnetic spectrum not normally available for radar use. The wide variety of broadcast, communications, and radionavigation sources and their excellent spatial coverage gives great scope for PBR. In common with all bistatic radars, it may allow mechanisms such as forward scatter, which enhances the radar signature of targets, to be exploited. The fact that PBR systems can be simple and low cost has meant that they have been very suitable for research by university groups, and there have been numerous publications on the subject. © 2014 by SciTech Publishing, Edison, NJ.

Most wind projects base their financial projections on a 20-year model, and wind turbines are designed to meet or exceed that expectation based on the wind loads as defined by IEC6140-1. In achieving the expected 20-year life, most effort is focused on the major components, including main shafts, gearboxes, the generator and the electronics that support its operation, rotor leads, bearings, stator windings, collector rings, and magnetic wedges. The maintenance issues that need to be addressed while developing a wind project maintenance plan are really the same as for any other large generating site or industrial facility. Although there are many ways to structure the risk, there is general agreement on how reliability allows you to maximize profitability for the project when the wind is blowing.},

abstract={The intermediate frequency electromagnetic oscillation technique was used to obtain the ideal semi-solid metal slurry and billet of the aluminum alloy ZL104. In this research, the proper number of oscillation was mainly discussed when using the intermediate frequency electromagnetic oscillation technique to produce semi-solid slurry. The influence of the electromagnetic fields generated by electromagnetic stirrer on the microstructure of the semi-solid slurry and billet was also analyzed. The results indicate that the method is easy to operate with short process and low-cost equipment. The semi-solid materials obtained from this method are uniform and do not show a skin-effect caused by the electromagnetic field distribution unevenness. Minimum average equivalent diameter of primary α-Al is 28 μm, and the shape factor of primary α-Al is 0.89.},

abstract={Because of superficial location and not being covered by boney structure, thyroid is the ideal organ for 2-dimensional gray scale ultrasonography. Availability of relatively low cost equipment and ever increasing number of endocrinolo-gists with expertise in thyroid ultrasound has made it an integral part of thyroid practice in the office of endocrinolo-gists. In particular, the current recommendation for fine needle biopsy of thyroid nodules is ultrasound guided biopsy. Follow up of thyroid nodules for change in size can also be better documented by ultrasound than palpation. Alt-hough cytology obtained by fine needle biopsy is the gold standard for detection of malignancy, yet ultrasound fea-tures of the nodules direct the clinician to select for biopsy the higher risk nodules in a multinodular gland. For detec-tion of parathyroid adenoma isotopic parathyroid scan is preferable but ultrasound is occasionally is needed for con-firmation, in particular for cases when parathyroid isotopic scan is ambiguous. The present article is an overview of ultrasonography of thyroid and parathyroid intended for endocrinologists.},

Most researchers tend to select the values of their parameters in long and tedious trial and error approaches. Although, some methods have been developed for automatic parameter selection, they have not been widely used in the computer vision area. This paper presents the design of a general purpose framework for automatic parameter selection through a case study: a human limb tracking algorithm developed for applications that will be used in rehabilitation scenarios with low cost equipment. The tracking algorithm first detects the limb by using a skin segmentation approach, then the position of an idealized limb model is updated using Simulated Annealing. The framework for automatic parameter selection treats each parameter from the tracking algorithm according to its domain and uses a modified version of Harmony Search Optimization algorithm that includes a dominance criterion. The obtained results are presented as well and show that selected parameters behave well for the case of study.},

abstract={Today, the environmental monitoring and quality have a growing interest. This promotes the development of new monitoring tools, and especially those with outstanding reliability and response time, and nonstationary features. This paper presents the design and implementation of a transportable gas detection and environmental monitoring device. Ideas taken from the Arduino and Lego constructions are kept in mind during the design of the device, looking further facilitate the development of product family of this device; likewise, the use of reconfigurable and interconnectable platforms with open hardware are considered. The transducers have been selected based on their reliability, small size and easy inclusion in an electronic system. Then, was developed a device that supports transducers for environmental gases, such as: carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), volatile organic compounds (VOC), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2); as well as the possibility to interface with other systems for common gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxygen (O2) before developed. Other environmental measures such as speed and wind direction, temperature and relative humidity, may also be included. In this case, a configurable platform based on mixed-signal circuits, PSoC5, was used for the development of embedded system. This platform can be interfaced with different Arduino shields and achieves the integration of several analog functions. This system manages, acquires and processes signals from the above transducers. The measurements can be displayed on an LCD display, save into an SD memory and send to the Web using Ethernet interface. The device is hand size, easy to carry and can operate with a battery. Its user interface is simple and provides updated and in-situ readings. Currently, successful results have been obtained from the functional and metrology testing of the manufactured prototype. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={This work explores the combination of gaze and speech to interact with objects in the environment. A head-mounted wireless gaze tracker in the form of gaze tracking glasses is used for mobile monitoring of a subject's point of regard on the surrounding environment. In our proposed system, a mobile subject gazes at an object of interest in the environment which opens an interaction window with the object being gazed upon, and a specific interaction command is then given to the object using speech commands. The gaze tracking glasses were made from low-cost hardware consisting of a safety glasses' frame and wireless eye tracking and scene cameras. An open source gaze estimation algorithm is used for eye tracking and user's gaze estimation. The Windows Speech Recognition engine is used for recognition of voice commands. A visual markers recognition library is used to identify objects in the environment through the scene camera. When combining all these elements, the emerging system permits a subject to move freely in an environment, select the object he wants to interact with using gaze (identification) and transmit a control command to it by uttering a speech command (control).

abstract={The future of air traffic control (ATC) will heavily depend on the Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) protocol as a crucial component. ADS-B marks a paradigm change in airspace monitoring as global ATC is switching from an independent, radar-based approach to dependent, satellite-supported surveillance. With ADS-B, aircraft broadcast their own position and other information in short periodic messages to other aircraft and control stations on the ground. As the protocol is becoming mandatory in most airspaces over the next years, it is important that its characteristics and challenges are thoroughly investigated. The large-scale ADS-B data required to do this has not been openly accessible until now, as specialized and expensive infrastructure was needed. We demonstrate OpenSky, a sensor network based on low-cost hardware connected over the Internet, which enables real-world experimental studies. OpenSky works with off-the-shelf sensors run by volunteers distributed over Central Europe. Currently comprising 11 sensors, the sensor network covers an area of 720,000 km2. We capture more than 30% of Europe's commercial air traffic, offering access to billions of ADS-B messages. © 2014 IEEE.},

While such emerging technologies provide benefits like storage density, nonvolatility, and low energy consumption, they are constrained by limited write endurance that becomes more pronounced with process variation. In this article, we explore a novel PRAM-based main memory system which resuscitates a group of faulty pages in a cost-effective manner to significantly extend the PCM main memory lifetime while minimizing the performance impact. In particular, we explore three different dimensions of dynamic redundancy levels and group sizes, and design low-cost hardware and software support for our proposed schemes. We aim to have minimal hardware modifications (that have less than 1% on-chip and off-chip area overheads). Also, our schemes can improve the PRAM lifetime by up to 105× (times) over a chip with no error correction capabilities, and outperform prior schemes such as DRM and ECP at a small fraction of the hardware cost. The performance overhead resulting from our scheme is less than 8% on average across 21 applications from SPEC2006, Splash-2, and PARSEC benchmark suites.},

abstract={Radio Interferometric ranging (RIR) is a breakthrough in the area of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) node localization technique because it achieves high accuracy ranging result with simple, low-cost hardware. Although some experiences from a few prototypes and a recent result about the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) of RIR sheds some light on its performance, our limited understanding of RIR performance in medium to low signal to noise ratio (SNR) range remains a major obstacle in its widespread adoption. This paper tries to explore the performance of maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of RIR in medium to low SNR region. We derive the formula between the mean square error (MSE) of the MLE with respect to the measurement SNR and a few system design parameters employing the method of interval errors (MIE) in the statistical signal processing technique. Extensive simulations and experiments show that the obtained MSE formula is good enough to predict the MSE performance of MLE in the whole SNR region, including the medium to low SNR region, which sweeps out the important obstacle for the widespread adoption of RIR.},

Thus we have a paradox: the more communist the sharing license used in the peer production of free software or open hardware, the more capitalist the practice. To tackle this paradox and the aforementioned contradictions, we tentatively suggest a new convergence that would combine both Commons-oriented open peer production models with common ownership and governance models, such as those of the co-operatives and the solidarity economic models.},

abstract={Time synchronization plays an important role in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Due to the unique features of WSNs such as remote deployment, low-cost hardware, and restrictive energy supply, accurate and robust time synchronization is still a challenging task. Many approaches have been proposed to improve the performance and efficiency of time synchronization. Existing schemes, however, do not pay enough attention to the impacts of varying network topology properties, including network diameter, degree distribution, and the like. They can experience unexpected performance degradation in many real systems. To address these issues, we present a novel approach, which tries to improve the performance of existing time synchronization algorithms by introducing a virtual overlay. We propose an integrated model, called topo-refiner, which encodes the impact of different network topology features to the precision and robustness of time synchronization. Also, we design a novel optimization algorithm to build a virtual overlay from the underlying communication network. Our approach is orthogonal to existing clock synchronization methods, and can improve their performance by operating these methods atop the virtual layer. Finally, in order to verify the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive simulations on synthetic and real system traces, as well as testbed experiments. Results show that topo-refiner is practical, and quickly adapts to varying time synchronization accuracy requirements for applications in WSNs. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) is one of the key components of the next generation air transportation system. Since ADS-B will become mandatory by 2020 for most airspaces, it is important that aspects such as capacity, applications, and security are investigated by an independent research community. However, large-scale real-world data was previously only accessible to a few closed industrial and governmental groups because it required specialized and expensive equipment. To enable researchers to conduct experimental studies based on real data, we developed OpenSky, a sensor network based on low-cost hardware connected over the Internet. OpenSky is based on off-the-shelf ADS-B sensors distributed to volunteers throughout Central Europe. It covers 720,000 km2, is able to capture more than 30% of the commercial air traffic in Europe, and enables researchers to analyze billions of ADS-B messages. In this paper, we report on the challenges we faced during the development and deployment of this participatory network and the insights we gained over the last two years of operations as a service to academic research groups. We go on to provide real-world insights about the possibilities and limitations of such low-cost sensor networks concerning air traffic surveillance and further applications such as multilateration. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Clouds play an important role in climate change, in the prediction of local weather and also on aviation safety when instrument assisted flying is not available. In the case of aviation safety, the most important parameters are the cloud base height and the amount of cloud cover. Cloud base height can be measured by a ceilometer which, due to its relatively high cost, is not available at many small aerodromes. Recently, a low cost solution, based in digital photography and stereovision has been proposed. This paper describes the developed prototype along with its measuring principle and the recent advances which include more robust but low cost hardware, an automated calibration procedure based on photos of stars that exhibit no parallax and an automated procedure to find the cameras orientation relative to geographic north. Measurements of the cloud base height by the proposed system are compared with measurements obtained by a LIDAR for validation. The wind speed and direction relative to geographic north are also measured and compared with results from a weather model. Finally, an uncertainty analysis of the measurement system is presented. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This architecture is a hardware and software co-design where embedded processors drive the FPGA for motor control. It is robot type independent, as long as the motors are equipped with incremental position encoders and driven by PWM signals. Low cost, low power consumption, high stability, flexibility and expandability are the key advantages. The architecture and related IP cores are developed through a component-based design model which interprets a mechatronic system by computation, communication, configuration and coordination components, together with composition of these components and blackboxes. The motor controller IP core is provided in the consistency of open hardware. Open software implies the use of OROCOS (Bruyninckx, 2001).

abstract={Testing voltage source inverters (VSI) by using a set of real machines is often unsatisfactory. In fact, besides not being economical, this method only allows cursory inspection since the behaviour of an inverter under test (IUT) can then almost be assessed under few typical working conditions. In order to overcome these drawbacks, the present paper describes a low-cost hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) emulator for electric drives based on commercial IGBT voltage source inverters (VSI), the Virtual Machine (VM). Making use of several parallel-connected standard VSIs of the same type as the IUT, the VM is able to reproduce not only the steady state but also the dynamics of a real induction motor in a realistic way. This essential aspect is achieved by switching the IGBTs inside the inverters of the VM sequentially. Since the proposed HiL emulator is fully parameterizable, almost every induction machine within the power range of the IUT can be emulated. With the VM, extensive tests of power electronics devices can be carried out inexpensively and in short time intervals, a very convenient feature, especially for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). © 2014, Taylor and Francis Ltd.

abstract={In this article, we describe a system for machine vision-based lumber strength prediction. The system utilizes images taken from all four sides of pinewood boards. Those images are further divided into small subareas, and the local gradients inside each area are used to calculate the local grain direction. Together, these directions form the grain direction map. The grain direction map and knot features are used to predict the breaking strength of the board. Because of the high speed of production lines, we also present a parallel general-purpose graphics processing unit (GPGPU) implementation of the method to achieve real-time performance using low-cost hardware. We describe the challenges of the design on a GPU compared with a traditional central processing unit implementation. Most of the modern sawmills already have multiple camera systems in use, making the camera-based strength prediction extremely cost effective. In our experiments, an r2 value of 0.63 was obtained between the measured strength attributes of the board and our strength prediction coefficient. The ground truth for the breaking strength was measured using destructive 3-point bending tests. Using a regular desktop computer, the described system achieves a throughput of over 50 Mpixels/s. For the parallel implementation, we provide qualitative evaluation of the results and a comparison of the computational speed on several platforms. © Forest Products Society 2014.},

abstract={The study of biosignals has had a transforming role in multiple aspects of our society, which go well beyond the health sciences domains to which they were traditionally associated with. While biomedical engineering is a classical discipline where the topic is amply covered, today biosignals are a matter of interest for students, researchers and hobbyists in areas including computer science, informatics, electrical engineering, among others. Regardless of the context, the use of biosignals in experimental activities and practical projects is heavily bounded by the cost, and limited access to adequate support materials. In this paper we present an accessible, albeit versatile toolkit, composed of low-cost hardware and software, which was created to reinforce the engagement of different people in the field of biosignals. The hardware consists of a modular wireless biosignal acquisition system that can be used to support classroom activities, interface with other devices, or perform rapid prototyping of end-user applications. The software comprehends a set of programming APIs, a biosignal processing toolbox, and a framework for real time data acquisition and postprocessing. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract={In the machining program for free form surfaces, the tool path is usually represented as continuous short lines. For the computer numerical control, the feedrate profile for short line tool path should be smooth and optimized in order to achieve high machining quality and high speed. In high speed machining, the feedrate profile also has a strong influence on contour accuracy. This paper presents a new real-time smooth feedrate planning algorithm for short line tool path, in which the contour error constraint is included. To realize contour error control, the feedrate is adaptively adjusted based on the curvature radius of the tool path, which is directly estimated from the short lines. The 7-phase jerk-limited look-ahead planning is employed to generate a smooth feedrate profile. The target feedrate filter (TFF) and planning units merging techniques are developed to improve the smoothness of the feedrate profile and reduce the overhead on look-ahead. The advantage of the proposed algorithm is that it is not only convenient to achieve the balance among accuracy, smoothness and productivity by adjusting parameters, but also efficient in design, which makes it possible to be implemented on low cost hardware platforms. Experiment results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm on smooth feedrate planning and contour error control for continuous short line tool path. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={A sensitive, simple and low-cost determination method for the total iron concentration in boiler water systems of power generation plants was developed by solid phase spectrometry (SPS) using 2,4,6-tris(2-pyridyl)-1,3,5-triazine (TPTZ) as a coloring agent. The reagents and 0.08 cm 3 of a cation exchanger were added to a 50-cm 3 boiler water sample, then mixed for 30 min to adsorb/concentrate the produced Fe(TPTZ) 2 2+ colored complex on the solid beads, resulting in a 625 times concentration of the target analyte without any other procedure. The detection limit of 0.1 μg dm -3 was obtained, and the optimum conditions for the digestion procedure and color developing reaction was investigated and reported. According to the application of this method to real samples, the present SPS method is the best one because of the shorter analysis time, simpler operation and use of very low-cost equipment compared to the conventional methods, such as TPTZ solution spectrophotometric method after a 16 times concentration, ICP-MS and AAS. © The Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry.},

abstract={The fungus species Wolfiporia extensa has a long history of medicinal usage and has also been commercially used to formulate nutraceuticals and functional foods in certain Asian countries. In the present study, a practical and promising method has been developed to discriminate the dried sclerotium of W. extensa collected from different geographical sites based on UV spectroscopy together with chemometrics methods. Characteristic fingerprint of low polar constituents of sample extracts that originated from chloroform has been obtained in the interval 250-400 nm. Chemometric pattern recognition methods such as partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were applied to enhance the authenticity of discrimination of the specimens. The results showed that W. extensa samples were well classified according to their geographical origins. The proposed method can fully utilize diversified fingerprint characteristics of sclerotium of W. extensa and requires low-cost equipment and short-time analysis in comparison with other techniques. Meanwhile, this simple and efficient method may serve as a basis for the authentication of other medicinal fungi. Copyright © 2014 Yan Li et al.},

abstract={As externally bonded fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) is a critical load-bearing component of strengthened or retrofitted civil infrastructures, the betterment of structural health monitoring (SHM) methodology for such composites is imperative. Henceforth the vibrational characteristics of near surface interfacial defects involving delamination and trapped air pockets at the FRP-concrete interface are investigated in this study using a finite element approach. Intuitively, due to its lower interfacial stiffness compared with an intact interface, a damaged region is expected to have a set of resonance frequencies different from an intact region when excited by acoustic waves. It has been observed that, when excited acoustically, both the vibrational amplitudes and frequency peaks in the response spectrum of the defects demonstrate a significant deviation from an intact FRP-bonded region. For a thin sheet of FRP bonded to concrete with sizable interfacial defects, the fundamental mode under free vibration is shown to be relatively low, in the order of kHz. Due to the low resonance frequencies of the defects, the use of low-cost equipment for interfacial defect detection via response spectrum analysis is highly feasible. © 2014 SPIE.},

abstract={The development of a mobile hops harvester is used as a case study to explore trends toward increased open source equipment development. Theory of intrinsic and extrinsic motivators of innovation are explored alongside current understanding of incentives for participation in open source design practices. Incentives for open source participation are varied and participants in a single product development project may come to the project for very different reasons. The concept of a "design-use community" is introduced as a way of articulating and emphasizing the blurred line between innovation and adoption in the agricultural technology community which the open source movement has highlighted. The authors provide observations of open source modalities in use through a case study of the mobile hops harvester which provides a specific example of when an open source design approach can be successful in developing new agricultural equipment. The harvester has a demonstrated capacity of 120 bines per hour compared to 1 bine per hour per person for manual picking. This rate enables the harvest of a 1 acre yard within 8 hours resulting in optimal harvest timing and improved quality. Assuming a harvest team of 4 people in either case, this translates to a harvest labor cost savings of 97% or $3,120 per acre at $15 per hour wage (approximately $2 per lb of dried hops (10-20% of retail price)).

abstract={This paper discusses a real-time diagnostics algorithm applied to detect mechanical failure in thin beams subjected to active structural control. A thin aluminum cantilever is equipped with piezoceramic actuators, and its position is measured at the free end by an optical device. The dynamics of the beam is approximated using a second order state-space model, which is augmented by the unknown mass, stiffness, viscous damping and force conversion constants. This model is utilized in the extended Kalman filter (EKF) to observe dynamic states and parameters. The estimated parameters are used to compute the first damped resonant frequency of the active structure, which is assumed to diverge from the nominal condition in case a mechanical failure occurs. This algorithm is implemented on a low-cost computing hardware using automatic code generation and deployment. In the experimental validation procedure, the piezoceramic transducers are supplied with a pseudorandom-binary signal, then the weight of the beam is changed to emulate variations in its mechanical properties. The role of the proposed method is to estimate the physical parameters of the beam and to detect sudden or gradual changes in configuration. The presented results demonstrate the real-time ability to diagnose changes in the mechanical configuration of the active cantilever beam, while also confirming the implementation feasibility of the proposed approach on miniaturized and mass-produced embedded microcontrollers.},

abstract={In this paper, the long-term learning properties of an artificial neural network model, designed for sound recognition and computational auditory scene analysis in general, are investigated. The model is designed to run for long periods of time (weeks to months) on low-cost hardware, used in a noise monitoring network, and builds upon previous work by the same authors. It consists of three neural layers, connected to each other by feedforward and feedback excitatory connections. It is shown that the different mechanisms that drive auditory attention emerge naturally from the way in which neural activation and intra-layer inhibitory connections are implemented in the model. Training of the artificial neural network is done following the Hebb principle, dictating that Cells that fire together, wire together, with some important modifications, compared to standard Hebbian learning. As the model is designed to be on-line for extended periods of time, also learning mechanisms need to be adapted to this. The learning needs to be strongly attention- and saliency-driven, in order not to waste available memory space for sounds that are of no interest to the human listener. The model also implements plasticity, in order to deal with new or changing input over time, without catastrophically forgetting what it already learned. On top of that, it is shown that also the implementation of short-term memory plays an important role in the long-term learning properties of the model. The above properties are investigated and demonstrated by training on real urban sound recordings. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={For robots operating in outdoor environments, a number of factors, including weather, time of day, rough terrain, high speeds, and hardware limitations, make performing vision-based simultaneous localization and mapping with current techniques infeasible due to factors such as image blur and/or underexposure, especially on smaller platforms and low-cost hardware. In this paper, we present novel visual place-recognition and odometry techniques that address the challenges posed by low lighting, perceptual change, and low-cost cameras. Our primary contribution is a novel two-step algorithm that combines fast low-resolution whole image matching with a higher-resolution patch-verification step, as well as image saliency methods that simultaneously improve performance and decrease computing time. The algorithms are demonstrated using consumer cameras mounted on a small vehicle in a mixed urban and vegetated environment and a car traversing highway and suburban streets, at different times of day and night and in various weather conditions. The algorithms achieve reliable mapping over the course of a day, both when incrementally incorporating new visual scenes from different times of day into an existing map, and when using a static map comprising visual scenes captured at only one point in time. Using the two-step place-recognition process, we demonstrate for the first time single-image, error-free place recognition at recall rates above 50% across a day-night dataset without prior training or utilization of image sequences. This place-recognition performance enables topologically correct mapping across day-night cycles. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={In the past 50 years, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) has gained widespread recognition as a life-saving skill that can be taught successfully to the general public. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation can be considered a cost-effective intervention that requires minimal classroom training and low-cost equipment and supplies; it is commonly taught throughout much of the developed world. But, the simplicity of CPR training and its access for the general public may be misleading, as outcomes for patients in cardiopulmonary arrest are poor and survival is dependent upon a comprehensive chain-of-survival, which is something not achieved easily in resource-limited health care settings. In addition to the significant financial and physical resources needed to both train and develop basic CPR capabilities within a community, there is a range of ethical questions that should also be considered. This report describes some of the financial and ethical challenges that might result from CPR training in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). It is determined that for many health care systems, CPR training may have financial and ethically-deleterious, unintended consequences. Evidence shows Basic Life Support (BLS) skills training in a community is an effective intervention to improve public health. But, health care systems with limited resources should include CPR training only after considering the full implications of that intervention.

abstract={Multi-ported RAMs are essential for high-performance parallel computation systems. VLIW and vector processors, CGRAs, DSPs, CMPs and other processing systems often rely upon multi-ported memories for parallel access, hence higher performance. Although memories with a large number of read and write ports are important, their high implementation cost means they are used sparingly in designs. As a result, FPGA vendors only provide dual-ported block RAMs to handle the majority of usage patterns. In this paper, a novel and modular approach is proposed to construct multi-ported memories out of basic dual-ported RAM blocks. Like other multi-ported RAM designs, each write port uses a different RAM bank and each read port uses bank replication. The main contribution of this work is an optimization that merges the previous live-value-table (LVT) and XOR approaches into a common design that uses a generalized, simpler structure we call an invalidation-based live-value-table (ILVT). Like a regular LVT, the I-LVT determines the correct bank to read from, but it differs in how updates to the table are made; the LVT approach requires multiple write ports, often leading to an areaintensive register-based implementation, while the XOR approach uses wider memories to accommodate the XOR-ed data and suffers from lower clock speeds. Two specific I-LVT implementations are proposed and evaluated, binary and one-hot coding. The I-LVT approach is especially suitable for larger multi-ported RAMs because the table is implemented only in SRAM cells. The I-LVT method gives higher performance while occupying less block RAMs than earlier approaches: for several configurations, the suggested method reduces the block RAM usage by over 44% and improves clock speed by over 76%. To assist others, we are releasing our fully parameterized Verilog implementation as an open source hardware library. The library has been extensively tested using ModelSim and Altera's Quartus tools.},

abstract={Urban sprawl is a major cause of environmental change, indirectly affecting climate processes on both the global and local scale and impacting the livelihoods of people who are directly dependent on ecosystem services. In the case of rapidly sprawling cities, land cover monitoring is a spatial planning requirement that must keep pace with urban growth, for the purpose of providing timely responses to environmental change and thus reducing people’s vulnerability. Due to the lack of financial resources, Least Developed Countries need affordable methodology for rapid and effective land cover monitoring, suitable for low cost equipment. This chapter presents a methodology for monitoring land cover changes in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, developed in the context of a project for the enhancement of local authorities’ capacity to assess vulnerability to climate change and mainstream adaptation objectives into urban development plans. This methodology relies on the classification of free Landsat images and is implementable using open-source software, with the specific purpose of making sustainable the continuous assessment of urban sprawl for Dar City Council’s planning services. The methodology phases are described, from preprocessing to processing. This includes the use of a free open-source plugin for QGIS, developed during the project, which allows for the semi-automatic classification of images. Classification results demonstrate the conspicuous urban growth of Dar es Salaam from 2002 to 2011, and provide insight into the relationship between urban sprawl and population growth. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

abstract={Diamond/Cu composites fabricated via the traditional powder metallurgy method show low thermal conductivities due to the poor wettability between diamond and Cu matrix. The fabrication method adopted in this study provides a simple and low-cost method for producing diamond/metal composites. Thermal properties of the diamond/Cu-Ti composites fabricated by pressureless sintering at 1373 K for 30 min with variation in diamond particle sizes and volume fractions were thoroughly investigated. The composites produced in this study exhibited thermal conductivity as high as 608 W/m K for 60 vol.% bimodal diamond/Cu-2 at.% Ti composite comprised of 50 vol.% diamond particles with the size of 300 μm and 10 vol.% diamond particles with the size of 150 μm. A suitable coefficient of thermal expansion of 5.4 × 10-6 1/K was obtained. This thermal conductivity value comes up to 92% of the thermal conductivity calculated by Hasselman and Johnson model combining with diffuse mismatch model. The predicted value from this model is in good agreement with the experimental value. Furthermore, the pressureless sintering is a simple technique that requires only low-cost equipment, making this cost-effective method attractive for metal matrix composite fabrication. © 2013 The Authors.

abstract={Plant phenotyping is an emerging science that links genomics with functional plant characteristics. The recent availability of extremely fast high-throughput genotyping technologies has invoked high-throughput phenotyping to become a major bottleneck in the plant breeding programs. As a consequence new camera-based technologies to relieve the phenotyping bottleneck attract considerable attention. Whereas most plant phenotyping technologies are based on the approach to bring the plants to the image recording device, our system brings the camera-system to the plants creating great flexibility on observing plants under practical growing conditions. A new camera, based on lightfield technology was used for image recording. This single lens 3D camera is constructed by placing a micro lens array in front of the image sensor. This also allows the user to change the focus and the point of view after a picture has been taken. While the concept of such plenoptic cameras is known since 1908, only recently the increased computing power of low-cost hardware and the advances in micro lens array production, have made the application of plenoptic cameras feasible. Since this camera outputs a pixel to pixel registered color image and depth map, it solves limitations of common used techniques such as stereo vision and time of flight. During the summer of 2013 an experiment is carried out in a commercial tomato greenhouse in the Netherlands. In this paper first preliminary results are presented and the performance of lightfield technology for plant phenotyping is discussed.

The dynamics of the WT are simulated on the open-source National Renewable Energy Laboratory WT simulator called FAST (Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structures, and Turbulence), which emulates all required input signals of the controller and reacts to the controller commands (almost) like an onshore real turbine of 5 MW. The dynamic torque control system runs on an open hardware Arduino microcontroller board, which is connected to the virtual WT via USB. In particular, the power generation control in the full load region for variable-speed variable-pitch wind turbines is considered through torque and pitch control. The HIL proposed platform is used to characterize the behavior of the WT in normal operation as well as in fault operation. In particular, a stuck/unstuck fault is modeled and the behavior of a proposed chattering torque controller is analyzed in comparison to a baseline torque controller. © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

This architecture would use open-hardware open-software gas sensing capable motes [6] made by Libelium. These motes use the ZigBee communication protocol and provide a real-time low cost monitoring system through the use of low cost, low data rate, and low power wireless communication technology. The proposed monitoring system can be transferred to or shared by other applications. We also introduce a simple but efficient clustering protocol dubbed hereafter "Clustering Protocol for Air Sensor network" (CPAS) for the proposed WSN-AQMS framework.

abstract={Background: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training at school is recommended. Limited school resources prevent implementation. The learning efficacy of low-cost training strategies is unknown. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of different CPR learning strategies using low-cost didactic tools. Methods: Children (n=593, 15-16 years) were randomized to four training conditions: (1) manikin+teacher instruction (control group), (2) manikin+video instruction, (3) foam dice+plastic bag+peer training+teacher instruction, and (4) foam dice+plastic bag+peer training+video instruction. After a 50 min training, a 3 min CPR test on a manikin was performed using SkillReporting Software (Laerdal, Norway), and repeated after 6 months. The data of children without previous CPR training were analysed. Analysis of variance and the χ-test assessed differences between groups. Results: Complete data sets were available for 165 pupils. Initially, group 3 scored lower on the mean ventilation volume (P<0.05). The control group scored better than the alternative groups (P<0.05) on the mean compression rate. After 6 months, the differences disappeared. All groups scored equally on ventilation volume (P=0.12), compression depth (P=0.11), compression rate (P=0.10), correct hand position (P=0.46) and number of correct compressions (P=0.76). Ventilation volume was sufficient in 32% of the pupils, 18% had a correct compression depth and 59% had a correct compression rate. Conclusion: Training efficacy with low-cost equipment was not different from training with a manikin. The outcome for all training strategies was suboptimal. The basics of CPR can be taught with alternative equipment if manikins are not available. © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

abstract={Understanding basic concepts of electronics and computer programming allows researchers to get the most out of the equipment found in their laboratories. Although a number of platforms have been specifically designed for the general public and are supported by a vast array of on-line tutorials, this subject is not normally included in university chemistry curricula. Aiming to provide the basic concepts of hardware and software, this article is focused on the design and use of a simple module to control a series of PDMS-based valves. The module is based on a low-cost microprocessor (Teensy) and open-source software (Arduino). The microvalves were fabricated using thin sheets of PDMS and patterned using CO2 laser engraving, providing a simple and efficient way to fabricate devices without the traditional photolithographic process or facilities. Synchronization of valve control enabled the development of two simple devices to perform injection (1.6 ± 0.4 μL/stroke) and mixing of different solutions. Furthermore, a practical demonstration of the utility of this system for microscale chemical sample handling and analysis was achieved performing an on-chip acid-base titration, followed by conductivity detection with an open-source low-cost detection system. Overall, the system provided a very reproducible (98%) platform to perform fluid delivery at the microfluidic scale. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

abstract={The goal of this work is to develop a low cost hardware-based demonstrator for system identification (SI) methods that can be used in a self-paced training kit by students as well as practicing engineers. The focus lies on hands-on training with a high return on effort. The training starts from experiments that are performed on the demonstrator, a real system that is introduced here. It can easily be used at home by the trainee without the need for external support or expensive equipment. The advantage for the SI community is that the steep learning curve, that often scares potential users of advanced SI methods, is flattened while the practical applicability of these methods is demonstrated altogether. The joint use of teaching material and hardware-based illustration provides enough knowledge, understanding and confidence to apply the methods on industrial scale systems. The first test case, which is presented here, is a mechanical setup. It consists of a nonlinear mass-spring-damper system built using commonly available components for a total cost of less than 50 Euro. When applying a signal with a low amplitude to the designed system, it almost perfectly behaves as a Linear Time Invariant (LTI) device. This is only true whenever the amplitude of the input signal is very small. Increasing the amplitude introduces weak and intuitive nonlinear distortions. This regime of operation is used to illustrate the analysis and estimation methods in a framework that closely approximates the theoretical assumption of periodic in, same period out (PISPO) systems. Increasing the amplitude even further challenges the trainees intuition even more. A sweep up and sweep down sine test shows that the system becomes bistable around the resonance peak which shifts in frequency with increasing amplitude of the input signal. These phenomena are typical for a nonlinear vibrating system containing jumps. The main payback for the trainee is the knowledge that well known Frequency Response Function (FRF) measurement of the mechanical system can indeed be used as an enabler for the nonlinear SI. The experiments shows the need for the detection, quantification and qualification of nonlinear effects. Existing high return local linearization methods[1].},

abstract={Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulation is a technique used extensively in the development and testing of complex real-time embedded systems. Most of the HILs built around the world focus on specific part of a vehicle. This paper describes an in house HIL system developed for the complete hybrid car. In this HIL, the focus was to have HIL based on open hardware which is low cost and modular. It is customizable as per complex interdisciplinary vehicle requirements from Original Equipment Manufacturer that reduces dependency on suppliers and allows testing in an integrated vehicle environment. Code for operating HIL is developed in house. This HIL allows engineers to access ECU and plant model simultaneously and generate test report automatically. It consists of a vehicle plant model developed using MathWorks® Tool chain-MATLAB and Simulink. FPGA Plugin consist of software implementation of vehicle sensors in LabVIEW™ software from National Instruments (NI). NI VeriStand™ provides interface between LabVIEW code and plant model. Each release of vendors' software and functional safety checked in HIL, in an integrated and automated manner, before releasing to production line. This reduces bugs in field and eventually saves money and time to market. Because of early algorithm proving in vehicle development lifecycle, time and resources are saved. HIL has reduced tedious and cumbersome ECU testing on physical vehicle. Functional safety and performance related test cases have been prepared and executed to check redundant safety and fail safe functionality in ECUs, required to meet ISO 26262 standard.

abstract={Wells with high gas/oil ratio (GOR) using progressing cavity pumping (PCP) or rod pumping (RP) typically have a high gas/liquid ratio at the pump intake. For those wells, the use of a downhole gas separator is crucially important to remove as much free gas as possible from the stream reaching the pump. This makes possible to increase pumping volumetric efficiency under reasonable speed conditions and thereby improve well productivity. In applications of PCP is well known that pump performance degradation occurs when handling high fractions of free gas (GVF). Gas blockage, lack of lubricity, reduced heat dissipation, elastomeric swelling, etc., are some of the different problems that occur to the pump before it tear down. Typically the design of downhole gas separator for light or medium crude oil uses separation efficiency values based on empirical trials and settling velocity criteria in biphasic streams. This approach has enabled the industry to mainly develop concentric configurations based on vertical positioning. In the Huyapari field, at least 43% of the wells have free gas at bottomhole conditions in the range of 70-90%. This represents a great opportunity to develop reliable gas separation technologies, looking to improve pump efficiency and run life. This article describes a pilot-scale study of two high GOR wells to evaluate the performance of a "cross flow" downhole gas separator designed for heavy oil production in horizontal wells. This low cost equipment has no moving parts; its configuration is robust, easy to build and simple to be ran in the bottomhole assembly (BHA) at slanted positions. Free gas and liquid separation theory is briefly reviewed to show the most adverse conditions for gas separation present in extraheavy crude oil at field conditions. Production results before and after application showed an increase in the annulus gas rate from 48% up to a range between 55 and 75%. This has promoted improvement in pump efficiency, greater differential pressure in the tubing column and a production increase in the well operating at a lower PCP speed. © 2014, Society of Petroleum Engineers.},

abstract={Foot-launched gliders rely on thermal columns in order to stay in the air. Unfortunately, it can be a very difficult task for a pilot to find these invisible thermals as accurate off-line computation and prediction of air flows is nearly impossible. We therefore propose to wirelessly interconnect hang and paragliders to form a Flying Ad-Hoc Network (FANET). This network enables pilots to collect and exchange live air flow information based on measured vertical climbing rates. Furthermore, we also show how Search and Rescue (SAR) missions can benefit from this technology. In this paper we prove the feasibility of our approach by conducting extensive real life experiments using custom built low-cost hardware. We discuss simulation techniques to efficiently evaluate other FANET applications by modeling the physical channel with its specific characteristics. We identify open challenges and show possible ways to address them in order to deploy an innovative network that could permanently change the sport of gliding. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Gyrotrons are widely used in Electron-Cyclotron Heating systems (ECH) to heat electrons in plasmas. Modern gyrotrons require a precise magnetic field for proper operation which is supplied by an electromagnet with multiple windings. The current for the electromagnet is provided by multiple high-current power supplies. The loss of any one of the power supplies during operation can cause significant and expensive damage to the gyrotron. An independent power supply monitoring system can prevent damage should a magnet power supply fail. This paper presents a magnet current monitor system capable of measuring and monitoring five magnet currents simultaneously. It provides limit tests, an interlock output for power supply failures and a status display for the operator. A self-test feature is included and the measurements and status can be examined through an Ethernet connection. The rapid advance of inexpensive microcontroller technology has led to the development of small microcontroller platforms and associated code libraries that have dramatically decreased the costs and development time required for such projects. This paper describes the use of a popular open-source software, open-hardware platform for the design and fabrication of the magnet current monitor. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Although the environmental benefits of recycling plastics are well established and most geographic locations within the U.S. offer some plastic recycling, recycling rates are often low. Low recycling rates are often observed in conventional centralized recycling plants due to the challenge of collection and transportation for high-volume low-weight polymers. The recycling rates decline further when low population density, rural and relatively isolated communities are investigated because of the distance to recycling centers makes recycling difficult and both economically and energetically inefficient. The recent development of a class of open source hardware tools (e.g. RecycleBots) able to convert post-consumer plastic waste to polymer filament for 3-D printing offer a means to increase recycling rates by enabling distributed recycling. In addition, to reducing the amount of plastic disposed of in landfills, distributed recycling may also provide low-income families a means to supplement their income with domestic production of small plastic goods. This study investigates the environmental impacts of polymer recycling. A life-cycle analysis (LCA) for centralized plastic recycling is compared to the implementation of distributed recycling in rural areas. Environmental impact of both recycling scenarios is quantified in terms of energy use per unit mass of recycled plastic. A sensitivity analysis is used to determine the environmental impacts of both systems as a function of distance to recycling centers. The results of this LCA study indicate that distributed recycling of HDPE for rural regions is energetically favorable to either using virgin resin or conventional recycling processes. This study indicates that the technical progress in solar photovoltaic devices, open-source 3-D printing and polymer filament extrusion have made distributed polymer recycling and upcycling technically viable. © 2013 Materials Research Society.},

However, the aggregate environmental benefits of distributed manufacturing are not clear due to scale reductions and the potential for increases in embodied energy. To quantify the environmental impact of distributed manufacturing using 3D printers, a life cycle analysis was performed on three plastic products. The embodied energy and emissions from conventional large-scale production in low-labor cost countries and shipping are compared to experimental measurements on a RepRap with and without solar photovoltaic (PV) power fabricating products with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA). The results indicate that the cumulative energy demand of manufacturing polymer products can be reduced by 41-64% (55-74% with PV) and concomitant emission reductions using distributed manufacturing with existing low-cost open-source 3D printers when using <25% fill PLA. Less pronounced positive environmental results are observed with ABS, which demands higher temperatures for the print bed and extruder. Overall, the results indicate that distributed manufacturing using open-source 3D printers has the potential to have a lower environmental impact than conventional manufacturing for a variety of products. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={This paper describes a hardware platform aimed at the recently defined White Space Radio spectrum, but, furthermore, to describe how this hardware can also form the basis of a commensal radar system using the emissions of the Whitespace communication system. We envisage White Space communication systems being established in sparsely populated areas to provide communications. This communication network of nodes can be used as nodes of a multistatic network of Radars to track moving targets (especially aerial). The radar system is commensal in that it has no impact on the design and operation of the communications system. The choice of Whitespace spectrum has many advantages. First of all, it will give access to a wide bandwidth, which in turn means better resolution for the commensal radar system. Secondly, the standardization process for Whitespace communication is over. And lastly, this will be a communication system of choice for sparsely populated areas, which are also sites suitable for Radar surveillance. The UHF frequencies of White Space Radio have excellent propagation properties, including foliage penetration. Our development of hardware is because of a dearth of low cost hardware platforms, which are specifically tailored for such a purpose. The proposed platform, named White RHINO (Whitespace Reconfigurable Hardware Interface for ComputiNg and RadiO), envisages to bridge the gap and provide innovators a cost-effective, reliable as well as efficient platform to develop novel solutions for shared spectrum Networked Radar. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The classical way of authentication with a username-password pair is often insufficient: an adversary can choose from a multitude of methods to obtain the credentials, e.g., by guessing passwords using a dictionary, by eavesdropping on network traffic, or by installing malware on the system of the target user. To overcome this problem, numerous solutions incorporating a second factor in the authentication process have been proposed. A particularly wide-spread approach provides each user with a hardware token that generates a One-Time Password (OTP) in addition to the traditional credentials. The token itself comprises a secret cryptographic key that, together with timestamps and counters, is used to derive a fresh OTP for each authentication. A relatively new yet wide-spread example for an OTP token is the Yubikey 2 produced by Yubico. This device employs an open-source protocol based on the mathematically secure AES and emulates a USB keyboard to enter the OTP in a platform-independent manner. In this paper, we analyse the susceptibility of the Yubikey 2 to side-channel attacks. We show that by non-invasively measuring the power consumption and the electro-magnetic emanation of the device, an adversary is able to extract the full 128-bit AES key with approximately one hour of access to the Yubikey 2. The attack leaves no physical traces on the device and can be performed using low-cost equipment. In consequence, an adversary is able to generate valid OTPs, even after the Yubikey 2 has been returned to the owner. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={We report on the design and installation of a spectrometer system for monitoring solar radiation in Cochabamba, Bolivia. Both the light intensity and the spectral distribution affect the power produced by a photovoltaic device. Local variations in the solar spectrum (especially compared to the AM1.5 standard) may have important implications for device optimization and energy yield estimation. The spectrometer system, based on an Ocean Optics USB4000 (300-900nm) spectrometer, was designed to increase functionality. Typically systems only record the global horizontal radiation. Our system moves a fiber-optic cable 0-90 degrees and takes measurements in 9 degree increments. Additionally, a shadow band allows measurement of the diffuse component of the radiation at each position. The electronic controls utilize an Arduino UNO microcontroller to synchronizes the movement of two PAP bipolar (stepper) motors with the activation of the spectrometer via an external trigger. The spectrometer was factory calibrated for wavelength and calibrated for absolute irradiance using a Sellarnet SL1-Cal light source. We present preliminary results from data taken March-June, 2013, and comment on implications for PV devices in Cochabamba. © 2013 SPIE.},

abstract={Currently, a very important issue around the world is to track traffic violations and the resulting accidents, particularly in the railways sector. It is felt that this issue will be under control if somebody could properly monitor/track the individual trains. But this is not possible by individuals manually and so tracking of trains using a special device integrated in the train seems to be a possibility. This integrated device would then warn the train driver to drive safely and also enable periodically updating its location status in a remote controller. In this paper we propose such a real time train tracking system using the global positioning system (GPS) and communication of information through Ethernet Concepts. The system proposed enables communicating the real time information about the train position and also its health conditions based on few sensors attached/integrated. The proposed system would also provide with the complete information about the different trains running, in the video terminal of the controller, using the available internet facilities and the Google mapping Concepts. This proposed system uses a Arduino - A Electronic open Source hardware which provides the complete computation capability for this work. It is felt that this proposed system would provide a solution for a big organization like Indian railways to enable monitoring all their train movements in one place by using internet or through various LAN networks. The locations/positions of all individual vehicles are mapped using their IP addresses, in the Google map wherein each point in the Google map plotted provides the current information about the trains and also the Drivers Alcohol status, max speed, GPS Co-ordinates etc. The design details are provided in the paper. ©2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Stationary CCTV cameras are often used to help monitor car movements and detect any anomalies - e.g., accidents, cars going faster than the allowed speed, driving under the influence of alcohol, etc. The height of the cameras can limit their effectiveness and the types of image processing algorithm which can be used. With advancements in the development of inexpensive aerial flying objects and wireless devices, these two technologies can be coupled to support enhanced surveillance. The flying objects can carry multiple cameras and be sent well above the ground to capture and feed video/image information back to a ground station. In addition, because of the height the objects can achieve, they can capture videos and images which could lend themselves more suitably for the application of a variety of video and image processing algorithms to assist analysts in detecting any anomalies. In this paper, we examine some main challenges of using flying objects for surveillance purposes and propose some potential solutions to these challenges. By doing so, we attempt to provide the basis for developing a framework to build a viable system for improved surveillance based on low-cost equipment. © 2013 IEEE.},

CNTs are directly integrated at the desired positions in the Si microsystem, forming closed Si / CNT / Si circuits. These circuits can show rectifying (Schottky-like) or near-ohmic behavior. A Si / CNT / Si circuit is shown to respond to CO2 presence in Ar atmosphere, indicating the possible of monitoring aging/ fermenting of food packaged in inert atmosphere by a sensor fabricated by the method investigated in this paper. The possibility of functionalization of CNTs is demonstrated, using thermal evaporation of Pd. This opens for selective and sensitive sensors for various gases and analytes. Detailed microscopic characterization of the obtained CNTs are presented. © 2013 IMAPS.},

The characteristics of sensor networks have imposed various restrictions on their system designs.

Under circumstances that a particular commercial subsystem with the exact required specific features is unavailable, the realization of such a prototype can be delayed. In this paper, an example of rapid prototyping for a dual-channel biosignal data acquisition system based on the open-source concept is described. The selected biosignal is the finger photoplethysmogram. Except for Matlab, all other software components are open-source. The hardware design of the optical sensor utilized to record the signals is also open-source, making the system extremely affordable with the advantage of flexibility and customization. Precise timing of the samples allows for proper alignment and delay estimation between the acquired traces, useful in arterial stiffness studies. Although the results presented concern only two channels, the system has the ability to be expanded to six channels. Further possible expansions include the addition of custom filtering, on-board data compression and advanced GUI. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Liquid levels are measured in a variety of agricultural applications, and are often measured manually, which can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. Rapid advances in electronic technologies have made a variety of inexpensive sensing, monitoring, and control capabilities available. A monitoring system was developed and evaluated for automatic measurement of liquid levels, and demonstrated by monitoring water levels in evaporation pans used in evaporation studies and irrigation scheduling. The system is composed of an ultrasonic sensor, a microcontroller-based data logger, and a temperature sensor. The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance from the sensor to the liquid surface. Air temperature is measured by the temperature sensor, and is used to compensate for changes in the speed of sound due to air-temperature variations to improve accuracy of ultrasonic distance measurements. The datalogger is programmed to take measurements and to store data on a memory card which can be downloaded for processing and analysis. All components of the system were assembled in a PVC housing. The system was tested in the field, and resulted in water levels measured by the system corresponding very closely to those measured manually (R2 &gt; 0.98). This system is inexpensive, with total cost of US$85, and easy to build, install, and maintain. In addition to monitoring liquid levels, the system could be adapted to a variety of other measurements.},

The prototype system was tested using the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) that achieved an average speed of 6 ms for processing a single 1024x1024 pixels mammography image. Initial results shows feasibility of using cognitive cells for suspicious breast cancer mass detection in mammograms with superior performances in speed in comparison to other standard methods.

However, the strict constraints in terms of processing power, storage, bandwidth etc. pose a great challenge to data processing in WMSN. In this paper we propose an energy-saving audio data compression technique for WMSN combining wavelet lifting with a newly proposed difference detection technique for an application domain where data are correlated and placed in a 2D grid. In addition to capturing spatial correlation by wavelet, this scheme captures temporal correlation by introducing the difference detection round. A routing scheme is also proposed with a target to reduce energy consumption further. Performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated through analysis on design and simulation results. While analysis on design establishes design feasibility, simulation results evaluate efficacy of the scheme in terms of two conflicting parameters viz. energy consumption and SNR. Finally the comparative results confirm our scheme's supremacy over the competing scheme in both respects. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Direct-conversion radio receivers can provide highly-integrated and low-cost hardware solutions for cognitive radio (CR) devices. However, such receiver structures are also known to suffer from various RF circuit imperfections, especially IQ imbalance. When studying the performance of various spectrum sensing methods, most existing work in literature neglect the effects of such RF imperfections. In this paper, we analyze the performance of a well-known eigenvalue based sensing method, namely maximum-to-minimum eigenvalue test, in the challenging multichannel spectrum sensing context under sensing receiver RF IQ imbalance. It is analytically shown that under RF IQ imbalance, the false alarm probability of the spectrum sensor is always higher compared to ideal RF front-end case. Then, in order to compensate for such degradation in the ability to identify free spectrum, a waveform level interference cancellation solution is deployed to enhance the performance, and optimum cancellation coefficient together with a practical sample estimator are formulated. Extensive computer simulations are provided to illustrate the degradation of false alarm probability in the presence of practical IQ imbalance values. Furthermore, the simulations also show that the proposed interference cancellation method can efficiently suppress the IQ imbalance effects, achieving identical false alarm probability with the ideal RF front-end case. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Wearable sensors are designed to monitor the individual user's activities or the social behaviors within a group. Due to the nature of their applications, the wireless transmission of the sensory data are subject to extremely stringent energy constraints. Also, due to user mobility, the network topology is frequently changing. Therefore, the design of efficient communication protocols for wearable sensor networks is technically challenging. As a fundamental building block of the communication protocol, the power-efficient neighbor discovery mechanism is important for the network to function well. We propose an asynchronous neighbor discovery algorithm, namely, DEPEND (Density-based Power Efficient Neighbor Discovery), which requires neither time synchronization nor carrier sensing, and thus is easy to implement on low cost hardware. DEPEND exploits traditional Quorum-based Power-Saving (QPS) scheme, and incorporates an adaptive mechanism to respond to dynamic node density so as to improve and balance the performance of power saving and neighbor discovery. Each DEPEND-enabled network node calculates the local node density and forecasts the probability that new neighbors enter its communication-range in the near future, and adjusts itself to the most suitable QPS mode to discover new neighbors. Analytical and experimental results show that DEPEND is able to improve the neighbor-discovery performance without consuming much more power, thus the discovery performance and the power efficiency are jointly enhanced. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Time synchronization in wireless sensor networks is important for event ordering and efficient communication scheduling. In this paper, we introduce an external hardwarebased clock tuning circuit that can be used to improve synchronization and significantly reduce clock drift over long periods of time without waking up the host MCU. This is accomplished through two main hardware sub-systems. First, we improve upon the circuit presented in [1] that synchronizes clocks using the ambient magnetic fields emitted from power lines. The new circuit uses an electric field front-end as opposed to the original magnetic-field sensor, which makes the design more compact, lower-power, lower-cost, exhibit less jitter and improves robustness to noise generated by nearby appliances. Second, we present a low-cost hardware tuning circuit that can be used to continuously trim a micro-controller's low-power clock at runtime. Most time synchronization approaches require a CPU to periodically adjust internal counters to accommodate for clock drift. Periodic discrete updates can introduce interpolation errors as compared to continuous update approaches and they require the CPU to expend energy during these wake up periods. Our hardware-based external clock tuning circuit allows the main CPU to remain in a deep-sleep mode for extended periods while an external circuit compensates for clock drift. We show that our new synchronization circuit consumes 60% less power than the original design and is able to correct clock drift rates to within 0.01 ppm without power hungry and expensive precision clocks. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={One of the major obstacles in the study of HRI (human-robot interaction) with social robots is the lack of multiple identical robots that allow testing with large user groups. Often, the price of these robots prohibits using more than a handful. A lot of the commercial robots do not possess all the necessary features to perform specific HRI experiments and due to the closed nature of the platform, large modifications are nearly impossible. While open source social robots do exist, they often use high-end components and expensive manufacturing techniques, making them unsuitable for easy reproduction. To address this problem, a new social robotics platform, named Ono, was developed. The design is based on the DIY mindset of the maker movement, using off-the-shelf components and more accessible rapid prototyping and manufacturing techniques. The modular structure of the robot makes it easy to adapt to the needs of the experiment and by embracing the open source mentality, the robot can be easily reproduced or further developed by a community of users. The low cost, open nature and DIY friendliness of the robot make it an ideal candidate for HRI studies that require a large user group. © Springer International Publishing 2013.},

abstract={The teaching of programming skills to young students is often described by those educators involved as problematic at best. Student issues like mathematical maturity, readiness for complex thought, basic problem solving skills, short attention span especially related to the boredom of traditional programming teaching methodologies, and the lack of exciting problems and their solutions with respect to programming assignments contribute to the angst of many a programming instructor. A small fraction of students who "were just made for programming" always seem to succeed at whatever programming problem is given to them. However, a majority of students, especially precollege and college freshmen tend to have difficulty in overcoming these issues. It is with that observation that something new, in terms of programming pedagogy, needed to be investigated by this paper's authors. An ideal opportunity requiring successful programming instruction for 7-12 graders in the local metropolitan area presented itself in the winter of 2012. The students were involved in a statewide competition where groups of students self-selected into project options offered by various sponsoring institutions. Under the "Technology" choice heading of the state program, the student team and the instructor agreed to program a microprocessor to send messages in International Morse Code. The object of the exercise was to learn basic programming skills and to apply them to solving a problem. The hook was to do something brand new the students had never engaged in, keeping their attention on the end goal, and to see the immediate real-time results of some programming effort along the development cycle as the completed final program took form. The effort was a resounding success; the students learned in a few Saturday morning sessions more about programming than the authors have experienced over weeks of effort in traditional programming classes at the college freshman level. © 2013 ACM.},

However, in order to enable this swift information exchange, it is necessary to make use of digital - technology. Unfortunately, small clinics and health care units do not always have the financial resources to acquire new digital equipment and/or do not want to dispose of their analogical devices. Therefore, alternative methods must be made available. Objective: The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of photographed ECGs (Photo-ECGs) as an alternative tool for facilitating remote cardiologic second opinion. Methods: Three hundred and one paper ECGs were photographed twice (n=602), using a Canon digital camera and a Nokia mobile phone with integrated camera. A series of pilot studies determined the best configuration that should be used for each camera. The Photo-ECGs were then randomized, encrypted and sent (single-blind) to two physicians by email, together with an evaluation form containing gender and age only, while the paper ECGs were delivered personally without randomization. Concordance between results of the paper ECGs and their respective Photo-ECGs were evaluated by the weighted Kappa, giving an average K = 0.508 for the camera Photo-ECGs and an average K = 0.511 for the mobile phone Photo-ECGs. The paper ECG results from each physician were also compared (K = 0.3512). The results of this study suggest that the Photo-ECG has potential for allowing virtual evaluation of ECGs to take place using commonly available and low cost equipment. © 2013 IADIS.},

abstract={The development of powerful and low-cost hardware devices allied with great advances on content editing and authoring tools have promoted the creation of computer generated images (CG) to a degree of unrivaled realism. Differentiating a photo-realistic computer generated image from a real photograph (PG) can be a difficult task to naked eyes. Digital forensics techniques can play a significant role in this task. As a matter of fact, important research has been made by the scientific community in this regard. Most of the approaches focus on single image features aiming at detecting differences between real and computer generated images. However, with the current technology advances, there is no universal image characterization technique that completely solves this problem. In our work, we (1) present a complete study of several CG versus PG approaches; (2) create a large and heterogeneous dataset to be used as a training and validation database; (3) implement representative methods of the literature; and (4) devise automatic ways for combining the best approaches. We compared the implemented methods using the same validation environment showing their pros and cons with a common benchmark protocol. We collected approximately 4850 photographs and 4850 CGs with large diversity of image content and quality. We implemented a total of 13 methods. Results show that this set of methods can achieve up to 93% of accuracy when used without any form of machine learning fusion. The same methods, when combined through the implemented fusion schemes, can achieve an accuracy rate of 97%, representing a reduction of 57% of the classification error over the best individual result. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Scale-freeness, i.e., power-law distribution of node connections, is a fundamental topological property that is highly conserved across biological networks, and as such needs to be manifest within plausible reconstructions of brain connectivity. We demonstrate that scale-free network topology only emerges when adequately fine cortical parcellations are adopted alongside an appropriate correlation threshold, and provide the full design of the first open-source hardware platform to accelerate the calculation of large linear regression arrays. © 2013 IPEM.},

The algorithm is based on the repetitive execution of the selected similarity metric. In this paper, an innovative similarity metric is presented: HwSimilarity. This metric attains high-quality recommendations that are similar to those provided by the best existing metrics and can be processed by employing low-cost hardware circuits.

abstract={Computationally scalable image interpolation algorithm is always desirable for software and hardware implementations on center processing unit (CPU), digital signal processor, field-programmable gate array, and low-cost hardware. A low-complexity, omputationally scalable, and data-adaptive image interpolation algorithm that has a simple and homogeneous structure to efficiently scale the computation is proposed. Specifically, the image interpolation as a denoising problem is formulated by proposing a new image model to relate the observed low-resolution pixels and missing high-resolution pixels. Applying the maximum-likelihood estimation using the new image model results in an adaptive linear filter, where the filter coefficients depend on the local noise covariance matrix, which is estimated by local noise samples. Due to low overhead of the proposed interpolator, the overall computation efficiently scales with the number of noise samples. Experimental results show that the proposed scalable algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art fast algorithms and achieves more than 36 frames per second for upscaling a 540 p (960 × 540) video to a 1080 p (1920 × 1080) video using multithreaded C++ software implementation on a PC system with Intel i7 950 3 GHz CPU. © SPIE and IS&T.},

abstract={Replication is an essential cornerstone of cloud storage where 24×7 availability is needed. Failures are normal rather than exceptional in the cloud computing environments. Aiming to provide high reliability and cost effective storage, replicating based on data popularity is an advisable choice. Before committing a service level agreement (SLA) to the customers of a cloud, the service provider needs to carry out analysis of the system on which cloud storage is hosted. Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is an open source storage platform and designed to be deployed in low-cost hardware. PC Cluster based Cloud Storage System is implemented with HDFS by enhancing replication management scheme. Data objects are distributed and replicated in a cluster of commodity nodes located in the cloud. In this paper, we propose a Markov chain model for replication system which is able to adapt the load changes of cloud storage. According to the performance evaluation, the system can be able to adapt the different workloads (i.e data access rates) while maintaining the high reliability and long mean time to absorption.},

abstract={Approximately 10%-20% of people have Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) worldwide. It is well known that IBS is associated with altered motility of the intestine. Currently, the diagnosis of IBS is made through expensive invasive radiographic and endoscopic examinations. The bowel sounds (BSs) are produced by the propelled-air during peristalsis, and can be easily recorded using non-invasive and low-cost equipment. In this study we propose a novel autoregressive moving average (ARMA)-based method to automatically detect BSs, and we use the measure, BS duration (BSD), to capture gastrointestinal motor activity. The performance of the proposed method is investigated and evaluated via computer simulations. Working on healthy volunteers during mosapride administrations, we show that the proposed method for automatic detection could achieve a sensitivity of 83.4%, specificity of 93.3% and accuracy of 91.2%. Moreover, we show that the measure BSD can conveniently capture gastrointestinal motor activity. Our findings should have the potential to contribute towards developing bowel-sound based diagnosis of IBS.},

abstract={With the source and detector kept stationary while an inspected object moves between them, straight-line-trajectory-based tomographic imaging (SLTTI) has the capability to provide both digital radiologic images and tomographic images simultaneously, at high speed and with low-cost equipment. It has a promising future for fast security inspection for air cargo examinations. In order to fully investigate the feasibility of this approach, an experimental SLTTI platform has been developed. In this work, the system design is first presented. Then, a hybrid image reconstruction algorithm is proposed to obtain high quality tomographic images from the system to solve the limited-angle problem it represents. In the proposed algorithm, an initial reconstruction using either a direct filtered-backprojection (FBP) -type algorithm or the linogram technique is followed by a Gerchberg-Papoulis (GP) extrapolation to compensate for missing data. The GP extrapolation is implemented by the linogram technique, and constrained by a total variation (TV) minimization. By taking advantage of the FBP, the linogram and the TV techniques, we establish a fast and stable iterative reconstruction for the SLTTI. Finally, numerical simulations and realistic experiments are given, through which our proposals are validated to be feasible and effective. In the numerical examples, our algorithm can reduce the reconstruction inaccuracies for both high contrast and low contrast objects by factors of more than 15 and can generate nearly artifact free images as if complete projection data were available. A realistic experiment on a CatPhan©600 phantom suggests that high quality tomographic images can be achieved from 120-deg of source fan-beam angle with undersampled data. For a group of explosive simulacra using 90 projection views over 120-deg of source fan-beam angle, the reconstruction inaccuracy can be reduced to lower than 4%. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={An increasing number of applications require 3D content. However, its creation from real-world data either necessitates expensive equipment, artistic skills, or is constrained, for example, by the range of the utilized sensors. Image-based modeling is rapidly increasing in popularity since cameras are very affordable, widely available, and have a wide image acquisition range suitable for objects of vastly different size. The technique is especially suitable for mobile robotics involving low cost equipment and robots with a light payload, for example, small UAVs. In this paper we describe a novel image-based modeling system, which produces high-quality 3D content automatically from a collection of unconstrained and uncalibrated 2D images. The system estimates camera parameters and a 3D scene geometry using Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Bundle Adjustment techniques. The point cloud density of 3D scene components is enhanced by exploiting silhouette information of the scene. This hybrid approach dramatically improves the reconstruction of objects with few visual features, for example, unicolored objects, and improves surface smoothness. A high quality texture is created by parameterizing the reconstructed objects using a segmentation and charting approach which also works for objects which are not homeomorphic to a sphere. The resulting parameter space contains one chart for each surface segment. A texture map is created by back projecting the best fitting input images onto each surface segment, and smoothly fusing them together over the corresponding chart by using graph-cut techniques. © 2013 IEEE.},

At the same time there exists no dedicated technique to perform its quality assessment and engineers are forced to rely on subjective figures such as verification test quality metrics or just the size of the diagnostic test. This paper has proposed two new approaches for assessing diagnostic capability of diagnostic tests for automated bug localization. The first approach relies on probabilistic simulation of diagnostic experiments. The second assessment method is based on calculating Hamming distances of the individual sub-tests in the diagnostic test set. The methods are computationally cheap and they provide for a measure of confidence in the localization results and allow estimating impact of the diagnostic test enhancement. The approach is implemented as a part of an open-source hardware design and debugging framework zamiaCAD. Experimental results with an industrial processor design and a set of documented bugs demonstrate feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Data replication increases data availability in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs). Preventing data loss and increasing data availability in MANETs is a nontrivial problem due to their low-cost hardware, harsh working environments, node mobility, failure of mobile devices from battery exhaustion and node compromise attacks. In addition, different routing algorithms and larger size of the network can cause communication links to fail creating several disjoint partitions which causes data loss. The typical fault-tolerant systems would fail in these conditions. Existing approaches fail due to the limitations caused by their dependence on lower node mobility or constrained by node distribution, unpredictable partitions and routing mechanisms. In this paper, we propose Combinatorial Replication and Partition (CORP) of data which is a combinatorial arrangement with pair wise balanced design property to prevent data loss and increase data availability. Our scheme provides low access latency and reduces communication overhead. By partitioning and replicating data in such a combinatorial arrangement, our scheme directly supports object-oriented constructs in distributed fault-tolerant networks. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Pneumatic isolation tables are generally used in the fields of manufacturing and measuring precision components, and several methods by which to achieve active control of pneumatic isolation tables have been proposed. In these studies, the internal pressure of the air springs is actively controlled by using servo valves in order to suppress micro-level vibration. On the other hand, so as to suppress millimeter-level vibration and obtain low cost equipment, several methods by which to achieve active control using on-off valves instead of servo valves have been proposed. In these investigations, a switching control method based on the Lyapunov function exhibits performances that are superior to the other methods. However, the switching control method suppresses vibrations in only the vertical direction. Therefore, improvement of the vibration suppression performance is required in not only the vertical direction but also the rolling and pitching directions. Thus, the purpose of this study is to obtain high vibration suppression performance for a pneumatic isolation table with three degrees-of-freedom using on-off valves. The switching control method is extended to multi-input system, and it is shown that the extended method is suitable for control of a pneumatic isolation table with three degrees-of-freedom. The effects of the extended method are verified by numerical simulations and experiments. © 2013 The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers.},

abstract={Ethernet is widely recognized as an attractive networking technology for modern distributed real-time systems. However, standard Ethernet components require specific modifications and hardware support to provide strict latency guarantees necessary for safety-critical applications. Although this is a well-stated fact, the design of hardware components for real-time communication remains mostly unexplored. This becomes evident from the few solutions reporting prototypes and experimental validation, which hinders the consolidation of Ethernet in real-world distributed applications. This paper presents Atacama, the first open-source framework based on reconfigurable hardware for mixed-criticality communication in multi-segmented Ethernet networks. Atacama uses specialized modules for time-triggered communication of real-time data, which seamlessly integrate with a standard infrastructure using regular best-effort traffic. Atacama enables low and highly predictable communication latency on multi-segmented 1Gbps networks, easy optimization of devices for specific application scenarios, and rapid prototyping of new protocol characteristics. Researchers can use the open-source design to verify our results and build upon the framework, which aims to accelerate the development, validation, and adoption of Ethernet-based solutions in real-time applications. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The combination of OFDM with joint pre-processing in adaptive multi-antenna systems offers both an ease of equalization in frequency-selective channels and keeping the signal processing at the mobile stations simple. In addition, the spatial dimension can be efficiently exploited to ensure high system throughput. With the utilization of higher-order modulation the performance of the system is highly sensitive to multiple access interference and nonorthogonal subchannels due to hardware impairments or insufficient adaptation to the current channel conditions. A further source of error in TDD systems are the non-reciprocal transceivers inhibiting the baseband-to-baseband channel reciprocity required for accurate channel state acquisition based on the uplink channel estimate. In this paper, measurement results of a low-cost hardware-based calibration are presented and the drawbacks are discussed leading to the utilization of a recently introduced relative calibration. The latter is applied to an OFDM system and achieves or at least approximates the baseband-to-baseband reciprocity. Thus, it enables the link adaptation using the uplink channel state information. Furthermore, preliminary hardware implementations of the relative calibration running on a real-time system show accurate results. © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Approximately 10%-20% of adults and adolescents suffer from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) worldwide. IBS is characterized by chronic gastrointestinal dysfunction which may reflect in altered motility. Currently, the diagnosis of IBS is made through expensive invasive radiographic and endoscopic examinations. However these are inconvenient and unsuited for community screening. Bowel sounds (BSs) can be easily recorded with non-invasive and low-cost equipment. Recently, several researchers have pointed out changes in features obtained from BS according to the pathological condition of bowel motility. However a widely accepted, simple automatic BS detection algorithm still has to be found, and the appropriate recording period needs to be investigated for further evaluation of bowel motility. In this study we propose a novel simple automatic method to detect the BSs based on the 3 dB bandwidth of the frequency peaks in the autoregressive moving average spectrum. We use the measure, sound-to-sound interval (SSI) obtained by the proposed method, to capture bowel motility. In this paper, we show that the proposed method for automatic detection could achieve a sensitivity of 87.8±5.88%, specificity of 91.7±4.33% and area under the curve of 0.923 when working on 16 healthy volunteers during mosapride administrations. Furthermore, we show that the measured SSI averaged over a period of 30 min can clearly capture bowel motility. Our findings should have the potential to contribute toward developing automated BS-based diagnosis of IBS. © 2013 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.},

abstract={The rapid detection and identification of infectious disease pathogens is a critical need for healthcare in both developed and developing countries. As we gain more insight into the genomic basis of pathogen infectivity and drug resistance, point-of-care nucleic acid testing will likely become an important tool for global health. In this paper, we present an inexpensive, handheld, battery-powered instrument designed to enable pathogen genotyping in the developing world. Our Microfluidic Biomolecular Amplification Reader (μBAR) represents the convergence of molecular biology, microfluidics, optics, and electronics technology. The μBAR is capable of carrying out isothermal nucleic acid amplification assays with real-time fluorescence readout at a fraction of the cost of conventional benchtop thermocyclers. Additionally, the μBAR features cell phone data connectivity and GPS sample geotagging which can enable epidemiological surveying and remote healthcare delivery. The μBAR controls assay temperature through an integrated resistive heater and monitors real-time fluorescence signals from 60 individual reaction chambers using LEDs and phototransistors. Assays are carried out on PDMS disposable microfluidic cartridges which require no external power for sample loading. We characterize the fluorescence detection limits, heater uniformity, and battery life of the instrument. As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrate the detection of the HIV-1 integrase gene with the μBAR using the Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) assay. Although we focus on the detection of purified DNA here, LAMP has previously been demonstrated with a range of clinical samples, and our eventual goal is to develop a microfluidic device which includes on-chip sample preparation from raw samples. The μBAR is based entirely around open source hardware and software, and in the accompanying online supplement we present a full set of schematics, bill of materials, PCB layouts, CAD drawings, and source code for the μBAR instrument with the goal of spurring further innovation toward low-cost genetic diagnostics. © 2013 Myers et al.},

abstract={The field of wireless communication has become the hottest area and Software Defined Radio (SDR) is revolutionizing it. By bringing much functionality as software, SDR reduces the cost of hardware maintenance and up-gradation. Open source hardware such as USRP (Universal Software Radio Peripheral) and software called GNU Radio-Companion are commonly used to do experiments in SDR. Since the cost of USRP is high, a low cost set up is needed which is affordable by the student community. In this paper a low cost alternative to USRP is proposed using RTL-SDR (Realtek Software Defined Radio) which is only used for reception. For transmitting purpose, a mixer circuit can be used to map the baseband signal to the band that can be received by RTL-SDR on the other end on Linux / Windows platform. Initially, the experiment is done in simulation. After that, it is tested with low cost hardware such as mixer and RTL-SDR. The cost for total transceiver system can be less than USD 100 which is 10 times less than the existing one. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Mechanomyogram (MMG) signals are the mechanical signals obtained from muscles during contractions. They are less sensitive to skin impedance, sensor placement and require only low cost hardware to process the signal. Till date there are only very few applications in which MMG signals are used. The work aims at development of a standalone system for generating control signals required to drive assistive devices which provide support for disabled and elderly people. This paper presents the initial phase of the work, which focuses on the development of a fuzzy classifier. The classifier is developed to categorize the different speeds of elbow movements into rest, slow and fast. For this, MMG signal from biceps brachii are acquired and processed. Two time-domain features namely, mean absolute value and variance are extorted from the segmented data and is given to the fuzzy inference system. The average accuracy of the classifier is found to be 72.72%. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={There is no alternative of visual percepts to brain for accomplishing any easy to complex problem solution. Sustaining in the everyday world environment demands a lot from visual information processing of brain. But a large number of the human being is devoid of the blessings of visual percepts due to biological or accidental causes. This paper presents a critique on vision aided systems and suggests an inexpensive alternative to develop an aided system for visually impaired persons. We propose a real-time solution which utilizes image processing methodology and low cost hardware to support the visually impaired for every day path navigation and obstacle avoidance. A head mounted camera processes the image to identify plausible path and obstacle. The identified path direction and obstacle are converted into pre-defined vocabularies with audio annotation output to the physically challenged people's ears. This method has been tested over varying environmental conditions and is found to be effective for visually impaired navigation. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={We present a satellite attitude control system design using low-cost hardware and software for a 1U CubeSat. The attitude control system architecture is a crucial subsystem for any satellite mission since precise pointing is often required to meet mission objectives. The accuracy and precision requirements are even more challenging for small satellites where limited volume, mass, and power are available for the attitude control system hardware. In this proposed embedded attitude control system design for a 1U CubeSat, pointing is obtained through a two-stage approach involving coarse and fine control modes. Fine control is achieved through the use of three reaction wheels or three magnetorquers and one reaction wheel along the pitch axis. Significant design work has been conducted to realize the proposed architecture. In this paper, we present an overview of the embedded attitude control system design; the verification results from numerical simulation studies to demonstrate the performance of a CubeSat-class nanosatellite; and a series of air-bearing verification tests on nanosatellite attitude control system hardware that compares the performance of the proposed nonlinear controller with a proportional-integral-derivative controller. © 2013 Junquan Li et al.},

abstract={The need of large-scale monitoring of power quality (PQ) in electrical power systems require the design of reliable and cost-effective measurement instruments. In this framework, Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) architectures seem to offer valid solutions since they allow powerful measurement algorithms to be implemented on low-cost hardware with reconfigurable firmware. This paper proposes a FPGA-based measurement instrument for harmonic and interharmonic monitoring in compliance with the most important PQ standards. Key feature of the proposed instrument is the very low requirements of hardware and firmware FPGA resources, thus making it suitable for applications that require cost-effective measurements. The proposed instrument shows performance comparable with one of the powerful and more expensive measurement solutions available on the market. In particular, despite the absence of a sampling frequency synchronization system, the proposed instrument proves to be compliant with IEC 61000-4-30, even in the presence of huge frequency deviations. After a description of the proposed hardware and firmware solutions, the experimental characterization of the proposed instrument in emulated and real environments is reported. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Future microprocessors need low-cost solutions for reliable operation in the presence of failure-prone devices. A promising approach is to detect hardware faults by deploying low-cost software-level symptom monitors. However, there remains a nonnegligible risk that several faults might escape these detectors to produce silent data corruptions (SDCs). Evaluating and bounding SDCs is, therefore, crucial for low-cost resiliency solutions. The authors present Relyzer, an approach that can systematically analyze all application fault sites and identify virtually all SDC-causing program locations. Instead of performing fault injections on all possible application-level fault sites, which is impractical, Relyzer carefully picks a small subset. It employs novel fault-pruning techniques that reduce the number of fault sites by either predicting their outcomes or showing them equivalent to others. Results show that 99.78 percent of faults are pruned across 12 studied workloads, reducing the complete application resiliency evaluation time by 2 to 6 orders of magnitude. Relyzer, for the first time, achieves the capability to list virtually all SDC-vulnerable program locations, which is critical in designing low-cost application-centric resiliency solutions. Relyzer also opens new avenues of research in designing error-resilient programming models as well as even faster (and simpler) evaluation methodologies. © 1981-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Early industrialism was influenced by the organization of cottage industries, and in a similar vein, many of today's creative industries emerge largely from networked small-scale initiatives or cultural scenes. Collaborations and interactions are the backbone of the contemporary Do-It-Yourself (DIY) or 'maker culture', a distributed milieu of open software programmers and hardware hackers, but also crafters, backyard tinkerers, hobbyists and homesteaders. The scene is held together by micro-management tactics, or 'molecular' management, using protocols to guide collaborative innovation and shared craft practices, forming an emergent and innovative creative cottage industry. The maker culture is thus less of a DIY and more a do-it-together culture, merging collaborative play and interactions, often for the sake of shared curiosity. The mindset of the participants is that of the explorative craftsman; using a practical attitude of sharing ideas, methods and skills among practitioners, and the interactions are managed in a flat and meshworked manner through the use of protocols. The text specifically examines the protocols of the maker movement, finding an immediate connection between hardware protocols, like the 'makers bill of rights' guiding the principles of open source hardware, and the principles reflected in the social protocols of two hacker spaces. The maker culture is not only a loose network of dispersed tinkerers, it is also a close-knit molecular assemblage of materials, tools, skills and makers. © 2012 Intellect Ltd Editorial.

abstract={While 3D video for movies and TV shows has been studied throughout the twentieth century, stereoscopy for multimedia services has received much less attention. While not a key component of the general 3D market, such services become very important for mobile stereoscopy: with a mobile device, the 3D effect is most of the time experienced by a single user, which enables more types of services, such as gaming or interactive viewing of models or maps. In this chapter, we study how such stereoscopic multimedia services can be expressed with existing languages, as well as a new concept introduced in order to enhance the 3D effects while keeping content creation simple, and we review a simple GPU-based prototype of such a stereoscopic multimedia system. Moreover, most investigations on stereoscopy for mobile displays work with side-by-side encoded video to be displayed on a stereo screen. While this covers the basic need for 3D video, it does not address 3D displays with a higher number of views. Upcoming 3D video standards have understood this limitation and offer both color and depth information for each pixel of the video, but most of the time view synthesis is achieved by a costly mix of CPU and GPU usage. Additionally, synthetic graphics generation for multiview display using traditional techniques (one or more rendering passes per view) is most of the time too computational for the device. In this chapter, we describe a low-cost hardware design in charge of performing the view synthesis operations from depth and color information, implemented on a field-programmable gate array; the algorithms used for the synthesis are detailed, as well as some of our approaches towards enhancing the visual quality of the generated views. © 2013 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Uneven knowledge distribution is often an issue in remote support systems, creating the occasional need for additional information layers that extend beyond plain videoconference and shared workspaces. This paper introduces SEMarbeta, a remote support system designed for car drivers in need of help from an officebound professional expert. We introduce a design concept and its technical implementation using low-cost hardware and techniques inspired by augmented reality research. In this setup, the driver uses a portable Android tablet PC while the expert mechanic uses a stationary computer equipped with a video camera capturing his gestures and sketches. Hence, verbal instructions can be combined with supportive gestures and sketches added by the expert mechanic to the car's video display. To validate this concept, we carried out a user study involving two typical automotive repair tasks: checking engine oil and examining fuses. Based on these tasks and following a between-group (drivers and expert mechanics) design, we compared voice-only with additional sketch- and gesture-overlay on video screenshots measuring objective and perceived quality of help. Results indicate that sketch- and gesture-overlay can benefit remote car support in typical breakdown situations. Copyright 2013 ACM.},

abstract={The high cost of what have historically been sophisticated research-related sensors and tools has limited their adoption to a relatively small group of well-funded researchers. This paper provides a methodology for applying an open-source approach to design and development of a colorimeter. A 3-D printable, open-source colorimeter utilizing only open-source hardware and software solutions and readily available discrete components is discussed and its performance compared to a commercial portable colorimeter. Performance is evaluated with commercial vials prepared for the closed reflux chemical oxygen demand (COD) method. This approach reduced the cost of reliable closed reflux COD by two orders of magnitude making it an economic alternative for the vast majority of potential users. The open-source colorimeter demonstrated good reproducibility and serves as a platform for further development and derivation of the design for other, similar purposes such as nephelometry. This approach promises unprecedented access to sophisticated instrumentation based on low-cost sensors by those most in need of it, under-developed and developing world laboratories. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Print management solutions are necessary for organizations that need to monitor, report and charge printing or photocopying usage, especially in large domains where business goals require streamlined procedures. High-end print management systems offer integrated credit reception and efficient, parametrized accounting for the use of resources. The usage of printers and photocopy machines is controlled and monitored, and, through the latter, waste elimination is achieved. Print management inherently conforms with the rationale and mentality of green and eco-friendly technologies that also relate with the ethos of the open source movement in IT. One would expect that open source print management solutions would thrive; however, the vast majority of integrated management systems are commercial. There is only a small number of valuable open source print accounting solutions, but there are none that integrate accounting with a form of credit reception. This paper presents the design of an open system that integrates the provision of automated credit reception with accounting services in order to produce an open solution that fully automates the business process of print charging. The objective is to design the necessary automations for credit reception so that it can be realized without any human intervention, to plan the integration with a suitable open print accounting system and to specify any complementary utilities and tools necessary for production installations. © 2007-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={For many years robotics has been benefited from the open source community. Software community projects like Player, Stage, Gazebo, ROS, or OpenCV are present in most robotic applications. In recent years this trend has also been initiated among electronic and mechanical developments (open hardware). The Arduino development platform is a good example of a successful hardware project with a great community of developers and users around it. The apparition of personal 3D printers is bringing the open source philosophy to the fabrication of physical things as well. This new technology is in need of new designing tools to take advantage of it. In this paper we are presenting the C++ Object Oriented Mechanics Library (OOML), a tool to design mechanical components, taking into account the needs and requirements of these emerging technologies. These designs can be easily shared, reused, and modified. The OOML brings together the advantages of (1) modelling things through code, (2) the object oriented programming paradigm, and (3) the power of C++. In the OOML, mechanical parts are described as geometrical combinations of basic primitives. Once a part is defined, fabrication files can be generated in order to print, or mechanize it. Models could also be used for simulation, visualization, structural analysis, etc. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Just as the power of the open-source design paradigm has driven down the cost of software to the point that it is accessible to most people, the rise of open-source hardware is poised to drive down the cost of doing experimental science to expand access to everyone. To assist in this aim, this paper introduces a library of open-source 3-D-printable optics components. This library operates as a flexible, low-cost public-domain tool set for developing both research and teaching optics hardware. First, the use of parametric open-source designs using an open-source computer aided design package is described to customize the optics hardware for any application. Second, details are provided on the use of open-source 3-D printers (additive layer manufacturing) to fabricate the primary mechanical components, which are then combined to construct complex optics-related devices. Third, the use of the open-source electronics prototyping platform are illustrated as control for optical experimental apparatuses. This study demonstrates an open-source optical library, which significantly reduces the costs associated with much optical equipment, while also enabling relatively easily adapted customizable designs. The cost reductions in general are over 97%, with some components representing only 1% of the current commercial investment for optical products of similar function. The results of this study make its clear that this method of scientific hardware development enables a much broader audience to participate in optical experimentation both as research and teaching platforms than previous proprietary methods. © 2013 Zhang et al.},

Therefore, in this paper two new methods are presented which can be realized with low-cost hardware and software.

For this reason, this work discusses the determination of the provenance of Argentinean Sauvignon blanc wines by the use of UV spectroscopy and chemometric methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA), cluster analysis (CA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). The proposed method requires low-cost equipment and short-time analysis in comparison with other techniques.

abstract={In the search for new paradigms to simplify multithreaded programming, Transactional Memory (TM) is currently being advocated as a promising alternative to lock-based synchronization. Among the two most important alternatives proposed for conflict detection and data versioning in today's Hardware Transactional Memory systems (HTMs), the Lazy-Lazy one allows increased concurrency, potentially bringing higher performance levels in most cases. Unfortunately, the implementation of the commit protocol in Lazy-Lazy systems results in increased complexity and has severe impact on performance and energy consumption. In this work, we propose GCommit, an efficient and low cost hardware implementation of the SEQ commit protocol based on the use of hardware locks. Specifically, GCommit deploys hardware locks to ensure exclusive access to shared data at commit time. Implementing this functionality using dedicated hardware brings important benefits in terms of execution time as well as energy consumption with respect to traditional commit protocols that use the general-purpose interconnection network . Additionally, our proposal has negligible requirements in terms of area. Results for a 16-core CMP show that the GCommit protocol obtains average reductions of 15.7% and 13.7% in terms of execution time and energy consumption, respectively, compared with a traditional implementation of Scalable TCC with SEQ, a high-performance commit protocol proposed in the literature. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

OpenPMU achieves this through open-source hardware design specifications and software source code, allowing duplicates of the OpenPMU to be fabricated under open-source licenses. This paper presents the OpenPMU device based on the Labview development environment. The device is performance tested according to the IEEE C37.118.1 standard. Compatibility with the IEEE C37.118.2 messaging format is achieved through middleware which is readily adaptable to other PMU projects or applications. Improvements have been made to the original design to increase its flexibility.

This leads to the necessity to adapt old hardware. Most of the microcontrollers used in the old hardware do not offer any support of the new interfaces and have to be replaced. A simple and efficient way is to replace them with open hardware microcontroller boards like the Arduino. These boards are based on 8-bit RISC microcontrollers and offer a software development environment with a large number of libraries.

abstract={Background: Stroke affects approximately 800,000 individuals each year, with 65% having residual impairments. Studies have demonstrated that mass practice leads to regaining motor function in affected extremities; however, traditional therapy does not include the repetitions needed for this recovery. Videogames have been shown to be good motivators to complete repetitions. Advances in technology and low-cost hardware bring new opportunities to use computer games during stroke therapy. This study examined the use of the Microsoft (Redmond, WA) Kinect™ and Flexible Action and Articulated Skeleton Toolkit (FAAST) software as a therapy tool to play existing free computer games on the Internet. Subjects and Methods: Three participants attended a 1-hour session where they played two games with upper extremity movements as game controls. Video was taken for analysis of movement repetitions, and questions were answered about participant history and their perceptions of the games. Results: Participants remained engaged through both games; regardless of previous computer use all participants successfully played two games. Five minutes of game play averaged 34 repetitions of the affected extremity. The Intrinsic Motivation Inventory showed a high level of satisfaction in two of the three participants. Conclusions: The Kinect Sensor with the FAAST software has the potential to be an economical tool to be used alongside traditional therapy to increase the number of repetitions completed in a motivating and engaging way for clients. © Copyright 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2013.},

abstract={Uranium deposits were recovered at the solid cathode of an electrorefining system, and deposited uranium dendrite normally contains about 30-40 wt% LiCl-KCl eutectic salts. Therefore, a separation of the eutectic salts from deposited uranium is essential for reusing these salts and uranium. A process such as distillation was employed for cathode processing due to the advantages of a minimal generation of secondary waste, a compact unit process, and simple and low-cost equipment. However, the realization of a wide evaporation area or high distillation temperature is limited by various factors such as the material or structure of a distiller. Also, the electrical energy flow from outside has a lot of consumption to maintain the high temperature. Hence, in this study, solid-liquid separation experiments are proposed to increase the throughput of the salt removal process by the separation of the liquid salt prior to the distillation of the LiCl-KCl eutectic salt. The solid-liquid separation of salt was carried out in a vertical type distiller. The behavior of the solid-liquid separation of pure eutectic salt was investigated as a function of temperature, pressure, sieve size, and crucible shape. From the experimental results using pure eutectic salts, the amount of salt separation was achieved at more than 94 wt%. The rate of solid-liquid separation of salt using 600 C is higher than that of 500 C under the same condition. The influence of a vacuum for solid-liquid separation can be disregarded, and the separation rate of a 100 mesh was higher than that of a 150 mesh. In addition, the rate of separation for salts using a porous crucible is higher than that in a non-porous crucible. © 2012 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

The initial work done by ICFOSS for soil and atmosphere monitoring sensor networks, where the sensors had wired connections within each node, had limited their deployment to very short distances around the node. A hybrid approach using a mesh network consisting of 'motes'-based sensors is proposed in conjunction with the Raspberry Pi-based management layer to un-tether the sensors, leading to simplified field-based deployments. This approach enables multiple applications such as remote monitoring for disaster management, precision agriculture, wildlife monitoring or pollution monitoring in urban areas. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Since its introduction in 1992, Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) has evolved to become a worldwide standard in mobile telephony. Security in GSM, albeit being one of the most important issues, has not yet been scrutinized to a level it deserves owing mainly to the expensive hardware requirements and lack of thorough understanding of GSM protocols in general. This scenario is changing significantly with the growing rate of development of open-source tools, which can serve to harness the RF signaling and enable processing on a general purpose workstation. In this paper, these open-source tools are utilized to study the feasibility of developing a GSM Protocol Analyzer and investigating the theoretical security protocols and procedures through practical implementation of such system. Universal Software Programmable Radio Peripheral (USRP) was selected as the RF frontend for the protocol analyzer. The USRP is a general purpose, open-hardware transceiver that can be linked to a workstation via an RJ45 Gigabit Ethernet link. Various open-source software, based primarily on GNU Radio, are then utilized to synchronize, demodulate and decode the received signal. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Outdoor air pollution now contributes annually to over 3.2 million premature deaths worldwide and is among the top health risk factors. Urban air pollution is on course to become the top environmental cause of mortality by 2050 - greater than the effects of dirty water and lack of sanitation. This risk is especially high in developing countries, where it is often difficult or expensive to obtain air quality data. This paper outlines the initial development of a system for mapping crowd-sourced air quality data in urban environments in developing countries. This system includes a (1) low cost wearable air quality monitor and (2) a mapping and data visualization web application for use in urban settings in developing countries. Based on open source hardware and software, the air quality monitor is composed of an Arduino microcontroller and sensor shields and collects real-time geographically explicit air quality data, with data storage on removable memory. The mapping and data visualization web application uses javascript functions and Google Maps API to visualize the paths travelled and the intensity of ozone and particulate matter as a heat map. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={For rural areas, wireless is the only viable alternative for providing affordable telecommunications services. One limiting factor to the growth of wireless broadband penetration is the lack of available spectrum. White Spaces broadband uses gaps in spectrum bands that have been reserved for TV broadcasts. These frequencies offer significant capacity to help alleviate pressures on existing wireless networks and allow connectivity in remote areas due to their good propagation capabilities. This paper describes an assessment study on TV White Spaces availability in Malawi using affordable tools. The conclusion of the study is that 1) it is possible to assess the spectrum usage using low cost equipment 2) ample spectrum for TV White Spaces deployment is available in Malawi. © 2013 IEEE.},

Until 2012, thanks to the excellent performances of the injection system of the storage ring, the perturbation on the position of the stored beam during Top-up injection was small enough to be accepted by the users. For some specific experiments requesting higher beam stability, few beamlines expressed their wish to be able to freeze the data acquisition during the injection. To fulfill this need, the diagnostics group of Synchrotron SOLEIL designed the "TimEX3" board which was integrated into the timing system in order to allow the gating of the Top-up injection. This design was released as open hardware. Towards this aim, we decided to design it with the open source and free EDA software "KiCad", and to make it available under the CERN's Open Hardware Repository. Copyright © 2013 by JACoW.},

abstract={The FireFader is a simple haptic force-feedback device that is optimized for introducing musicians to haptics. It is based upon a single-degree-of- freedom potentiometer fader coupled to a DC motor, also known as a "motorized fader." A light is connected in parallel with the motor to help communicate the force's strength visually. The FireFader consists of only open-source hardware and open-source software elements. Consequently, it is relatively easy for users to repurpose it into new projects involving varying kinds and numbers of motors and sensors. An open-source device driver for the FireFader allows it to be linked to a computer via USB so that the computer can perform the feedback control calculations. For example, the computer can simulate the acoustics of a virtual musical instrument to concurrently synthesize sound and calculate the motor force as a function of the fader position. The serial connection over USB increases the latency of the control signal compared to embedded implementations, but the serial connection facilitates easier programming via the computer, and the force feedback can be automatically disabled when the user is not touching the fader. Some new devices derived from the FireFader design are presented. © 2013 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

abstract={3DP (Three Dimensional Printing) technology is one of the SFF (Solid Freeform Fabrication) technologies which have recently come into the spotlight due to its adaptability to various applications. However, commercial 3DP machines are limited as to the use of building material, without voiding the warranty on the machine. At the same time, a rise in domestic rapid prototyping machines is observed, but none of these machines use the 3DP process. Therefore, an open source 3DP machine is designed and built. In this study, the machine is discussed and the first experiments are carried out to create ceramic (alumina and zirconia) membranes with specific physical properties. The purpose for developing this machine was opening up the opportunity to investigate printing ceramic membranes and reactors. Were, contrary to many other applications, maximal compaction of the powder during deposition is not desirable, to maintain an open structure the walls of the printed object. The machine is able to deposit the powder with adjustable bulk density, which is used to alter the properties of the membrane.

abstract={With the growing need of the high quality image captured by the camera in smartphones and other portable equipment, it is necessary to implement the demosaicking algorithm hardcore into the embedded system to balance the tradeoff between the power and performance. However, current demosaicking algorithms either produce poor image quality due to their focus on low cost hardware, or are too complex to be implemented into the embedded system. In this paper, we propose a cost effective demosaicking algorithm based on edge-orientation map and realize the algorithm in hardware. The proposed algorithm can reduce great hardware cost by adjusting the interpolation flow and simplifying the topology of edge-orientation map. The algorithm has been verified to be high performance by subjective measurement and color peak signal to noise ratio (CPSNR) and has been implemented in Altera FPGA with greatly reduced resources and a real time speed of 200MHz. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Technical progress in the open-source self replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) community has enabled a distributed form of additive manufacturing to expand rapidly using polymer-based materials. However, the lack of an open-source metal alternative and the high capital costs and slow throughput of proprietary commercialized metal 3-D printers has severely restricted their deployment. The applications of commercialized metal 3-D printers are limited to only rapid prototyping and expensive nished products. This severely restricts the access of the technology for small and medium enterprises, the developing world and for use in laboratories. This paper reports on the development of a 2000 open-source metal 3-D printer. The metal 3-D printer is controlled with an open-source micro-controller and is a combination of a low-cost commercial gas-metal arc welder and a derivative of the Rostock, a deltabot RepRap. The bill of materials, electrical and mechanical design schematics, and basic construction and operating procedures are provided. A preliminary technical analysis of the properties of the 3-D printer and the resultant steel products are performed.

The second contribution is the improved performance in terms of resolution and search range achieved by adaptive frame interval and advanced search algorithm. The final contribution is a systematical strategy for parameter selection to fully utilize the hardware resources and optimize the performance in different contexts.

The pilot project for this initiative is the Multi-Purpose Avionics Core Element (M-PACE). The primary goal of M-PACE is to demonstrate advanced manufacturing techniques, such as additive manufacturing and Digital Materials, to minimize the cost of cube satellites and increase their modularity. M-PACE will be designed and built at the NASA Ames' SpaceShop, which is a state-of-the-art advanced manufacturing facility built for NASA researchers to formulate ideas for projects. The final products of M-PACE are several completed side panels of a one-unit (1U) (10 cm cube) cube satellite prototype built using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components, which will show the basic functionality of the internal payload by connecting it to the side panels for power and other subsystem capabilities. Within the structure, we are investigating the use of Digital Materials, which are universal building materials with the ability to increase precision and ease of assembly and disassembly of three dimensional (3D) objects. M-PACE will use COTS power systems and open-source hardware and software to distribute data through Ethernet through the use of snap-fit card connectors. Similar to Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) Express cards, we envision the spacecraft subsystems and payloads to be on a PC104-like board that will slide into the side panel connectors to enable distribution of power and data. This design has the potential to greatly reduce the cost of Cube Satellite testing and integration due to the absence of wires and ease of access to internal boards for any necessary modifications.

abstract={Bearing is one of vital transmission elements, finding numerous applications in small, medium and large machineries. Sound and vibration signals of a rotating machine contain the dynamic information about its operating condition. There are many articles in the literature reporting suitability of vibration signals for fault diagnosis applications; however, the transducer used for vibration signals (accelerometers) is costly. This prevents small scale industries and low cost equipments from using diagnostic tools on affordability ground. On the other hand, transducers used for acquiring sound signals are relatively low cost or/and affordable. Hence, there is a need for studying the use of sound signal for fault diagnosis applications. This paper uses acoustic signals (sound) acquired from near field area of bearings in good and simulated faulty conditions for the purpose of fault diagnosis through machine learning approach. The descriptive statistical features were extracted from sound signals and the important ones were selected using decision tree (dimensionality reduction). The selected features were then used for classification using C4.5 decision tree algorithm. The paper also discusses the effect of features, effect of various classifier parameters on classification accuracy. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The recent development of open-source 3-D printers makes scaling of distributed additive-based manufacturing of high-value objects technically feasible and offers the potential for widespread proliferation of mechatronics education and participation. These self-replicating rapid prototypers (RepRaps) can manufacture approximately half of their own parts from sequential fused deposition of polymer feedstocks. RepRaps have been demonstrated for conventional prototyping and engineering, customizing scientific equipment, and appropriate technology-related manufacturing for sustainable development. However, in order for this technology to proliferate like 2-D electronic printers have, it must be economically viable for a typical household. This study reports on the life-cycle economic analysis (LCEA) of RepRap technology for an average US household. A new low-cost RepRap is described and the costs of materials and time to construct it are quantified. The economic costs of a selection of 20 open-source printable designs (representing less than 0.02% of those available), are typical of products that a household might purchase, are quantified for print time, energy, and filament consumption and compared to low and high Internet market prices for similar products without shipping costs. The results show that even making the extremely conservative assumption that the household would only use the printer to make the selected 20 products a year the avoided purchase cost savings would range from about $300 to $2000/year. Assuming the 25 h of necessary printing for the selected products is evenly distributed throughout the year these savings provide a simple payback time for the RepRap in 4 months to 2 years and provide an ROI between >200% and >40%. As both upgrades and the components that are most likely to wear out in the RepRap can be printed and thus the lifetime of the distributing manufacturing can be substantially increased the unavoidable conclusion from this study is that the RepRap is an economically attractive investment for the average US household already. It appears clear that as RepRaps improve in reliability, continue to decline in cost and both the number and assumed utility of open-source designs continues growing exponentially, open-source 3-D printers will become a mass-market mechatronic device. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Small satellite missions face two special challenges due to limited financial budgets. The first is tracking the satellite for orbit determination after orbit injection. The orbit can vary from the specified orbit when the satellite will be launched as secondary or parasitic payload. In case of unknown orbit parameters high-gain antennas can't be pointed towards the satellite and establish the first connection needed for satellite activation. The second challenge is to transmit all housekeeping and scientific data to mission operations via a limited number of ground-stations. The Distributed Ground Station Network (DGSN) solution can solve the problem with permanent tracking and a faster orbital element provision to the satellite owners. And it can provide permanent reception of satellite signals with its data-dump mode in between main ground-stations provided by the satellite owner. The key feature is the network of small ground-stations placed globally connected via the internet and performing an automatic scan of satellite (and other beacon) signals, storing and sending them back to a central server, where they can be accessed by the satellite owner. With a correlation of the beacon signal and GNSS synched ground-station time the satellite position is determined with pseudo-ranging trilateration. In contrast to ground-station time sharing concepts of Radio Aurora Explorer (SRI International in California and University of Michigan), AlSat (DLR) and QB50-GENSO (Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics) that rely on a limited number of amateur radio operators and expensive hardware with limited availability DGSN uses an innovative citizen science approach. The participatory aspect includes the deployment of ground-station hardware and acquisition of satellite signal data but also the open-source hardware. In this way a high number of built sensornodes can be achieved and it also creates a new market for selling ready ground-stations. The network owners an open-platform for every small satellite operator with a faster access to tracking data than the update period by NORAD or ESTRACK with less running costs. The low data-rate reception is compensated by the global and permanent coverage. DGSN will offer the orbital parameters of the received satellite signal under a free license. The feasibility study had been conducted as part of Azorean observing VERDE Sat during the Small Satellite Project at the Institute of Space Systems (IRS) of the University of Stuttgart and DGSN is in the prototyping and testing phase of the ground-stations. ©2013 by the International Astronautical Federation.

A specific design allows simple device connection in daisy-chain configuration, thus removing addressing problems and allowing synchronized sampling design using just 4 wires. Several limitations are considered to provide mathematical model for estimation of maximum number of sensor nodes. An experimental setup was designed which demonstrated theoretical ability to acquire data from up to 200 sensors with 50 Hz sampling rate using conventional low-cost hardware, however, more advanced setup could allow to increase maximum number of sensors several times. The wiring structure of the network as well as hardware is specifically designed for use in smart garments or similar applications that require sensor integration in compact environment and low-power, real-time performance. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={There is a increasing interest in creating wearable smartphone interaction technologies. A novel smartphone wearable hybrid interaction framework based on mixed low-cost hardware and software is proposed in this work. The software application renders touch-less application graphics and status information using smart phone's screen. Augmented reality image rendering technology is employed for a convenient hand/foot and phone interaction. The users interact with the application using hand/foot gesture motion behind the camera, which trigger the interaction event and generate activity sequences for interactive buffers. The touch-less algorithm provides a core support for hand/foot-gesture interaction by accurately detecting and tracking the hand/foot gesture. Four proof-of-concept application prototypes are developed based on the wearable hybrid framework. The user study evaluation demonstrates the social acceptability of the designed hand/foot gestures and the usability of the applications on proposed wearable hybrid framework with touch-less interaction approach. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={In this study temperature profiling was used as a mapping tool to investigate surface watergroundwater interactions associated with low-permeability faults in the south-eastern part of the Netherlands. Data obtained from temperature profiling were simulated using a simple water and energy balance model. The model was used to quantify groundwater seepage rates near the faults. The model simulated the surface water temperature transects very well, but the model-based seepage rates are much higher than those reported in the literature for comparable hydrological settings. Of all the assumptions made in the model, the adopted values for the parameters that control the heat exchange between the water and the atmosphere are believed to be the most uncertain. Despite these uncertainties, temperature profiling proved to be a very useful tool to investigate surface water-groundwater interactions and to map groundwater seepage zones. The strength of using temperature as a tracer is that it is measured directly in the field with relative ease and using low cost equipment. © 2013 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

The process of building this interactive system consists of the following steps: Source data are taken from images acquired by abdominal computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Each selected abdominal organ (liver, kidney and spleen) is segmented by a semi-automatic process, from which a polygonal mesh is obtained to represent the 3D shape of the organ. Then the visual and mechanical properties of tissues, extracted from the recent literature, are associated to the polygonal representation with H3DAPI. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.},

After introducing common touchscreen usability problems, we presented our proposal aimed at enriching the user interface with haptic points to aid blind user orientation on the main sections of a user interface.

The aim of this deployment is to demonstrate that low cost wireless sensor networks can be used in situations where a full building management system may not be suitable technically or commercially either in residential home applications or commercial enterprises. This work focuses not just on electricity consumption but also on gas consumption into the building. The current deployment consists of a number of wireless sensor motes retrofitted throughout a residential building converted for office use. The WSN nodes are based on the Tyndall modular mote platform running the Contiki operating system and communicating with a mesh network running IPV6 through 6LoWPAN over IEEE 802.15.4 at 2.4GHz. Each node is configured for a specific task within the framework of enabling energy efficiency and these tasks can be broadly described as, environmental sensing, metering (gas and electricity) and actuation. The motes are controlled through the LinkSmart middleware platform which is an open source hardware agnostic system for building energy management, which hides the underlying physical layer allowing ease of development for web based applications, which is also demonstrated as part of this work.},

abstract={In this contribution, a control strategy in phase coordinates abc is proposed as the reference current generator to be used by the shunt active power filter (APF) compensation device. The development of the proposed reference current generator is described in detail. Its control design is kept simple, and transformation between different frameworks is not needed, thus allowing the control strategy to be applicable for both three-phase and single-phase electric systems maintaining theoretical and practical advantages. The proposed control strategy for the reference current generator is tested using Matlab/Simulink® with the incorporation of the Real-Time Workshop® for the simulation of the shunt APF compensation in real time. Based on the reported real-time application, it is possible to obtain simulation conditions that are close to the true real-time environment under study using only a single computer, giving accurate results with relatively low-cost hardware and providing a more complete evaluation of the applied control strategy. The dynamic behavior and performance of the shunt APF, using the proposed reference current calculator, have shown remarkable results. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

The user can select from a pool of more than 6000 Scilab examples and run it directly from the browser, thus making installation of Scilab natively unessential. Scilab on Cloud is offered as a Web 2.0 service with a public application programming interface(API) which can be used freely to execute codes on the cloud as a SaaS(Software as a Service).

abstract={The integration of nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into microsystems is highly desirable, in order to make use of the unique nanomaterial properties in real devices. However, the CNT-to-microsystem integration is challenging to implement in a manufacturable, cost-effective industrial process. This paper presents our work towards a process for making complete, integrated CMOS / MEMS systems with integrated CNT. We demonstrate the feasibility of the process, using room-temperature processing, low-cost equipment and consumables, and electrical control with automation possibilities. CNTs are directly integrated at the desired positions in the Si microsystem, forming closed Si / CNT / Si circuits. We explore different designs with the aim to obtain uniform and well-defined CNT synthesis conditions, and show that simplified designs can perform comparably to more complex ones. The Si / CNT / Si circuits obtained can show rectifying (Schottky-like) or near-ohmic behavior. Gas sensing possibilities are demonstrated, indicating the possibility of monitoring aging/ fermenting of food. Functionalization of CNTs is demonstrated, using thermal evaporation of Sn and Pd, opening for selective and sensitive sensors for various gases and analytes. Detailed microscopic characterization of the obtained CNTs are presented. © 2013 Shanghai University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

This has resulted in increased awareness and interest among the engineering students to learn these systems. However, PV related laboratory courses have ceased to exist due to the cost of PV panels and the relevant equipment required as well as the complexity involved in handling and testing of such systems mainly due to the dependence on the external weather conditions. This work proposes low cost and low power equipment for hands on experimentation of concepts like VI curves, Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT), partial shading, interconnection schemes to enhance the power generation in a PV array etc., in a laboratory at an undergraduate level. The experimental setup along with the procedure for performing the experiments in a compendious manner has been explained for various real life problems in PV generation systems.

abstract={Sound mixing is a well-established task applied (directly or indirectly) in many fields of music and sound production. For example, in the case of classical music orchestras, their conductors perform sound mixing by specifying the repro- duction gain of specific groups of musical instruments or of the entire orchestra. Moreover, modern sound artists and performers also employ sound mixing when they com- pose music or improvise in real-time. In this work a system is presented that incorporates a gestural interface for real- time multitrack sound mixing. The proposed gestural sound mixing control scheme is implemented on an open hardware micro-controller board, using common sensor modules. The gestures employed are as close as possible to the ones partic- ularly used by the orchestra conductors. The system overall performance is also evaluated in terms of the achieved user experience through subjective tests. Copyright © 2013 ACM.},

abstract={Human Computer Interaction (HCI) is one of the major disciplines in the field of computing which defines the way people interact with machines. HCI is a combination of computer vi science, behavioral science, design and several other areas which determines the best and optimized ways to interact with computers. The way people interact with machines changed dramatically after the 21st century due to the advancements of the computing devices. Computers became more portable and embedded to the environment with the improvement of processing power and miniaturization of devices. New concepts such as ubiquitous computing are also emerged with these advancements of technology. Traditional HCI concepts were failed to meet the requirements of the emerging technologies since most of these new concepts requires natural interactions rather using tangible devices. This paper present a computer vision based interactive surface application for human computer interaction which enable users to perform QWERTY keyboard and mouse interactions on a flat surface. Primarily, this research addresses the existing issues related to gesture based interactive interfaces by presenting a novel approach to perform interactions without stereoscopic vision and wearable markers. The proposing approach present a system (V-Touch) based on Haar-like features with single camera and a laser projection module that allows users to perform traditional keyboard and mouse interactions naturally using low cost hardware setup. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The 4G of mobile networks will be a technology-opportunistic and user-centric system, combining the economical and technological advantages of various transmission technologies. As a part of its new architecture, LTE networks will implement an evolved packet core. Although this will provide various critical advantages, it will, on the other hand, expose telecom networks to serious IP-based attacks. One often adopted solution to mitigate such attacks is based on a centralized security architecture. However, this approach requires large processing and memory resources to handle huge amounts of traffic, which, in turn, causes a significant over dimensioning problem in the centralized nodes. Hence, it may cause this approach to fail from achieving its security task. In this paper, we focus on a SPAM flooding attack, namely SMTP SPAM, and demonstrate, through simulations and discussion, its DoS impact on the Long Term Evolution (LTE) network and subsequent effects on the mobile network operator. Our main contribution involves proposing a distributed architecture on the LTE network that is secure and that mitigates attacks efficiently by solving the over dimensioning problem. It is also cost-effective by utilizing 'off-the-shelf' low-cost hardware in the distributed nodes. Through additional simulation and analysis, we demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Although motion correction in medical imaging is well established and has attracted much interest and research funding, a gap still exists in that there is a lack of reliable, low-cost hardware to enable such techniques to be widely adopted in healthcare. For PET, motion during scanning causes image blur which degrades image quality and quantifiability. In most marker based motion tracking systems used for brain imaging, a single tracking tool is fixed to the subject, however it is crucially important to ensure that the tool is rigidly fixed to the subject's head otherwise the tool may slip and the tracking data becomes unreliable. A tracking system has been developed using open source code and a single low cost digital camera that tracks multiple, small (≤10 mm 2) target markers printed onto adhesive paper which are attached to the subject's forehead. The system can track the 6 degree of freedom motion of the head to sub mm precision and in real-time while being robust against facial deformations that may move the target markers non-rigidly. In this study a standard, consumer grade, visible light webcam was used with a resolution of 1600×1200, operated at 30 Hz, and achieved simultaneous tracking of multiple markers with 0.2 mm and 0.3° mean error. Calibration to PET space was performed using simultaneous tracking of a 18F point source doped marker with mean positional error of 0.7 mm. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Second-Order Extended Kalman Filter (EKF2) is an elaboration of Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) that takes the nonlinearity of the measurements models into consideration and performances better than EKF in accuracy and filtering, but the computational complexity of EKF2 is larger than EKF In this paper, a low-complexity second-order extended Kalman filter algorithm (LEKF2) is proposed for GPS positioning having the same performance with EKF2 and almost the same complexity with EKF The second-order Taylor expansions of measurements are used to derive the algorithm process according the Kalman theory, and then modifying the algorithm process, especially the Kalman Gain matrix and the error covariance matrix, to meet the requirements of stability and computational burden The computation analyses show that the computations of LEKF2 are greatly reduced, e g a reduction of up to about 60% for EKF2 positioning algorithm, which is the same as EKF The static and dynamic simulations of LEKF2, EKF and EKF2 show that they have similar performance and the second-order algorithms are better than first-order algorithm in filtering Long time static testing under multipath improve LEKF2 stability and accuracy, meanwhile, dynamic tests under weak signal and multipath show that LEKF2 also does well at filtering Hence, the proposed algorithm LEKF2 offers potential for low-cost hardware implementation for hybrid positioning and other applications and is greatly light on positioning computational load with a good performance.},

abstract={This article focuses on the localization and navigation of a mobile differential robot in an indoor office-like environment. These are fundamental issues to service robotics, which is a branch with a strong market growth. The work implements a vision tracking system, environment mapping, route planning and navigation for an autonomous robot application inside services buildings. One goal of the methodology is its application with low cost equipment. The test bed chosen was a Pioneer P3-DX robot [16] in a service building, with an attached USB webcam, pointed at the ceiling to take advantage of the position of the light fixtures as natural landmarks. The robot location is estimated through two distinct probabilistic methods: a particle filter, when there is no information about the starting location of the robot, and the Kalman filter, given the convergence of the particle filter. Both methods use the detection of light fixtures together with the robot kinematics as information to estimate the pose. The mapping of the environment and its obstacles is obtained from the localization estimates and the information gathered by ultrasound sensors, representing the entire navigation space discretized in the form of an occupation grid. Planning the navigation path is determined by a simple search algorithm, namely the Wavefront algorithm, based on the information contained in the occupancy grid. For a given path, navigation is performed with obstacle avoidance using the virtual forces method. Replanning is used to recover from local minima situations. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Postnational, or after or more than national, is a world that connects the international with the local. Technollaboration, is how creative digital communities use technology to improve methods and environments for collaboration. Postbiotanical, after or more than biotanical, represents the future of human-centric collectives around farming and urban living and sustainability. Village, is ambiguous and raises the question how large is local, and how does a village-centric view impact the way we treat each other? Art traditionally functions as an environment for philosophical and creative activity that works to secure its borders from intruding dictatorial ethics, ideology, politics or dogma that might sully its aim to maintain its open arduous exploration of the clash between image and meaning, icon and significance, or perception and identity in reference to culture and history. Integrating technology into this discourse introduces a milieu of associations, expectations and conclusions about how technological innovation, practices and products should be steered, which can also influence what we both make and teach. The web has since evolved into a pervasively instantaneous space for more involved forms of communication (Google hangout), content sharing (SVN), publishing (blogs), community building (messageboards, Facebook), creative performance (Isadora) and more. Now creative interactive initiatives are not limited to merely making a statement or triggering a semiotic synapse, but rather can have a social impact, enacting, mobilizing and serving as a resource for the public. Telematic Art that includes the activities surrounding Digital Communities and their behaviour, does not merely provide an environment to discuss social issues, but embodies social interaction in ways in which new forms of collective expression can be realized. The development of telematics tools is empowering for the public while serving as a medium that influences how individuals interact. Between DIY/DIWO models, open source hardware, software, and creation initiatives, practivist initiatives, creative hacking ideologies, immersion, and web-based communication tools to localize the international collaborative workshop, I believe our formats for education and exchange are becoming more collective and empowering, and with the inclusion of digital social collaboration initiatives seen in myriad examples of Telematic Art, there exists the potential to motivate a mindset desiring new shifts in perception and making with the goals of serving the global community in significant and direct ways.},

abstract={Traditional manned airborne surveys are usually expensive and the resolution of the acquired images is often limited. The main advantage of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) system acting as a photogrammetric sensor platform over more traditional manned airborne system is the high flexibility that allows image acquisition from unconventional viewpoints, the low cost in comparison with classical aerial photogrammetry and the high resolution images obtained. Nowadays there is a necessity for surveying small areas and in these cases, it is not economical the use of normal large format aerial or metric cameras to acquire aerial photos, therefore, the use of UAV platforms can be very suitable. Also the large availability of digital cameras has strongly enhanced the capabilities of UAVs. The use of digital non metric cameras together with the UAV could be used for multiple applications such as aerial surveys, GIS, wildfire mapping, stability of landslides, crop monitoring, etc. The aim of this work was to develop a low cost and accurate methodology in the production of orthophotos and Digital Elevation Models (DEM). The study was conducted in the province of Almeria, south of Spain. The photogrammetric flight had an altitude of 50 m over ground, covering an area of 5.000 m2 approximately. The UAV used in this work was the md4-200, which is an electronic battery powered quadrocopter UAV developed by Microdrones GmbH, Germany. It had on-board a Pextax Optio A40 digital non metric camera with 12 Megapixels. It features a 3x optical zoom lens with a focal range covering angles of view equivalent to those of 37-111 mm lens in 35 mm format. The quadrocopter can be programmed to follow a route defined by several waypoints and actions and it has the ability for vertical take off and landing. Proper flight geometry during image acquisition is essential in order to minimize the number of photographs, avoid areas without a good coverage and make the overlaps homogeneous. The flight planning was done using the MdCockpit software, with the module waypoint editor. Flight route file was downloaded into the quadrocopter autonomous chip via cable. A total of twelve vertical images with a longitudinal and transversal overlapping of 60 % and 50 % respectively were taken. The digital camera was previously geometrically calibrated. Field control points covering the whole studied area were defined over the area of interest and their coordinates were measured by a GPS. Natural targets were used as field control points. The close range photogrammetric software Photomodeler Scanner v.7 was used in this work to calibrate the camera and to carry out the photogrammetric process. The software Golden Surfer was used to produce the DEM. The planimetric and the altimetric root mean square error (RMSE) were calculated in order to check the accuracy of the products. The RMSEx was 6 cm, the RMSEy was 4 cm and the RMSEy was 7 cm. Our preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of orthophotos and DEMs obtained from images captured from a quadrocopter using low cost photogrammetric software. A future work can be the comparison of the products obtained following the route used in this study where the images are taken vertically with the products obtained with an orbital route where the number of images will be diminished and the photos will be taken oblique.},

abstract={3D reconstruction has been already one of the most interesting research areas among photogrammetry and computer vision researchers. This thesis aims to evaluate digital fringe projection method in reconstruction of small objects with complicated shape. Digital fringe projection method is a novel method in structured light technique which integrates interferometric and triangulation methods. In this method, a digital projector projects a series of sinusoidal fringe patterns onto the object surface. Then, a camera from a different point of view captures images of patterns that are deformed due to object's surface topography. Afterward, the captured images will be processed and the depth related phase would be calculated. Due to using arctangent function in the process of phase extraction, the computed phase ranges from -pi to +pi, so a phase unwrapping step is necessary. Finally, the unwrapped phase map would be converted to depth map with some mathematical models. This method has many advantages like high speed, high accuracy, low cost hardware, high resolution (each pixel will have a depth at end), and simple computations. This paper aims to evaluate different parameters which affect the accuracy of the final results. For this purpose, some test were designed and implemented. These tests assess the number of phase shifts, spatial frequency of the fringe pattern, light condition, noise level of images, and the color and material of target objects on the quality of resulted phase map. The evaluation results demonstrate that digital fringe projection method is capable of obtaining depth map of complicated object with high accuracy. The contrast test results showed that this method is able to work under different ambient light condition; although at places with high light condition will not work properly. The results of implementation on different objects with various materials, color and shapes demonstrate the high capability of this method of 3D reconstruction.},

abstract={We present the software-defined radio (SDR) implementation of a Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) Listener, a passive receive-only device that decodes the signals exchanged between the RFID Reader and the interrogated Tag following the Electronic Product Code Class-1 Generation-2 standard. Our RFID Listener is based on the open-source project GNU Radio. It provides complete flexibility and full control over the entire protocol stack down to the physical layer. As such, it can be used as a powerful but inexpensive tool for testing and measuring the performance of RFID systems in real operating conditions. In this paper, we leverage the SDR Listener for a number of experiments that, taken collectively, are illustrative of the potential of such tool for RFID research. First, we use it to test comparatively different timing recovery schemes for the reception of the Tag signal in uplink, through the analysis of bit-error statistics measured experimentally. We find that the scheme proposed by Harris and Rice based on polyphase filter bank displays excellent performance in this context, very close to the theoretical bound and with a gain of 5 dB over the more common Mueller and Muller scheme. Second, we use the Listener to evaluate the impact of frequency nulls in the uplink RFID channel for different indoor scenarios. We find that frequency nulls are pronounced particularly in the presence of metal objects and obstructions of the Fresnel zone, but frequency hopping is effective in counteracting the problem. Our experiments show that the signal backscattered by a passive Tag can be correctly received up to a distance of 35 m, with low-cost equipment and without highly directional antennas. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Background Point-of-care ultrasound (POC-US) use is increasingly common as equipment costs decrease and availability increases. Despite the utility of POC-US in trained hands, there are many situations wherein patients could benefit from the added safety of POC-US guidance, yet trained users are unavailable. We therefore hypothesized that currently available and economic 'off-the-shelf' technologies could facilitate remote mentoring of a nurse practitioner (NP) to assess for recurrent pneumothoraces (PTXs) after chest tube removal. Methods The simple remote telementored ultrasound system consisted of a handheld ultrasound machine, head-mounted video camera, microphone, and software on a laptop computer. The video output of the handheld ultrasound machine and a macroscopic view of the NP's hands were displayed to a remote trauma surgeon mentor. The mentor instructed the NP on probe position and US machine settings and provided real-time guidance and image interpretation via encrypted video conferencing software using an Internet service provider. Thirteen pleural exams after chest tube removal were conducted. Results Thirteen patients (26 lung fields) were examined. The remote exam was possible in all cases with good connectivity including one trans-Atlantic interpretation. Compared to the subsequent upright chest radiograph, there were 4 true-positive remotely diagnosed PTXs, 2 false-negative diagnoses, and 20 true-negative diagnoses for 66% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and 92% accuracy for remotely guided chest examination. Conclusions Remotely guiding a NP to perform thoracic ultrasound examinations after tube thoracostomy removal can be simply and effectively performed over encrypted commercial software using low-cost hardware. As informatics constantly improves, mentored remote examinations may further empower clinical care providers in austere settings. © 2013 Biegler et al.},

abstract={Notwithstanding laser scanning technology is a mature technology used in widening application fields, a variety of barriers hinds its integration in robotized production lines. To face well know problems, as high-costs and not customizable solutions among others, the authors have developed a new family of laser scanning devices based on off the shelves and low cost hardware components and on a modular design that allow the customization of the device according to the specific application requirements. High accuracy is guaranteed through a computationally efficient non-parametric calibration procedure. Keeping limited the overall cost of the solution provided while increasing in general the sensing capabilities of an Industrial Robot (IR) and in particular the autonomous recognition of position, orientation and furthermore shape and geometrical features of objects within the robotic workspace, can boost the penetration of IRs in typical traditional industrial sectors where SMEs productive scenario is mainly characterized by manual fabrication processes, high product variability, small batches and little capital investments. High added value footwear industry is a paradigmatic example where hard automation is limited from one side by high variability of products and huge request of autonomous adaptation to cope with different loosely structured fabrication processes and from the other side by a low propensity towards high capital investment that make difficult the penetration of industrial robots. Within the framework of the European Project ROBOFOOT (EU-FP7-SMP), authors have conceived and developed a new family of low cost modular and reconfigurable laser scanners and successfully applied in the footwear fabrication scenario. Various operations should be improved by actual measure of the shoe being manufactured, and among the others, the identification of the relative positioning between the last (the plastic element on top of which is built the shoe) and the gripping device is extremely critical because it is still performed manually. Positioning errors in this phase are critical since all robot part-programs depend on the correct alignment of the last with the robot end-effector. To face this problem, a procedure, based on the Iterative Closest Points (ICP) optimization method, has been developed and integrated on board of the laser scanning device that directly communicates with the robot controller to adapt and autonomously correct the part-program to align the tool nominal path with the actual shoe being manufactured. Efficacy of the proposed methods has been proved by measuring the interaction forces between the tool and the last handled by a robot during different technological operations (roughing, polishing etc) typical of the shoe fabrication cycle.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) became popular platforms for the collection of remotely sensed geodata in the last years (Hardin & Jensen 2011). Various applications in numerous fields of research like archaeology (Hendrickx et al., 2011), forestry or geomorphology evolved (Martinsanz, 2012). This contribution deals with the generation of multi-temporal crop surface models (CSMs) with very high resolution by means of low-cost equipment. The concept of the generation of multi-temporal CSMs using Terrestrial Laserscanning (TLS) has already been introduced by Hoffmeister et al. (2010). For this study, data acquisition was performed with a low-cost and low-weight Mini-UAV (< 5kg). UAVs in general and especially smaller ones, like the system presented here, close a gap in small scale remote sensing (Berni et al., 2009; Watts et al., 2012). In precision agriculture frequent remote sensing on such scales during the vegetation period provides important spatial information on the crop status. Crop growth variability can be detected by comparison of the CSMs in different phenological stages. Here, the focus is on the detection of this variability and its dependency on cultivar and plant treatment. The method has been tested for data acquired on a barley experiment field in Germany. In this contribution, it is applied to a different crop in a different environment. The study area is an experiment field for rice in Northeast China (Sanjiang Plain). Three replications of the cultivars Kongyu131 and Longjing21 were planted in plots that were treated with different amounts of N-fertilizer. In July 2012 three UAV-campaigns were carried out. Establishment of ground control points (GCPs) allowed for ground truth. Additionally, further destructive and non-destructive field data were collected. The UAV-system is an MK-Okto by Hisystems (www.mikrokopter.de) which was equipped with the high resolution Panasonic Lumix GF3 12 megapixel consumer camera. The self-built and self-maintained system has a payload of up to 1 kg and an average flight time of 15 minutes. The maximum speed is around 30 km/h and the system can be operated up to a wind speed of less than 19 km/h (Beaufort scale number 3 for wind speed). Using a suitable flight plan stereo images can be captured. For this study, a flying height of 50 m and a 44% side and 90% forward overlap was chosen. The images are processed into CSMs under the use of the Structure from Motion (SfM)-based software Agisoft Photoscan 0.9.0. The resulting models have a resolution of 0.02 m and an average number of about 12 million points. Further data processing in Esri ArcGIS allows for quantitative comparison of the plant heights. The multi-temporal datasets are analysed on a plot size basis. The results can be compared to and combined with the additional field data. Detecting plant height with non-invasive measurement techniques enables analysis of its correlation to biomass and other crop parameters (Hansen & Schjoerring, 2003; Thenkabail et al., 2000) measured in the field. The method presented here can therefore be a valuable addition for the recognition of such correlations.},

abstract={In FISITA 2010 IPEK (Institute of Product Engineering) introduced the vehicle-in-the-loop platform based on its X-in-the-loop approach (F2010-C-177) (Albers and Düser, Implementation of a vehicle-in-the-loop development and validation platform, FISITA world automotive congress, Budapest, 2010). It offers a methodology for multi domain product development and validation as well focuses on its key hypothesis that validation is the main task in every step of product development process. An open hardware and software platform allows integration of different real components and simulation models as well as the usage of established tools and methods for measurement and validation. The platform is based on a common hardware-in-the-loop System using extended I/O-communication to the vehicle and the test bench. The application is done in C code and Matlab/Simulink so an easy exchange of modular simulation models and test cases is feasible. The architecture of model-, component- and test case implementation simplifies the scalability as well as the modularization. IPEK uses this platform amongst others for its improved fully automated validation environment which allows the optimization of operating time for determination of shifting quality on the chassis dynamometer. The task is to perform several hundred gearshifts under particular reproducible conditions automatically such as engine speed or even battery state of charge, which normally a real driver had to perform on a real test track. Compared to road tests on the rig it is possible to reach time benefits of over 80% by using a special driver model for acceleration (using gas pedal), deceleration (using dynamometer) and gear shifting (using tip signal at steering wheel). Since the vehicle behaviour on the road is constrained to different environmental conditions it is necessary to reproduce these conditions on the test bench accurately. Different resistances affect the vehicles responses such as shifting strategy, acceleration characteristics or fuel consumption which results in altering test results. State of the art for simulating environmental conditions and vehicle characteristics on the chassis dynamometer is the Road-Load-Simulation (RLS) which uses measured vehicle coast downs to map the static resistances of a real car on a real track onto the test bench. These coast downs have to be redone every single time components of the car or the environment changes. In addition, changing resistances during test like air drag due to headwind and rolling drag due to tire temperature or abrasion can't be simulated based on that static coast down. This paper shows an approach for simulating all kind of resistances that can appear and vary during the test such as air drag (wind), road gradient, road friction, curve resistance etc. in real-time. It can be used to drive test cases like the determination of characteristic shifting map in a more realistic way to perform better validated results. Central point is a configurable vehicle and environment model which has to be parameterized with data from the real car and track and then calculates the necessary dynamometer responses. Applied with a four roller dynamometer (two or even four driven axles) it offers the possibility to perform complex all-wheel manoeuvres e.g. such as l-split or cornering with independent wheel behaviour and slip. Besides the advantages of this approach, an analysis of different influencing factors is shown in this paper. © Springer-Verlag 2013.},

abstract={In this paper we introduce a definition of post-Turing ICT with an initial analysis of its sustainability. At the beginning of the history of computing the attention was concentrated on the single machine: a device able to read and write a memory and able to execute different actions depending on the internal state. It was only in the 1960's that the fifth function (after input, memory, processing and output) was introduced: the network, the capability of this single computational node to be connected and exchange data with similar machines. In the last fifty years the network has grown at an incredible speed, introducing us into the post-Turing ICT era: billions of electronic devices interconnected. ICT has now a significant environmental impact along all its lifetime phases: manufacturing (based on scarce minerals), application (based on growing power consumption) and e-waste management (with open cycles difficult to close). In this paper, we introduce relevant topics to understand whether the current ICT production and consumption paradigms are sustainable, and the social consequences and implications of such a problem for stakeholders. © 2012 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract={Idleness has to be carefully exploited in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to save power and to accumulate the energy possibly harvested from the environment. State-of-the-art microcontroller units provide a wide range of ultra-low-power inactive modes with sub-millisecond wakeup time that can be effectively used for this purpose. At the same time they are equipped with 16-bit RISC architectures clocked at tens of MHz, which make them powerful enough to run a Java-compatible virtual machine (VM). This makes it possible to bring the benefits of a virtual runtime environment into power-constrained embedded systems. VMs, however, risk to impair the effectiveness of dynamic power management as they are seen as always-active processes by the scheduler of the operating system in spite of the idleness of the threads running on top of them. Avoiding to keep sensor nodes busy when they could be idle is mandatory for the energetic sustainability of WSNs. While most of the tasks of a sensor node are inherently event-driven, the functioning of its hardware-software components is not, so that they require to be redesigned in order to exploit idleness.

The presented wireless nodes should achieve a high miniaturization degree and use an onboard FMCW secondary radar for distance measurements. The challenge for designing the digital system was to reduce memory requirements towards a low cost hardware design in general, and for an ASIC design in particular. Reducing chip area implies lower energy consumption and helps saving implementation and production costs. At the same time a qualitative performance of the digital signal processing tasks while keeping the system constraints has to be assured. The introduced novel hardware implementation concept fulfill these criteria, and has been implemented and verified on a FPGA before starting the chip design. For the use case of a two-sweep-measurement-system the design has been realized as an ASIC using IBM 130nm CMOS technology. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={We describe a new, quadruped robot platform, Aracna, which requires non-intuitive motor commands in order to locomote and thus provides an interesting challenge for gait learning algorithms, such as those frequently developed in the Evolutionary Computation and Artificial Life communities. Aracna is an open-source hardware project composed of off-the-shelf and 3D-printed parts, enabling other research teams to modify its design according to their scientific needs. Aracna was designed to overcome the shortcomings of a previous quadruped robot platform, whose legs were so heavy that the motors could not reliably execute the commands sent to them. We avoid this problem by locating all motors in the body core instead of on the legs and through a design which enables the servos to have a greater mechanical advantage. Specifically, each of the four legs has two joints controlled by separate four-bar linkage mechanisms that drive the pitch of the hip joint and knee joint. This novel design causes unconventional kinematics, creating an opportunity for gaitlearning algorithms, which excel in counter-intuitive design spaces where human engineers tend to underperform. Because it is low-cost, flexible, kinematically interesting, and and improvement over a previous design, Aracna provides a useful new hardware platform for testing algorithms that automatically generate robotic behaviors. © 2012 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

The aim of this paper is show the development of the method to monitor the transesterification reaction 'in line of process' using the ultrasound technique. The materials used in this study were degummed soybean oil, methanol and ethanol and potassium hydroxide (KOH). Two catalytic routes were tested, both of them using soybean oil and KOH, as catalyser. The difference between them was the alcohol used (methanol and ethanol). The test was carried out in batch without heating, and with stirring. The results showed that the time of flight, as well as the echo amplitude, present different behaviours depending on the type of alcohol used. Although the study is still in progress, preliminary results suggest that the proposed method may be feasible to monitor the reactions of biodiesel during its fabrication, in real time and with relatively low cost equipment. © 2012 IEEE.},

Access points in the same network interfere with each other, degrading the aggregate performance of stations. Moreover, wireless networks usually coexist with others applications that share the same spectrum and negatively impact the packet transmission. To overcome these issues, we propose the channel allocation algorithm designed for central controllers of infra-structured IEEE 802.11 networks. Our algorithm reduces the interference in controlled access points through the dynamic choice of their operating channels and, unlike other proposals, was designed to operate in a network composed of low cost devices from different brands, and open source software. Furthermore, we also consider the interference caused by unmanaged networks, adjusting the settings of the managed access points according to the wireless environment. The proposal was implemented and evaluated in an open testbed, and the results show that our controller efficiently manages the spectrum with low cost equipment and a low complexity algorithm. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Fiber-fed multi-object spectrographs have greatly enhanced the spectroscopic capabilities of the world's premiere telescopes, but their exibility has typically been limited by a fixed effective slit size that constrains the available resolving power. We present a novel mechanism that, for the first time, equips a fiber-fed spectrograph with multiple discreet slits of different widths. In this paper, we detail the mechanical design of our variable slit mechanism, which is capable of positioning any one of six slits in front of the fibers immediately prior to injection into the spectrograph's optical train. Further, we present the details of related systems necessary to achieve closed loop positioning of the slit mechanism given that no encoder is used. We also briey discuss our use of open source and open hardware projects in the design. Finally, we describe the control system we have implemented for this subsystem. © 2012 SPIE.},

abstract={Biofeedback is a technique that teaches a user to control physiological signals by using mental processes. It has been used to treat mental and physical disorders such as stress, anxiety, diabetes, hypertension, headache, Raynaud's syndrome and other health problems. Biofeedback has conventionally been used at the office of the therapist. Mobile biofeedback may improve the outcomes as there would not be restrictions of place and time. The acquisition board is based on the open hardware Arduino and communicated by Bluetooth to the cellular phone which was programmed to implement thermal and electrodermal response (EDR) biofeedback. Five participants were part of this study, they were able to increase the temperature of the index finger and increase EDR levels using the equipment. Both techniques of biofeedback showed to decrease anxiety and stress greater than doing a relaxing activity. Stress levels were assessed by State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) questionnaire used to record stress and anxiety traits. This study suggests that biofeedback might be implemented on mobile devices as a therapeutic tool for stress and anxiety. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The space industry is entering a new age, driven by low-cost hardware and software solutions. These modern solutions are driven by practical considerations, focusing on integrating and adapting "off-the-shelf" products in place of specialised solutions. To address this need, for both new and experienced space industry software teams, the authors present Hummingbird, an open source monitoring and control framework. By reusing and integrating existing software components, the Hummingbird software packages provide a ground segment for small satellites. As a consequence of heavy reuse of open source software, we have shown that implementation effort and cost can be reduced significantly whilst stability and quality increase. As an open source project, Hummingbird encourages contributions from users in the field, and is available free of charge to interested parties. Hummingbird is licensed under an open source license, making it an ideal starting point for small commercial or university teams. ©2012 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

abstract={The cost of building high data rate (≈100 Mb/s per user) wireless internet access networks in rural areas can be significantly reduced by minimizing the number of access points to be deployed, each covering a larger area with a larger user capacity. Given that the available spectrum is limited even in rural areas especially at a lower frequency (VHF and UHF), which typically has an advantage of efficiently covering a larger area, the spectral efficiency of the access system needs to be improved many times over that currently feasible by commercially available technologies. We have developed a new technology suitable for wireless internet access in rural areas that achieved a spectral efficiency of 67 bits/s/Hz, which is believed to be the highest reported in the literature, on a practical low-cost hardware.

abstract={During code review tasks, comparing two versions of a hardware design description using existing program differencing tools such as diff is inherently limited because these tools implicitly assume sequential execution semantics, while hardware description languages are designed to model concurrent computation. We designed a position-independent differencing algorithm to robustly handle language constructs whose relative orderings do not matter. This paper presents Vdiff, an instantiation of this position-independent differencing algorithm for Verilog HDL. To help programmers reason about the differences at a high-level, Vdiff outputs syntactic differences in terms of Verilog-specific change types. The quantitative evaluation of Vdiff on two open source hardware design projects shows that Vdiff is very accurate, with overall 96.8 % precision and 97.3 % recall when using manually classified differences as a basis of comparison. Vdiff is also fast and scalable-it processes the entire revision history of nine open projects all under 5.35 minutes. We conducted a user study with eight hardware design experts to understand how the program differences identified by the experts match Vdiff's output. The study results show that Vdiff's output is better aligned with the experts' classification of Verilog changes than an existing textual program differencing tool. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

This system avoids the need of an expensive Frequency Response Analyzer (FRA). The transceiver amplitude frequency response gives a correction parameter using any transceiver configuration in order to acquire any external electrical circuit amplitude frequency response, acoustic signature of a room, failure detection on transformers coils, etc. The frequency range depends on the transmitter and receiver boards used.

abstract={Radio interference or deliberate jamming attacks can cause highly unpredictable communication in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Most prevalent WSN platforms consist of low-cost hardware with no effective measures against these threats. Most proposed countermeasures require a more advanced hardware design or radical changes to the 802.15.4 MAC protocol. These alternatives can be very difficult or even impossible to apply to existing WSN designs. In this paper we do not attempt to change the hardware or the MAC protocol. Instead we investigate how WSN routing protocols behave when the network is affected by interference. The paper proposes enhancements of CTP, the de-facto tree-based routing protocol for WSN, using opportunistic routing. We compare our approach with a wide range of protocols: CTP, TYMO, MultihopLQI, broadcast and geographic opportunistic routing in a real-life TelosB testbed subjected to different interference levels. The results show that our hybrid protocol, O-CTP, both improves the data delivery rate and reduces the cost when compared to standard routing protocols. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={One of the most demanding challenges in the field of audio engineering is the transmission of low-latency high quality audio streams over networks. While several protocols nowadays allow wired local network streaming, much effort is still required to achieve similar goals over existing wireless LAN technologies. While the challenge is still far from being solved, several design issues can be highlighted and future scenarios can be outlined. This paper proposes the setup of a wireless music production system based on open hardware and open software which requires relatively low setup effort while allowing for a high flexibility of use. The hardware platform is the Beagleboard, based on Texas Instruments DM3730, running a GNU/Linux OS and the computer music language Pure Data. Such a device can capture electric instrument audio, generate sound, send MIDI or OSC control data, and stream to PCs and other embedded devices operating as mixers, effect racks and so on, enabling an ecosystem of flexible and open devices. Tests conducted on a home wireless network show acceptable latency for many applications. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Laboratory activities of analog electronic circuit undergraduate course at École de technologie supérieure (ETS) require the physical presence of students in groups of 2 in the laboratory to complete predefined or project based laboratories. This classical or traditional approach continuously requires big investments on laboratory equipment and significant space requirements. Moreover, it obliges students to be physically present in the laboratory to complete their experiments. The lab instructor is also present to help them with their needs or to answer their specific questions related to the experiments. With the evolution of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and electronic circuit board technologies, further possibilities even include to bring the laboratory at home (Lab@home). This philosophy can be achieved with the advantages of miniaturized and low cost equipment and facilities, complemented with the student's already available personal computers. Available miniature kits include basic electronics for the generation and processing of various types of signals. The personal computer coupled with the kit, acts as a set of signal injecting and measuring devices. Pedagogical strategies to encourage team collaborative work, ensuring simultaneous information exchanges between the students themselves and with the laboratory instructor can be elaborated specifically for this innovative setup. This recent approach can be used to help enforce the knowledge and competence of the students, allowing them to develop their autonomy, their creativity and thus develop their ability to innovate. This paper presents and further details the Lab@home approach, with its impacts on the students, the Professor, the lab instructor and on the academic institution more globally. The necessary resources, common challenges and difficulties, advantages and drawbacks of the approach, and recommendations for its implementation are also included. A Lab@home implementation case study is also presented at the end of this paper. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Molecular combing is an established technique for aligning DNA nanowires on a surface. When performed on micro-patterned surfaces, this technique can be used to reliably align and stretch DNA nanowires across micro pillars. Imprinting of these aligned DNA nanowires is an affordable technique for fabrication of arrays of nano-scale channels across micro-scale reservoirs. In the past, DNA combing and imprinting (DCI) have been performed manually to fabricate polymer chips that are used in biomedical applications such as gene therapy and drug delivery studies. Automation of the DCI process is necessary to improve the yield and to scale-up production for these applications. However, existing automated techniques are not appropriate for DNA nano wire imprinting because these techniques cannot handle (i) fragile stamps and (ii) individual chip scale stamps of size ∼1 cm2. Herein, we present the design, fabrication and performance evaluation of an imprinting stage that enables (i) handling fragile stamps via low-cost equipment and (ii) production scale-up via simultaneous handling of multiple stamps. The stage is based on a self-aligning imprinting technique that passively aligns a stamp parallel to the substrate thereby enabling simultaneous imprinting of multiple stamps via a single stage. This self-alignment technique minimizes nano wire breakage by ensuring (i) minimal in-plane stamp motion during imprinting and (ii) that the contact forces do not exceed the weight of the stamp. Based on this technique we have designed/fabricated a stage that can simultaneously handle three stamps and is capable of further scale-up. The stage consists of a movable platform that is mounted on linear bearings and is actuated via a stepper motor. Stamps are loaded onto a holder that is mounted on the movable platform via kinematic couplings. This allows one to rapidly attach and detach the holder from the stage and also makes it possible to handle fragile stamps during loading/unloading. Imprinting of DNA nanowires with a manual stage has demonstrated the feasibility of the self-alignment scheme. Experiments that were performed to test the alignment capability of the stage verify that conformal stamp contact can be achieved across all three stamps even in the presence of an angular misalignment of 5obetween the stamp and the glass slide. This ability to simultaneously align multiple stamps is a critical step in being able to scale-up and fully automate the DCI process. Copyright © 2012 by ASME.},

abstract={Integrating terrestrial and satellite communications promises several advantages, whereas the most evident one is that modern satellite networks achieve global coverage using a multiple spot beam architecture. In order to increase the spectral efficiency, orthogonal waveforms like single-carrier frequency-division multiple access (SC-FDMA) are investigated recently. In this paper, we verify experimentally that SC-FDMA waveforms taken from the 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard can be transmitted reliably in the return channel over satellite using low-cost equipment. Mainly, we introduce an additional timing advance offset depending on satellite elevation and geographical location. And we ensure that precise information about the frequency offset measured in the forward channel is reused for compensation in the return channel at each terminal. We demonstrate in real-time transmission experiments over a geostationary Ku-band satellite that all modulation formats defined for the up-link in the LTE Release 8 standard can be decoded error-free. Using 16-QAM, we have realized a spectral efficiency of 3.2 bits/s/Hz. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The real-time monitoring of events in an industrial plant is vital, to monitor the actual conditions of operation of the machinery responsible for the manufacturing process. A predictive maintenance program includes condition monitoring of the rotating machinery, to anticipate possible conditions of failure. To increase the operational reliability it is thus necessary an efficient tool to analyze and monitor the equipments, in real-time, and enabling the detection of e.g. incipient faults in bearings. To fulfill these requirements some innovations have become frequent, namely the inclusion of vibration sensors or stator current sensors. These innovations enable the development of new design methodologies that take into account the ease of future modifications, upgrades, and replacement of the monitored machine, as well as expansion of the monitoring system. This paper presents the development, implementation and testing of an instrument for vibration monitoring, as a possible solution to embed in industrial environment. The digital control system is based on an FPGA, and its configuration with an open hardware design tool is described.

abstract={Accurate indirect jump prediction is critical for the performance and energy efficiency of modern high-performance processors. This paper proposes the Hybrid Value Correlation (HVC) based indirect jump prediction, which combines various types of correlated information to reduce indirect jump mispredictions. First of all, our mechanism relies on the compiler to identify the correlated data values based on high-level dataflow information. Second, our mechanism maintains two kinds of correlated information: the single data value and the value history. Our mechanism makes use of a low-cost hardware structure, which dynamically chooses the best correlated information for indirect jump prediction according to different processor states. Experimental results show that HVC prediction can significantly reduce the misprediction rate over the baseline-BTB prediction and the state-of-the-art VBBI prediction. The low misprediction rate of HVC prediction leads to better performance and lower power consumption over previous predictors.},

abstract={Acoustic sensing to gather information about a machine can be highly beneficial, but processing the data can be difficult. In this work, a variety of methodologies have been studied to extract rotor speed information from the sound signature of an autonomous helicopter, with no a-priori knowledge of its underlying acoustic properties. The autonomous helicopter has two main rotors that are mostly identical. In order to identify the rotors' speeds individually, a comparative evaluation has been made of learning methods with input selection, reduction and aggregation methods. The resulting estimators have been tested on unseen training data as well as in actual free-flight tests. The best results were found by using a genetic algorithm to identify the important frequency bands, a centroid method to aggregate the bands, and a neural-network estimator of the rotor speeds. This approach succeeded in estimating individual rotor speeds of an autonomous helicopter without being distracted by the other, mainly identical, rotor. These results were achieved using standard, low-cost hardware, and a learning approach that did not require any a-priori knowledge about the system's acoustic properties. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={We present a novel probabilistic framework for reliable indoor positioning of mobile sensor network devices. Compared to existing approaches, ours adopts complex computations in exchange for high localization accuracy while needing low hardware investment and moderate set-up cost. To that end, we use full distributional information on signal measurements at a set of discrete locations, termed landmarks. Positioning of a mobile device is done relative to the resulting landmark graph and the device can be found near a landmark or in the area between two landmarks. Key elements of our approach include profiling the signal measurement distributions over the coverage area using a special interpolation technique; a two-tier statistical positioning scheme that improves efficiency by adding movement detection; and joint clusterhead placement optimization for both localization and movement detection. The proposed system is practical and has been implemented using standard wireless sensor network hardware. Experimentally, our system achieved an accuracy equivalent to less than 5 meters with 95 percent success probability and less than 3 meters with an 87 percent success probability. This performance is superior to well-known contemporary systems that use similar low-cost hardware. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Indoor localization is an important part of integrated AAL solutions providing continuous services to elderly persons. They are able to fulfill multiple purposes, ranging from energy saving or location based reminders to burglary detection. Particularly useful are combined systems that include localization, as well as additional services e.g. fall detection. Capacitive sensing systems that allow detecting the presence of a body over distance are a possible solution for indoor localization that has been used in the past. However usually the installation requirements are high and consequently they are expensive to integrate. We propose a flexible, integrated solution based on affordable, open-source hardware that allows indoor localization and fall detection specifically designed for challenges in the context of AAL. The system is composed of sensing mats that can be placed under various types of floor covering that wirelessly transmit data to a central platform providing localization and fall detection services to connected AAL platforms. The system was evaluated noncompetitive in the 2011 EvAAL indoor localization competition. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={This work proposes Pointy, a software assisted hardware pointer prefetcher for Java applications. Pointy exploits the strengths of both software and hardware. Its runtime software component communicates points-to relationships between objects to the underlying hardware. This points-to information is maintained and tracked in any managed runtime that implements automatic garbage collection. Pointy stores the object connectivity information in a separate hardware structure and uses it to generate timely pointer prefetches. To achieve a low-cost hardware implementation, Pointy spills the object metadata to the conventional memory hierarchy and retrieves it only when needed. Taking advantage of its hybrid design, Pointy can selectively communicate points-to metadata to the hardware based on class profiling that is readily available at the runtime level, while impractical to extract at the hardware level. Experimental results show that Pointy improves performance for pointer intensive benchmarks even in the presence of conventional prefetchers. When used in conjunction with traditional prefetchers, such as striding and next line, Pointy improves application performance by 53% for SpecJBB 2005 and by 72% on average1, which represents a speedup of 19% and 18%, respectively, compared to traditional prefetchers.

The analysis techniques are required to compute bounds for the FlexRay frame response times, before the standard is used for safety and time-critical applications. In this paper, we introduce an Intelligent FlexRay Safety Monitoring Platform (IFSMP) on which safety monitoring applications can be developed.

abstract={The advances in computing power, availability of large- capacity storage devices and research in computer vision have contributed to recent developments in gait recognition. The ease of acquiring human videos by low cost equipments makes gait recognition much easier and less intrusive than other biometric systems. In this paper, a gait recognition system using a space-model-based approach is proposed. The proposed mechanism is able to detect moving object of interest, while track them and analyzing their gait for recognition. The system captures videos of subjects in front a stationary camera. The identification module makes use of the shape and dynamics of the system using HMM. Then it models the gait properties by accepting the feature vectors as input and model the dynamics through state transitions and observation probabilities. The experimental results show that the proposed gait recognition system successfully recognizes humans using their gait. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Extreme CMOS scaling is expected to significantly impact the reliability of future microprocessors, prompting recent research effort on low-cost hardware-software cross-layer reliability solutions. To evaluate, statistical fault injection (SFI) is often used to estimate the error coverage of the underlying method. Unfortunately, because a significant number of errors injected by SFI are often derated, the evaluation becomes less rigorous and less efficient. This paper makes the observation that many derated errors can be gracefully avoided to allow the fault injection campaign to focus on likely non-derated faults that stress the method-under-test. We propose a biased injection framework called CriticalFault that employs vulnerability analysis to map out relevant faults for stress testing. With CriticalFault, our results show that the injection space is reduced by 29% and 59% of the biased injections cause either software aborts or silent data corruptions, both are improvements from SFI. Moreover, we characterize different propagation behaviors of these non-derated faults and discuss the implications of designing future cross-layer solutions. Overall, not only CriticalFault is highly effective in identifying relevant test cases for current systems, but reliability researchers and engineers can also conduct more in-depth and meaningful analysis in deveoping future reliability solutions using CriticalFault. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={As main memory systems begin to face the scaling challenges from DRAM technology, future computer systems need to adapt to the emerging memory technologies like Phase-Change Memory (PCM or PRAM). While these newer technologies offer advantages such as storage density, non-volatility, and low energy consumption, they are constrained by limited write endurance that becomes more pronounced with process variation. In this paper, we propose a novel PRAM-based main memory system, RePRAM (Recycling PRAM), which leverages a group of faulty pages and recycles them in a managed way to significantly extend the PRAM lifetime while minimizing the performance impact. In particular, we explore two different dimensions of dynamic redundancy levels and group sizes, and design low-cost hardware and software support for RePRAM. Our proposed scheme involves minimal hardware modifications (that have less than 1% on-chip and off-chip area overheads). Also, our schemes can improve the PRAM lifetime by up to 43× (times) over a chip with no error correction capabilities, and outperform prior schemes such as DRM and ECP at a small fraction of the hardware cost. The performance overhead resulting from our scheme is less than 7% on average across 21 applications from SPEC2006, Splash-2, and PARSEC benchmark suites. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={It is not uncommon to have petrochemical facilities such as refineries, natural gas processing facilities and pipe line projects located in cold and arctic regions. The snow and ice considerations of the non-building structures and the components present unique design considerations for engineers. Non-building structures such as pipe bridges, pipe racks, multi level open equipment structures, storage tanks, electrical cable tray, air coolers, and equipment supporting structures retain snow differently than buildings. ASCE 7 does not have specific provisions for snow and ice on non building structures and components. Process Industry Practices (PI) and American Petroleum Institute (API) recommendations do not give comprehensive design procedures or guidelines for calculating snow and ice loads on non-building structures and components. Engineering judgment is used for adapting the snow and ice provisions for buildings to non-building structures. Calculation of the snow and ice loads becomes even more critical if the facility in a high seismic zone due to the added seismic mass. This paper provides recommendations for calculating the snow and ice loads for non-building structures and components based on the knowledge and experience of the authors. Snow loading on specific non-building structures are examined and recommendations based on current industry practices are presented. © ASCE 2012.},

abstract={Achieving very high localization accuracy in wireless networks that measure time of arrival (TOA) is a challenging task, especially when low cost hardware is used. The local oscillators used in the wireless nodes will drift over time, which will result in frequency and time offset between different clocks. Synchronization between the clocks must be maintained to obtain highly accurate TOA measurements. The delay in the radio frequency electronics can also vary with time and environmental variation and for accurate localization this variation must be accounted for as well. Although calibrating these parameters prior to the operation of the network is one solution, it is not an option for networks that operate for longer periods of time or those that are rapidly deployed. In this paper we propose an algorithm that jointly tracks the frequency offset and radio delay of all the nodes in the network along with the location of the mobile nodes. The algorithm calculates the round trip delay measurements, which eliminates the need to estimate the time offset. We also derive the posterior Cramèr Rao lower bound (PCRLB) for the joint estimation problem, which provides a bound on the maximum performance achievable. Through simulations we show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is in close agreement with the PCRLB for both the non-kinematic and kinematic state estimation. © 2012 IEEE.},

MEMS gyroscopes, some accelerometers and clocks utilize mechanical resonators. High-quality factor, low-frequency resonator devices with damping time constants from seconds to several minutes pose special characterization challenges. The proposed system uses the commercial "USRP" software defined radio (SDR) hardware and open source GnuRadio software as a platform for the proposed characterization and control system. For characterization of resonators, we developed software to perform dual channel swept-frequency gain-phase analysis, impulse response real-time spectral analysis, and ring down testing which achieve performance comparable to dedicated commercial hardware. To highlight the capabilities of the characterization tools, we implemented an automatic mode matching algorithm in the software. The same hardware is used for control of gyroscopes in either rate or rate integrating modes.

abstract={The availability of low-cost hardware coupled with the advancement of VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) technology has promoted the development of wireless multimedia sensor network (WMSN). However, the strict constraints in terms of processing power, storage, bandwidth etc. pose a great challenge to data processing in WMSN. Transmitting raw data is very costly while limited processing power prevents sophisticated multimedia processing. Exploring low-overhead data compression technique is a solution towards this problem. In this paper we propose an energy-saving audio data compression technique for WMSN combining wavelet lifting with a newly proposed difference detection technique. We consider the application domain where data are co-related. To exploit this co-relation we propose to run one wavelet round followed by a dynamic number of difference round and thereby, local communication overhead is saved compared to pure wavelet based scheme without sacrificing the target of sending data with less number of bits to the sink. Moreover, in addition to capturing spatial correlation by wavelet, this scheme captures temporal correlation by introducing the difference detection round. Performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated through simulation where efficacy of the scheme is not only evaluated in terms of energy consumption but also by computing SNR. The scheme is compared with one of the existing schemes. The results confirm our scheme's supremacy over the competing scheme both in terms of energy saving and signal reconstruction quality (SNR). © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={In this study, a Pseudo three-dimensional Vision-based Nail-fold Morphological and Hemodynamic Analysis (PTVNMHA) is proposed to automatically extract morphological/hemodynamic features from a microscopic nail-fold image sequence, reconstruct the corresponding pseudo three-dimensional microvascular models, and visualize the dynamic blood flow in the model constructed. The morphological features extracted include the number, width/height, density, arteriolar limb caliber, curved segment caliber, venular limb caliber, blood color, tortuosity, and width of the curved segment of capillaries. The hemodynamic features identified are blood flow velocity and blood flow rate. All are significant pathological indicators with a spatial precision up to 1.6μm. The diameters of cross-sections along the centerlines of capillaries are identified and employed to reconstruct the pseudo three-dimensional microvascular surface meshes. The microscopic image sequence acquired is mapped to the corresponding microvascular model constructed to perform dynamic blood flow visualization. Compared with laser Doppler velocimetry, PTVNMHA can derive blood flow velocities for each capillary across the microscopic range separately in much higher precision and obtain diversified morphological and hemodynamic features of capillaries with a low-cost equipment setup. In addition to the blood flow velocity, blood flow rate, which keeps almost constant no matter where the measuring position is in a capillary, has also been measured and proposed as a useful feature to discriminate patients with hypertension from the normal with great significance (p<0.001). In the future, large scale experiments will be conducted to diagnose patients with anemia as well as patients with essential and secondary hypertension to verify effectiveness of the PTVNMHA system. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The commercial success of open source software, along with a broader socio-cultural shift towards participation in media and cultural production, have inspired attempts to extend and expand open source practices. These include expansions from software into general culture through 'Free Culture' movements and, more recently, expansions from software into hardware and design. This article provides a critical perspective on the democratic potential of these broader 'open' contribution structures by examining how open source contributions to both software and hardware increase the opportunities for democratic participation in production, governance and knowledge exchange. By analysing attempts to 'open source' the sharing of hardware designs, it also notes the limitations of this democratization. The insights developed in the article nuance the relationship between open source cultures and commercial and market structures, identifying how the generative opportunities created by certain aspects of open source contribution structures increase the potential for democratizing production of communication tools, but also how incongruities across different open-source cultures and communities of practice limit the democratic potential of these processes. © The Author(s) 2012.},

abstract={Predefined sequences of eye movements, or 'gaze gestures', can be consciously performed by humans and monitored non-invasively using remote video oculography. Gaze gestures hold great potential in human-computer interaction, HCI, as long as they can be easily assimilated by potential users, monitored using low cost gaze tracking equipment and machine learning algorithms are able to distinguish the spatio-temporal structure of intentional gaze gestures from typical gaze activity performed during standard HCI. In this work, an evaluation of the performance of a bioinspired Bayesian pattern recognition algorithm known as Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) on the real time recognition of gaze gestures is carried out through a user study. To improve the performance of traditional HTM during real time recognition, an extension of the algorithm is proposed in order to adapt HTM to the temporal structure of gaze gestures. The extension consists of an additional top node in the HTM topology that stores and compares sequences of input data by sequence alignment using dynamic programming. The spatio-temporal codification of a gesture in a sequence serves the purpose of handling the temporal evolution of gaze gestures instances. The extended HTM allows for reliable discrimination of intentional gaze gestures from otherwise standard human-machine gaze interaction reaching up to 98 recognition accuracy for a data set of 10 categories of gaze gestures, acceptable completion speeds and a low rate of false positives during standard gaze-computer interaction. These positive results despite the low cost hardware employed supports the notion of using gaze gestures as a new HCI paradigm for the fields of accessibility and interaction with smartphones, tablets, projected displays and traditional desktop computers. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Hardware designs that can support multiple standards are required for versatile media players. The study proposes a unified inverse transform architecture that can be efficiently used in Moving Picture Expert Group and ITU International Telecommunication Standardisation Sector (ITU-T) H.264/advanced video coding (AVC), Microsoft video codec 1 (VC-1) and Chinese Audio Video Coding Standard (AVS) decoders. For H.264/AVC 8-, 4- and 2-point inverse transforms, the computational complexity in the proposed architecture is similar to that defined in the H.264/AVC standard. By using the symmetry of the transform matrices, the matrix product operations of the inverse transforms in VC-1 and AVS are efficiently decomposed to use only shifters, adders and subtractors. All the computations are verified and designed using a hardware unit to achieve a low-cost hardware kernel. The proposed multiple-transform architecture contains fast 1-D transforms and rounding operations for the computation of H.264/AVC, VC-1 and AVS 8- and 4-point inverse transforms. Simulation results show that the total number of gates for the proposed architecture is 8983, which is much lower than that required for architectures without hardware sharing. Compared with individual designs, the proposed shared architecture reduces the number of logic gates by a factor of two with a penalty of 20% in data throughput. © 2012 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.},

abstract={Open source hardware is a type of hardware where the schematics and designs are made unrestricted and available to all. They are often accompanied by open source software. This can bring reliability, ease of debugging, and modular development for rapid prototyping using pre-written libraries. Merits of using open source hardware are discussed and then applied to a portable sensor system based on the open hardware Arduino-derived Jeenode microcontroller board. The system uses an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and seamless integration of other sensors, including a piezo-resistive pressure sensor. It is shown that open source hardware can help to increase rapid development, reduce costs, and encourage further development. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Until recently, known fault attacks against (non-CRT) exponentiation-based cryptosystems were supposed to be of rather theoretical nature, as they require a precise fault injection, e.g., a bit flip. However, Schmidt and Herbst (FDTC 2008) reported practical fault-attacks against RSA in standard mode using low-cost equipment. Although their attacks were described against RSA, they readily extend to any other exponentiation-based cryptosystem.

abstract={Strong pressure on deployment of embedded control systems on a low-cost hardware leads to the need of optimizing software architectures to minimize resource demands. Nevertheless, releasing the resources not needed in specific phases of system execution is only rarely supported by todays component frameworks, mainly since information about the system state is spread over several components, which makes the idea hard to implement. The paper introduces a formal model of property networks allowing for efficient capture of modifications of architecture-relevant information and shows, how this model can be used to employ the concept of modes for system architectures in hierarchical component systems.

But the performance of the IMUs to provide sub-meter accuracy over a longer period of time is still not sufficient, so different approaches have been adopted to increase the performance at the cost of extra hardware and/or infrastructure. Our solution is based on the use of already existing radio infrastructure, where amplitude and phase variations in a received radio signal at the user terminal is used together with the IMU to do a tightly coupled estimation of navigation and radio signalmultipath components. The results show that the approach has the potential to enhance the performance of IMU based navigation significantly. © 2012 Institute of Telecommunica.},

Analysis of signal statistics for two example applications, i.e., motion estimation and disparity estimation, is presented. This information is then specifically incorporated in the hardware design process to develop approximate squarers which outperform existing designs in hardware resource savings and performance while processing real-world data. Specifically, the proposed architectures make distinction between low- and high-entropy portions of the input data to intelligently trade off bit precision with hardware complexity. Mathematical and experimental results show mean-relative-error figures to be as low as 1.2% and the performance to be as good as conventional full-precision processing scenarios.

To overcome these weaknesses, some authors have proposed a specially designed pad generation (PadGen) function to improve security. The PadGen function is used to produce a cover-coding pad to mask the tag's access password before the data are transmitted. In this paper, we study the radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag-reader mutual authentication (TRMA) scheme. Two improved authentication protocols for generating the PadGen function are described. A hardware design of these RFID authentication protocols conforming to the International Standards Organization 18000-6 Type-C protocol, also known as EPC C1G2 RFID protocol, is proposed. Since tags have an extremely limited computing power and storage capacity, the PadGen function based on exclusive-or operation for low-cost hardware implementation is reported in this study. The proposed RFID TRMA protocol was simulated using Modelsim XE II and synthesized using Altera's Quartus II software. The functionality of these strengthening protocols was successfully verified in hardware using an Altera DE2 board that included an Altera Cyclone II field-programmable gate array. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Recently, there is a new kinds of cryptographic algorithms are proposed to meet the requirements of "lightweight" applications. PRESENT is one of them, which is built based on 4-bit substitution transformation (S-box) and suitable for low cost hardware implementations. Usually, there needs two 4-bit S-boxes, Sp, ISp, for PRESENT encryption and decryption, in which ISp can be computed from Sp. Therefore, we proposed a unified architecture to supporting the operations of PRESENT encryption and decryption. There also exists a kind of power analysis attacks pose a serious threat on hardware based PRESENT. In order to resist against DPA, we proposed a new masking scheme for PRESENT, in which the nonlinear substitution needs to be carefully masked. In order to reduce the hardware resources for the proposed masking scheme, we reuse the masked Sp to generate masked ISp. The experimental results show that our proposed unified masked PRESENT takes up only one time larger than the unmasked existing design. But, it is obvious that our proposed design has the ability to defend against DPA. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={MapReduce has emerged as a promising architecture for large scale data analytics on commodity clusters. The rapid adoption of Hive, a SQL-like data processing language on Hadoop (an open source implementation of MapReduce), shows the increasing importance of processing structured data on MapReduce platforms. MapReduce offers several attractive properties such as the use of low-cost hardware, fault-tolerance, scalability, and elasticity. However, these advantages have required a substantial performance sacrifice. In this paper we introduce Clydesdale, a novel system for structured data processing on Hadoop - a popular implementation of MapReduce. We show that Clydesdale provides more than an order of magnitude in performance improvements compared to existing approaches without requiring any changes to the underlying platform. Clydesdale is aimed at workloads where the data fits a star schema. It draws on column oriented storage, tailored join-plans, and multi-core execution strategies and carefully fits them into the constraints of a typical MapReduce platform. Using the star schema benchmark, we show that Clydesdale is on average 38x faster than Hive. This demonstrates that MapReduce in general, and Hadoop in particular, is a far more compelling platform for structured data processing than previous results suggest. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Small-scale and household low-cost technologies to provide water free of arsenic for drinking purposes, suitable for isolated rural and periurban areas not connected to water networks in Latin America are described. Some of them are merely adaptation of conventional technologies already used at large and medium scale, but others are environmentally friendly emerging procedures that use local materials and resources of the affected zone. The technologies require simple and low-cost equipment that can be easily handled and maintained by the local population. The methods are based on the following processes: combination of coagulation/flocculation with adsorption, adsorption with geological and other low-cost natural materials, electrochemical technologies, biological methods including phytoremediation, use of zerovalent iron and photochemical processes. Examples of relevant research studies and developments in the region are given. In some cases, processes have been tested only at the laboratory level and there is not enough information about the costs. However, it is considered that the presented technologies constitute potential alternatives for arsenic removal in isolated rural and periurban localities of Latin America. Generation, handling and adequate disposal of residues should be taken into account in all cases. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

We rigorously examine the architecture, techniques and algorithms that make decentralized or "ad-hoc," ultrawideband networks work in the presence of hostile jamming or protocol attacks. We illustrate the RF link-budget using 3-d graphs to show how interference affects the network performance as these networks become heavily utilized or jammed. Using low-cost hardware, self-organizing routing software, and uncoordinated/distributed CDMA we show how they can retain adequate system capacity even under heavy load from users or interference from jammers. Open standardization and field trials of SocialMesh networks will further clarify SocialMesh security and performance by opening up the design specifications to international review.

abstract={The United States is suffering from an aging civil infrastructure crisis. Key to recovery are rapid inspection technologies like that being investigated by the VOTERS project (Versatile Onboard Traffic Embedded Roaming Sensors), which aims to outfit ordinary road vehicles with compact low-cost hardware that enables them to rapidly assess and report the condition of roadways and bridge decks free of driver interaction. A key piece of hardware, and the focus of this paper, is a 24 GHz millimeter-wave radar system that measures the reflectivity of pavement surfaces. To account for the variability of real-world driving, such as changes in height, angle, speed, and temperature, a sensor fusion approach is used that corrects MWR measurements based on data from four additional sensors. The corrected MWR measurements are expected to be useful for various characterization applications, including: material type; deterioration such as cracks and potholes; and surface coverage conditions such as dry, wet, oil, water, and ice. Success at each of these applications is an important step towards achieving the VOTERS objective, however, this paper focuses on surface coverage, as whatever covers the driving surface will be most apparent to the MWR sensor and if not accounted for could significantly limit the accuracy of other applications. Contributions of the paper include findings from static lab tests, which validate the approach and show the effects of height and angle. Further contributions come from lab and in-field dynamic tests, which show the effects of speed and demonstrate that the MWR approach is accurate under city driving conditions. © 2012 SPIE.},

abstract={The evaluation of nutritional or functional components in grain products is an important feature for the industry, especially when recent regulations require a correct nutrition labelling, valid during all the shelf life of the product. For that reason, industry usually makes many efforts to develop simple and reliable analytical methods that can be easily applied in any quality control laboratories for routine analysis. Spectrofluorimetric analysis of thiamine and riboflavin are sensitive, but need specific equipment. A few HPLC-UV methods have been described but they are less sensitive, and present difficulties due to interfering compounds, particularly in complex food matrixes, as grains and derivatives. A combination of extraction and separation systems, that allows enough sensitivity, precision and accuracy for the analysis of vitamin B 1 and B 2 in complex cereal food products, by isocratic UV-HPLC, in a single wavelength simultaneous separation is presented, with the advantage of using low-cost equipment requirements, simple sample pre-treatment and short time. The achievement of this goal has involved the optimization of compatible extraction and measurement protocols for cereal matrices, comparing seven different separation conditions and six extraction/clarification matrices analysis. The selected method was comparatively validated and compared to reference AOAC spectrofluorimetric methods, providing comparable linearity and accuracy, with better specificity and precision parameters, as well as practical applicability. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Problem The Brazilian population lacks equitable access to specialized health care and diagnostic tests, especially in remote municipalities, where health professionals often feel isolated and staff turnover is high. Telehealth has the potential to improve patients' access to specialized health care, but little is known about it in terms of cost-effectiveness, access to services or user satisfaction. Approach In 2005, the State Government of Minas Gerais, Brazil, funded the establishment of the Telehealth Network, intended to connect university hospitals with the state's remote municipal health departments; support professionals in providing tele-assistance; and perform tele-electrocardiography and teleconsultations. The network uses low-cost equipment and has employed various strategies to overcome the barriers to telehealth use. Local setting The Telehealth Network connects specialists in state university hospitals with primary health-care professionals in 608 municipalities of the large state of Minas Gerais, many of them in remote areas. Relevant changes From June 2006 to October 2011, 782 773 electrocardiograms and 30 883 teleconsultations were performed through the network, and 6000 health professionals were trained in its use. Most of these professionals (97%) were satisfied with the system, which was cost-effective, economically viable and averted 81% of potential case referrals to distant centres. Lessons learnt To succeed, a telehealth service must be part of a collaborative network, meet the real needs of local health professionals, use simple technology and have at least some face-to-face components. If applied to health problems for which care is in high demand, this type of service can be economically viable and can help to improve patient access to specialized health care.},

abstract={Conventionally, a frequency can be uniquely determined when the sampling rate is higher than the Nyquist rate. In some applications, such as sensor network with low transmission rate sensors, it is necessary that the sampling rate to be under the Nyquist rate; in this case, a frequency determination method based on its under-sampled waveform is needed. Several studies have been done to extract real input frequency from under-sampled sinusoidal complex waveform. This paper presents a novel method for unambiguous and unique frequency determination of under-sampled real sinusoidal waveform. The proposed method needs a low cost hardware in compare with the frequency determination of under-sampled sinusoidal complex waveform. First, we determine the upper frequency bound which the frequency can be extracted unambiguously from under-sampled real sinusoidal waveform. Then, in order to extract real input frequency unambiguously and uniquely, the maximum tolerable amount of frequency error is determined from under-sampled sinusoidal real waveform. Moreover, we improve the previous method for frequency determination from under-sampled sinusoidal complex waveform. Finally, performance of the proposed schemes is verified by some simulation results. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={An accurate and low-cost hybrid solution to the problem of autonomous self-localization in wireless sensor networks (WSN) is presented. The solution is designed to perform robustly under challenging radio propagation conditions in mind, while requiring low deployment efforts, and utilizing only low-cost hardware and light-weight distributed algorithms for location computation. Our solution harnesses the strengths of two approaches for environments with complex propagation characteristics: RF mapping to provide an initial estimate of each sensor's position based on a coarse-grain RF map acquired with minimal efforts; and a cooperative light-weight spring relaxation technique for each sensor to refine its estimate using Kalman filtered inter-node distance measurements. Using Kalman filtering to pre-process noisy distance measurements inherent in complex propagation environments, is found to have significant positive impacts on the subsequent accuracy and the convergence of our spring relaxation algorithm. Through extensive simulations using realistic settings and real data set, we show that our approach is a practical localization solution which can achieve sub-meter accuracy and fast convergence under harsh propagation conditions, with no specialized hardware or significant efforts required to deploy. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Urban spaces are pervaded by interpretive and reactive technologies that shape and are shaped by its inhabitants, with an increasingly active role for citizen technologists. Yet the role of domestic spaces in shaping lived experience within the urban environment, and subsequent technological interventions, is often overlooked. Homes are framed as closed-off environments which isolate their inhabitants from the city, despite being porous spaces that are also filled with ubiquitous computing. In this paper we draw on the participatory design and user innovation literatures to present the methodology for the "Homesense" research project that explored how users design and develop "smart" technologies within their own homes, based on the intersection of their concurrent urban/domestic lived experience. Kits of open-source hardware were used as cultural probes, and co-located "lead users" provided technical expertise. This methodology demonstrates the importance of physical space and location in user-led domestic activities, and of combinations of technical and "lived" expertise in developing these interventions. © 2012 Copyright The Society of Urban Technology.},

abstract={Microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs) are superconducting detectors capable of counting single photons and measuring their energy in the UV, optical, and near-IR. MKIDs feature intrinsic frequency domain multiplexing (FDM) at microwave frequencies, allowing the construction and readout of large arrays. Due to the microwave FDM, MKIDs do not require the complex cryogenic multiplexing electronics used for similar detectors, such as transition edge sensors, but instead transfer this complexity to room temperature electronics where they present a formidable signal processing challenge. In this paper, we describe the first successful effort to build a readout for a photon counting optical/near-IR astronomical instrument, the ARray Camera for Optical to Near-infrared Spectrophotometry. This readout is based on open source hardware developed by the Collaboration for Astronomy Signal Processing and Electronics Research. Designed principally for radio telescope backends, it is flexible enough to be used for a variety of signal processing applications. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract={Modern hardware security has a very broad scope ranging from digital rights management to the detection of ghost circuitry. These and many other security tasks are greatly hindered by process variation, which makes each integrated circuit (IC) unique, and device aging, which evolves the IC throughout its lifetime. We have developed a singular value decomposition (SVD)-based procedure for gate-level characterization (GLC) that calculates changes in properties, such as delay and switching power of each gate of an IC, accounting for process variation and device aging. We employ our SVD-based GLC approach for the development of two security applications: hardware metering and ghost circuitry (GC) detection. We present the first robust and low-cost hardware metering scheme, using an overlapping IC partitioning approach that enables rapid and scalable treatment. We also map the GC detection problem into an equivalent task of GLC consistency checking using the same overlapping partitioning. The effectiveness of the approaches is evaluated using the ISCAS85, ISCAS89, and ITC99 benchmarks. In hardware metering, we are able to obtain probabilities of coincidence in the magnitude of 10 -8 or less, and we obtain zero false positives and zero false negatives in GC detection. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={Future microprocessors need low-cost solutions for reliable operation in the presence of failure-prone devices. A promising approach is to detect hardware faults by deploying low-cost monitors of software-level symptoms of such faults. Recently, researchers have shown these mechanisms work well, but there remains a non-negligible risk that several faults may escape the symptom detectors and result in silent data corruptions (SDCs). Most prior evaluations of symptom-based detectors perform fault injection campaigns on application benchmarks, where each run simulates the impact of a fault injected at a hardware site at a certain point in the application's execution (application fault site). Since the total number of application fault sites is very large (trillions for standard benchmark suites), it is not feasible to study all possible faults. Previous work therefore typically studies a randomly selected sample of faults. Such studies do not provide any feedback on the portions of the application where faults were not injected. Some of those instructions may be vulnerable to SDCs, and identifying them could allow protecting them through other means if needed. This paper presents Relyzer, an approach that systematically analyzes all application fault sites and carefully picks a small subset to perform selective fault injections for transient faults. Relyzer employs novel fault pruning techniques that prune faults that need detailed study by either predicting their outcomes or showing them equivalent to other faults. We find that Relyzer prunes about 99.78% of the total faults across twelve applications studied here, reducing the faults that require detailed simulation by 3 to 5 orders of magnitude for most of the applications. Fault injection simulations on the remaining faults can identify SDC causing faults in the entire application. Some of Relyzer's techniques rely on heuristics to determine fault equivalence. Our validation efforts show that Relyzer determines fault outcomes with 96% accuracy, averaged across all the applications studied here. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={This work describes a compact and low cost analyzer for laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) based on a diode pumped passively Q-switched Nd:LSB microchip laser and a conventional Czerny-Turner spectrograph (spectral range from about 250 to 390 nm) containing a non-intensified, non-gated and non-cooled 1024 pixel linear sensor array. The new LIBS instrument was applied for analyzing steel samples containing chromium and nickel in the concentration range from about 5 to 26% w/w (certified reference materials), integrating the emitted radiation for 40 s under continuous application of laser pulses at 2 kHz for each acquired spectrum (integration of about 80,000 plasmas). The emission data from about 356 to 362 nm and 340 to 354 nm were employed for the construction of two Partial Least Squares (PLS) calibration models for determination of chromium and nickel, respectively. The average relative errors of prediction of chromium and nickel concentrations were 3.7 and 6.7%, respectively, which are similar to or lower than those obtained using higher cost LIBS analyzers. The results have shown that multivariate calibration can help to overcome the decreasing instrumental performance associated with the low cost equipment. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Continuous fiber reinforced plastics with a thermoplastic matrix are recyclable, weldable and suitable for many structural applications. Due to the short cycle times of about 1 minute, forming processes for thermoplastic composite parts are already capable of series production. Two of the most important forming techniques are Matched Die Forming and Diaphragm Forming. The Matched Die Forming provides short cycle times and high processing temperatures but requires complex and expensive molds. The Diaphragm Forming Process enables the use of low cost tooling and machinery and provides a high degree of flexibility. On the other hand its processing temperature range is limited to 250 °C due to the silicone diaphragms, which are used for cost-efficient series production. The paper presents anew processing technique that was developed at IKV Aachen and combines the advantages of both processes. These particularly are a big variety ofprocessable matrices and low cost equipment with a high degree offlexibility. The developed machinery like the new handling system, the innovative IR-heating station and the modified forming technique are described in detail. The development focuses on a temporal reduction of the thermal load of the diaphragms by using them only for the forming process. As a result, the processing temperature range has been extended from 250 °C to 320 °C so that it is now possible to additionally process PA6, PA66 and PPS based prepregs.},

abstract={Normalized Difference Vegetation Indices (NDVIs) are typically determined using satellite or airborne remote sensing, or field portable spectrometers, which give an averaged signal on centimetre to metre scale plots. Biological soil crust (BSC) patches may have smaller sizes, and ecophysiological, hydrological as well as pedological processes may be heterogeneously distributed within this level of resolution. A ground-based NDVI imaging procedure using low-cost equipment (Olympus Camedia 5000z digital camera equipped with a Hoya R72 infrared filter) was developed in this study to fill this gap at the level of field research, where carrying costly and bulky equipment to remote locations is often the limiting factor for data collection. Method principle and field data are presented, and the field experiment was deepened comparing NDVI measurements and CO 2 turnover of soil crust samples in the laboratory, backing the reliability of the approach.A commercially available colour rendition chart with known red (600-700nm) and NIR (800-900nm) reflectances was placed into each scene and used for calibration purposes on a per-image basis. Generation of NDVI images involved (i) determination of red and NIR reflectances from the pixel values of the red and NIR channels, respectively, and (ii) calculation and imaging of the NDVI, where NDVI values of -1 to +1 were mapped to grey values of 0 to 255. The correlation between NDVI values retrieved from these images and NDVI values determined using field spectrometry was close (r 2=0.91), the 95% confidence interval amounted to 0.10 NDVI units. The pixel resolution was 0.8mm in the field and 0.2mm in the laboratory, but can still be improved significantly with closer distance to the crust or with higher camera resolution. NDVI values obtained using the new method were related to the net CO 2 uptake of BSCs, where both slope and correlation coefficient of the respective regression function conformed with literature data. Geostatistical analysis revealed that both spatial variability of net CO 2 uptake as well as size of individual hot spots of this parameter increased with crust development. The latter never exceeded 4mm in the investigated crusts, which points to the necessity of high resolution imaging for linking remote sensing with ecophysiology. Perspectively, the new method could be used for field monitoring of both biological soil crusts and vascular vegetation. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose hPIN/hTAN, a low-cost hardware token based PIN/TAN system for protecting e-banking systems against the strong threat model where the adversary has full control over the user's computer. This threat model covers various kinds of attacks related to untrusted terminal computers, such as keyloggers, screen scrapers, session hijackers, Trojan horses and transaction generators. The core of hPIN/hTAN is a secure and easy user-computer-token interface. The security is guaranteed by the user-computer-token interface and two underlying security protocols for user/server/transaction authentication. The hPIN/hTAN system is designed as an open framework so that the underlying authentication protocols can be easily reconfigured. To minimize the costs and maximize usability, we chose two security protocols dependent on simple cryptography (a cryptographic hash function). In contrast to other hardware-based solutions, hPIN/hTAN depends on neither a second trusted channel nor a secure keypad nor external trusted center. Our prototype implementation does not involve cryptography beyond a cryptographic hash function. The minimalistic design can also help increase security because more complicated systems tend to have more security holes. As an important feature, hPIN/hTAN exploits human users' active involvement in the whole process to compensate security weaknesses caused by careless human behavior. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

Then Adafruit fielded the part premounted on a small pc board with a couple of chip resistors and some headers, along with a tutorial as well as a software library for the open-source Arduino platform. Digi-Key Corp. had a similar start back in 1972, selling its Digi-Keyer Kit to ham radio enthusiasts. Today it is a $1 billion company.

abstract={This paper describes a new experimental approach for fatigue life assessment of structures based on the equivalent stiffness determined by surface bonded piezo-impedance transducers through the electro-mechanical impedance (EMI) technique. The remaining life of the component (in terms of the cycles of loading that can be sustained) is non-dimensionally correlated with the equivalent identified stiffness. The proposed approach circumvents the determination of the absolute stiffness of the joint and employs the admittance signature of the surface-bonded piezo-transducers directly. The second part of the paper briefly describes the recent advances made in the field of impedance based structural health monitoring (SHM) in terms of low-cost hardware system and improved damage diagnosis through the integration of global dynamic and EMI techniques using the same set of piezo-sensors. Other recent applications such as bio-sensors and traffic sensors pioneered at the Smart Structures and Dynamics Laboratory (SSDL) are also briefly covered.},

abstract={The FireFader is a simple haptic force-feedback device that is optimized for introducing musician to haptics. It has one degree of freedom and is based upon a mass-produced linear potentiometer fader coupled to a DC motor, also known as a "motorized fader." Lights are connected in parallel with the motor to help visually communicate the strength of the force. Compatible with OS X, Linux, and Windows, the FireFader consists of only open-source hardware and software elements. Consequently, it is also relatively easy for users to re-purpose it into new projects involving varying kinds and numbers of motors and sensors. An open-source device driver for the FireFader allows it to be linked to a laptop computer via USB so that the computer can perform the feedback control calculations. For example, the laptop can simulate the acoustics of a virtual musical instrument to calculate the motor force as a function of the fader position. The serial connection over USB causes delay of the control signal, but the serial connection facilitates easier programming via the laptop, and the force feedback can be disabled when the user is not touching the fader. Some new devices derived from the FireFader design are presented. © 2012 Edgar Berdahl et al.},

abstract={Measuring the height of the vertical jump is an indicator of the strength and power of the lower body. The technological tools available to measure the vertical jump are black boxes and are not open to third-party verification or adaptation. We propose the creation of a measurement system called Chronojump-Boscosystem, consisting of open hardware and free software. Methods: A microcontroller was created and validated using a square wave generator and an oscilloscope. Two types of contact platforms were developed using different materials. These platforms were validated by the minimum pressure required for activation at different points by a strain gauge, together with the on/off time of our platforms in respect of the Ergojump-Boscosystem platform by a sample of 8 subjects performing submaximal jumps with one foot on each platform. Agile methodologies were used to develop and validate the software. Results: All the tools fall under the free software / open hardware guidelines and are, in that sense, free. The microcontroller margin of error is 0.1%. The validity of the fiberglass platform is 0.95 (ICC). The management software contains nearly 113.000 lines of code and is available in 7 languages.},

abstract={Vehicles using controller area networks (CANs) for on-board device communications may have event data recorders (EDRs) that either capture or reflect network feeds from an array of sensors and other electronic control units. Using the data recorded in an EDR for investigative purposes requires external verification of accuracy. However, conducting external tests that set events can be expensive due to the time and equipment involved. This paper proposes a practical verification method that uses CAN bus monitoring tools to compare vehicle network traffic to external measurements. The premise of this work is that data reliability from an EDR can be determined if the reliability of the network data source for the EDR can be determined. Once the reliability of the source is determined, the reliability of the event data can be quantified based on effects of truncation and sampling. Furthermore, message timing and frequency can be quantified based on timestamps from the network analysis tool. Two examples of data analysis are given. The first example shows how to reverse engineer CAN messages from a Mini Cooper and the second example shows the comparison of J1939 message traffic to a sudden deceleration record from a Paccar PX-8 engine. Finally, a low cost hardware/software solution based on the Arduino platform is described to enable such measurements. Copyright © 2012 SAE International.},

abstract={A continuous-time plant with discretized continuous-time controller do not yield stability if the sampling rate is lower than some certain level. Thus far, high functioning electronic control has made use of high cost hardwares which are needed to implement discretized continuous-time controllers, while low cost hardwares generally do not have high enough sampling rate. This technical note presents results comparing performance indices with and without intersample behavior, and some answer to the question how a low specification device can control a plant effectively. We consider a machine simulating wafer handling robots at semiconductor factories, which is an electromechanical system driven by a direct drive motor. We illustrate controller design for the robot with and without intersample behavior, and simulations and experimental results by using these controllers. Taking intersample behavior into account proves to be effective to make control performance better and enables it to choose relatively long sampling period. By controller design via performance index with intersample behavior, we can cope with situation where short enough sampling period may not be employed, and freedom of controller design might be widened especially on choice of sampling period. © 2012 The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.},

abstract={"Atoms are the new bits". That is the latest buzz arising from the Californian trade press. What do we get when this dictum is sampled with the old rallying cry: "Information wants to be free"? We suggest that the predominant, bounded critique of intellectual property is thereby destabilised. Constitutive of that critique was the exceptionality attributed to infor-mation goods (bits) vis-a-vis tangible goods (atoms). It was thus intellectual property could be presented as something altogether different from private property. We recognise that this way of framing the issue has had tactical advantages, but contend that it has stood in the way of a deeper understanding of what intellectual property is. When the critique of proprie-tary software is expanded by an emerging movement for open hardware development, however, the boundary between intellectual property and property as such crumbles. This enables us to renew our critique of the political economy of infor-mation.},

abstract={We experimentally demonstrate a low-cost hardware technique for synthesizing a specific electromagnetic pulse shape to improve a time-domain microwave breast imaging system. A synthesized broadband reflector (SBR) filter structure is used to reshape a generic impulse to create an ad-hoc pulse with a specifically chosen frequency spectrum that improves the detection and imaging capabilities of our experimental system. The tailored pulse shape benefits the system by improving the level of signal detection after transmission through the breast and thus permits higher-resolution images. We report on our ability to use this technique to detect the presence of tumours in realistic breast phantoms composed of varying quantities of glandular tissue. Additionally, we provide a set of images based on this experimental data that demonstrates the increased effectiveness of the system using the SBR-shaped pulse in the localisation and identification of the embedded tumour.},

abstract={Real-time monitoring of natural disasters, mass events, and large accidents with airborne optical sensors is an ongoing topic in research and development. Airborne monitoring is used as a complemental data source with the advantage of flexible data acquisition and higher spatial resolution compared to optical satellite data. In cases of disasters or mass events, optical high resolution image data received directly after acquisition are highly welcomed by security related organizations like police and rescue forces. Low-cost optical camera systems are suitable for real-time applications as the accuracy requirements can be lowered in return for faster processing times. In this paper, the performance of low-cost camera systems for real-time mapping applications is exemplarily evaluated based on already existing sensor systems operated at German Aerospace Center (DLR). Focus lies next to the geometrical and radiometric performance on the real time processing chain which includes image processors, thematic processors for automatic traffic extraction and automatic person tracking, data downlink to the ground station, and further processing and distribution on the ground. Finally, a concept for a national airborne rapid mapping service based on the low-cost hardware is proposed.},

abstract={Modeling and simulation are powerful tools to design power distribution systems made up of multiple converters and loads, such as the system of the more-electric aircraft (MEA). However, a system designer usually has no access to detailed data of the power converters, due to confidentiality of manufacturers. Therefore, a black-box modeling approach is necessary. This paper proposes a large-signal black-box modeling technique of three-phase voltage source inverters. The resulting model is oriented to perform system-level analysis and is fully parameterized from the transient response of the converter, which is obtained through simple experimental tests based on low-cost equipment. Moreover, it does not represent the internal data of the converter, thus keeping the confidentiality of the manufacturer. The proposed method has been experimentally validated on a 5-kW actual inverter, which has been applied on the test bench of an MEA power distribution system. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Power-supply forms a key hardware block for every automotive ECU. Apart from delivering robust and reliable logic supply voltages it is also burdened with many auxiliary tasks like transient protection, good EMI/EMC performance, Power-hold function, Analog Sensor supply voltage etc. It also needs to meet all automotive norms including short to battery/ground etc. This paper discusses low cost implementation techniques which maximize the value delivered to the vehicle application at minimal cost. Innovative techniques are described for combining sensor and logic supplies wherever applicable. Hurdles faced during such circuit optimization are clearly explained along with the solutions adopted to overcome hurdles yet meeting automotive test norms. A novel low cost concept which combines transient protection as well as power-hold function (without using the conventional relay based technique) further adds value to the end application. The paper also includes lessons learnt during EMI/EMC tests and low cost solutions devised for the same. The paper ends with a case study for a real life ECU application and lists the relevant test-results to confirm that the circuit meets automotive norms including wave-forms during transient tests as well as power-hold tests.

abstract={A hands-on introduction to the field of embedded systems; A focus on fast prototyping of embedded systems; All key embedded system concepts covered through simple and effective experimentation; An understanding of ARM technology, one of the world's leaders; A practical introduction to embedded C; Applies possibly the most accessible set of tools available in the embedded world. This book is an introduction to embedded systems design, using the ARM mbed and C programming language as development tools. The mbed provides a compact, self-contained and low-cost hardware core, and the on-line compiler requires no download or installation, being accessible wherever an internet link exists. The book further combines these with a simple "breadboard" approach, whereby simple circuits are built up around the mbed, with no soldering or pcb assembly required. The book adopts a "learning through doing" approach. Each chapter is based around a major topic in embedded systems. The chapter proceeds as a series of practical experiments; the reader sets up a simple hardware system, develops and downloads a simple program, and immediately observes and tests the outcomes. The book then reflects on the experimental results, evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the technology or technique introduced, explores how precise the link is between theory and practice, and considers applications and the wider context. The only book that explains how to use ARM's mbed development toolkit to help the speedy and easy development of embedded systems. Teaches embedded systems core principles in the context of developing quick applications, making embedded systems development an easy task for the non specialist who does not have a deep knowledge of electronics or software All key concepts are covered through simple and effective experimentation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={We present the development of a four-channel low-cost hardware system for data acquisition, with application in dedicated nuclear medicine imagers. A 12 bit octal channel high-speed analogue to digital converter, with up to 65 Msps sampling rate, was used for the digitization of analogue signals. The digitized data are fed into a field programmable gate array (FPGA), which contains an interface to a bank of double data rate 2 (DDR2)-type memory. The FPGA processes the digitized data and stores the results into the DDR2. An ethernet link was used for data transmission to a personal computer. The embedded system was designed using Xilinx's embedded development kit (EDK) and was based on Xilinx's Microblaze soft-core processor. The system has been evaluated using two different discrete optical detector arrays (a position-sensitive photomultiplier tube and a silicon photomultiplier) with two different pixelated scintillator arrays (BGO, LSO:Ce). The energy resolution for both detectors was approximately 25%. A clear identification of all crystal elements was achieved in all cases. The data rate of the system with this implementation can reach 60 Mbits s -1. The results have shown that this FPGA data acquisition system is a compact and flexible solution for single-photon-detection applications. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.},
