Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a low cost hardware support for on-chip
   message passing mechanism in manycore processors. Data sharing is an
   important problem for manycore processor. As the scale of manycore
   processors increases, the penalty of multicasts from cache coherence
   protocol increases dramatically, which restricts the performance of
   on-chip communications. In order to improve the performance of
   inter-core communications, message passing is introduced into manycore
   processors. On-chip message passing buffers are designed to supply high
   performance message passing in manycore processors, which takes about
   5.26\% on-chip storage area. However, the utilization of on-chip storage
   is low due to the usage of lightweight cores in manycore processors, in
   which computing and data transmission will not work simultaneously. This
   paper proposes a message passing scheme via reusing the cache memories
   and logical circuits in state machine from original cache coherence
   protocols. With reusing of cache memories, only 0.01\% overhead in
   hardware costs are required to gain the similar performance with
   original message passing design. And our design with the same hardware
   costs gains 11\% improvements in overall performance.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of 5G mobile radio and its complex interaction with fixed
   access network infrastructures poses new challenges and opportunities.
   In this article, a software-defined converged fixed-mobile 5G
   architecture is introduced using carrier-grade Ethernet as a transport
   platform. An active remote node (ARN) is used to connect end-users.
   Powered at a radio base station, the ARN aggregates the traffic of fixed
   and mobile radio users. Transport capacity is reduced due to statistical
   multiplexing, and scalability is achieved by a modular design. The ARN
   enables software-defined networking (SDN) via the
   open-networks-as-a-service (Open NaaS) control and management plane.
   Adopting the Open Access model, this architecture offers both,
   multi-technology and multi-operator features. Next generation fronthaul,
   resource sharing, synchronization, low latency can all be established as
   services to build an advanced 5G infrastructure. Key concepts of the new
   architecture have been realized using low-cost hardware and offer
   economic high-speed, fixed and mobile Internet. E.g., for wireless
   connectivity to macro-and small cells, mm-wave links reaching 5 Gb/s and
   short-range optical wireless links have been used. As data rates can be
   scaled up, the proposed architecture is considered future-proof for
   converged 5G fixed-mobile access networks.}},

   and improved networks to provide students who cannot travel to the real
   facility with alternatives that provide comparable educational benefit.
   The virtual facility is augmented by visual guides and educational
   content to teach students about concentrating solar power technology. A
   teacher physically near the student can appear in the scene via depth
   camera imagery, allowing the teacher to walk around in a classroom
   setting and assist students. Additionally, work-in-progress is streaming
   the depth images over a network to allow students to virtually meet
   expert guides from the real facility. We summarize these features, some
   interaction-related challenges, and ongoing testing.}},

Abstract = {{Video transcoding plays a critical role in a video streaming service.
   Content owners and publishers need video transcoders to adapt their
   videos to different formats, bitrates, and qualities before streaming
   them to end users with the best quality of service. In this paper, we
   report our experience to develop and deploy VideoCoreCluster, a
   low-cost, highly efficient video transcoder cluster for live video
   streaming services. We implemented the video transcoder cluster with
   low-cost single board computers, specifically the Raspberry Pi Model B.
   The quality of the transcoded video delivered by our cluster is
   comparable with the best open source software-based video transcoder,
   and our video transcoders consume much less energy. We designed a
   scheduling algorithm based on priority and capacity so that the cluster
   manager can leverage the characteristics of adaptive bitrate video
   streaming technologies to provide a reliable and scalable service for
   the video streaming infrastructure. We have replaced the software-based
   transcoders for some TV channels in a live TV streaming service

Abstract = {{Companies producing consumer products have begun working on ways to
   control their products over the IP (Internet Protocol). The main feature
   provided by the already-existing home automation systems is that, every
   piece of equipment integrated is to be controlled by a central control
   system unit. Centralized solution based on this idea are very expensive,
   difficult to configure and more prone to problems because if the central
   control unit fails then every device becomes out of control. IP based
   systems are supposed to be simpler and easier to manipulate, with the
   only necessity being, connected to the network, Ethernet or Wi-Fi. With
   this in mind, we designed a low cost hardware and its requisite software
   framework based on distributed control system for home/commercial
   automation, in which every device would be connected with an electronic
   chip capable of communicating over the IP network and also being able to
   control the state of device, which includes switching and change in the
   device intensity. Furthermore additional circuitry has been added to
   turn on or off the device after certain period of user defined time. The
   beauty of this technique is that each device is its own control system
   and gets commands from the user via smart phone or even a web browser,
   if one device goes down then it doesn't affect the functioning of the
   rest of the devices. This paper seeks to pave the way for IP-enabling
   home appliances, making such devices part of well-known field the
   Internet of Things. Enabling each of these devices with capability of
   communicating over the network eliminates the need for special internet
   connected control units, and thus simplifying home automation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a computationally efficient, novel and superior
   nonlinear controller to the existing trajectory and orientation (T\& O)
   control problem of an omnidirectional robot (ODR). Here first, the
   position and orientation (pose) estimation of the robot were obtained
   utilizing kinematic relationships of the ODR and multi-sensor fusion
   techniques. Then, dynamic relationships of the robot were used to form
   its state-space representation. The nonlinear state-space representation
   (NLSSR) was linearized by identifying and controlling the nonlinearity
   causing states. Then that linearized NLSSR was utilized to derive a
   state feedback controller and a proportional derivative integral (PID)
   controller to carry out a T\& O tracking task. Performances of both
   derived controllers were evaluated in the simulation level comparing
   with a standard nonlinear controller. From the two proposed controllers,
   the best-performing, state feedback-based controller was able to be
   successfully implemented on a low-cost hardware platform due to its
   computational efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test becomes an effective
   approach in the design of automotive electronics. One issue of HIL
   system is that most commercial HIL products are very expensive. With
   careful analysis of the ECU functionality and reasonable use of the
   hardware resources, it is possible to realize a HIL system to fully
   satisfy the test requirements with much lower cost in many cases. In
   this paper, the possibilities to reduce the cost of current HIL systems
   are discussed. As a case study, the development of a low cost HIL system
   for a pure electric vehicle controller is presented, the modeling of the
   vehicle is introduced and the hardware and software implementations are
   given. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed HIL system is validated
   by experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) systems are recognized to be effective tools
   to support teaching in Controls, especially in laboratory courses,
   rather than only simulations, since a more realistic student experience
   is achieved with no need of the use of a real equipment. This naturally
   leads to a better use of the resources for both the students and the
   university facilities and a reduction of costs invested in laboratory
   equipment. This paper presents a low-cost HIL application for a mobile
   robot to support learning in Automatic Control and Robotics. It consists
   of a simulator of the robot, which is built by means of physical
   modeling tools in the MATLAB (R)/Simulink (R) environment, and an
   Arduino Yun board. The communication between the simulator and Arduino
   is done by TCP/IP. For illustration purposes, some examples of possible
   control coursewares to be carried out using the developed testbed are
   given. (C) 2016, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control)

Abstract = {{We describe an autonomous, fully functional implementation of the BB84
   quantum key distribution protocol using open source hardware
   microcontrollers for the synchronization, communication, key sifting and
   real-time key generation diagnostics. The quantum bits are prepared in
   the polarization of weak optical pulses generated with light emitting
   diodes, and detected using a sole single-photon counter and a temporally
   multiplexed scheme. The system generates a shared cryptographic key at a
   rate of 365 bps, with a raw quantum bit error rate of 2.7\%. A detailed
   description of the peripheral electronics for control, driving and
   communication between stages is released as supplementary material. The

Abstract = {{In this paper, we show that cache partitioning does not necessarily
   ensure predictable cache performance in modern COTS multicore platforms
   that use non-blocking caches to exploit memory-level-parallelism (MLP).
   Through carefully designed experiments using three real COTS multicore
   platforms (four distinct CPU architectures) and a cycle-accurate full
   system simulator, we show that special hardware registers in
   non-blocking caches, known as Miss Status Holding Registers (MSHRs),
   which track the status of outstanding cachemisses, can be a significant
   source of contention; we observe up to 21X WCET increase in a real COTS
   multicore platform due to MSHR contention.
   We propose a hardware and system software (OS) collaborative approach to
   efficiently eliminate MSHR contention for multicore real-time systems.
   Our approach includes a low-cost hardware extension that enables dynamic
   control of per-core MLP by the OS. Using the hardware extension, the OS
   scheduler then globally controls each core's MLP in such a way that
   eliminates MSHR contention and maximizes overall throughput of the
   system.
   We implement the hardware extension in a cycle-accurate full-system
   simulator and the scheduler modification in Linux 3.14 kernel. We
   evaluate the effectiveness of our approach using a set of synthetic and
   macro benchmarks. In a case study, we achieve up to 19\% WCET reduction
   (average: 13\%) for a set of EEMBC benchmarks compared to a baseline
   cache partitioning setup.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to design intelligent robots
   operating in such dynamic environments like the RoboCup Middle-Size
   League (MSL). In the RoboCup MSL, two teams of five autonomous robots
   play on an 18- x 12-m field. Equipped with sensors and on-board
   computers, each robot should be able to perceive the environment, make
   decision and control itself to play the soccer game autonomously.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents the design of our
   soccer robots, participating in RoboCup MSL. The mechanical platform,
   electrical architecture and software framework are discussed separately.
   The mechanical platform is designed modularly, so easy maintainability
   is achieved; the electronic architecture is built on industrial
   standards using PC-based control technique, which results in high
   robustness and reliability during the intensive and fierce MSL games;
   the software is developed upon the open-source Robot Operating System
   (ROS); thus, the advantages of ROS such as modularity, portability and
   expansibility are inherited.
   Findings - Based on this paper and the open-source hardware and
   software, the MSL robots can be re-developed easily to participate in
   the RoboCup MSL. The robots can also be used in other research and
   education fields, especially for multi-robot systems and distributed
   artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the main designing ideas proposed
   in the paper, i.e. using a modular mechanical structure, an industrial
   electronic system and ROS-based software, provide a common solution for
   designing general intelligent robots.
   Originality/value - The methodology of the intelligent robot design for
   highly competitive and dynamic RoboCup MSL environments is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{An optical fiber gamma ray detector is presented in this work. It is
   based on a Terbium doped Gadolinium Oxysulfide (Gd2O2S:Tb) scintillating
   powder which cover a chemically etched polymer fiber tip. This etching
   improves the fluorescence gathering by the optical fiber. The final
   diameter has been selected to fulfill the trade-off between light
   gathering and mechanical strength. Powder has been encapsulated inside a
   microtube where the fiber tip is immersed. The sensor has been
   irradiated with different air Kerma doses up to 2 Gy/h with a Cs-137
   source, and the spectral distribution of the fluorescence intensity has
   been recorded in a commercial grade CCD spectrometer. The obtained
   signal-to-noise ratio is good enough even for low doses, which has
   allowed to reduce the integration time in the spectrometer. The
   presented results show the feasibility for using low cost equipment to
   detect/measure ionizing radiation as gamma rays are.}},

Abstract = {{We implemented an educational program, based on the use of free software
   and low-cost open hardware, to excite high school students' curiosity
   about seismic-hazard issues and to engage them in the process of
   learning the best practices of seismic safety. This program was
   developed in a senior class at the high school Liceo Paschini in
   Tolmezzo (northeast Italy). The students under the supervision of their
   physics teacher and seismologists, used an Arduino board, ADXL345
   accelerometers, and open-source software to create a low-cost
   seismometer able to record local strong motion. In this article, we
   provide a ``how-to{''} (instructional) guide to enable other students to
   reproduce the experiment. Certain introductory lessons in computer
   sciences and electronics were required for the students to acquire the
   necessary skills and to fill gaps in their background knowledge. In
   addition, lectures by seismologists and specific laboratory activities
   allowed the class to explore different aspects of the physics of
   earthquakes, particularly of the seismic waves, and to become familiar
   with seismic-hazard topics through inquiry-based learning. We believe
   that this exercise is a good example of how earthquake issues can be
   taught through a multidisciplinary approach in subjects traditionally
   covered by scientific and technological disciplines.}},

Abstract = {{Health monitoring is nowadays one of the hottest markets due to the
   increasing interest in prevention and treatment of physical problems. In
   this context the development of wearable, wireless, open-source, and
   nonintrusive sensing solutions is still an open problem. Indeed, most of
   the existing commercial architectures are closed and provide little
   flexibility. In this paper, an open hardware architecture for designing
   a modular wireless sensor node for health monitoring is proposed. By
   separating the connection and sensing functions in two separate boards,
   compliant with the IEEE1451 standard, we add plug and play capabilities
   to analog transducers, while granting at the same time a high level of
   customization. As an additional contribution of the work, we developed a
   cosimulation tool which simplifies the physical connection with the
   hardware devices and provides support for complex systems. Finally, a
   wireless body area network for fall detection and health monitoring,
   based on wireless node prototypes realized according to the proposed
   architecture, is presented as an application scenario.}},

Abstract = {{Soldercubes are a self-reconfiguring modular robot (MR) system whose
   modules are light weight, low cost, and designed with manufacturability
   for large batch production in mind. The frequently cited promises of
   modular robotics-versatility, robustness, and low cost-assume the
   availability of large numbers of modules. However, modules in most MR
   prototypes are large, mechanically complex, expensive, and difficult to
   manufacture. Soldercubes partially overcome this contradiction through
   optimizing some components for volume manufacturing processes. With the
   integration of a soldering connector which weighs only 2 g and has no
   moving parts, Soldercubes are among the cheapest, lightest and smallest
   among comparable self-reconfiguring MR systems. This paper describes the
   Soldercube module design in detail, reports on experiments in a lattice
   configuration, explores non-lattice applications of the system, and
   discusses the effects of utilising volume manufacturing processes in
   module production. All Soldercubes design files are released as open
   source hardware.}},

Abstract = {{This paper summarises progress made towards the radiation hardening of
   LED emergency luminaires for evacuation and emergency response within
   the underground areas of the CERN accelerator complex. The objective has
   been to radiation harden existing Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS)
   emergency luminaires to maximise lighting performance, without
   compromising IEC 60598-2-22 compliance. A systems level approach has
   been adopted, leading to the development of a diode bridge based AC/DC
   power converter. Modified COTS luminaires including this converter
   design have been irradiated (to 100 kGy TID using a Cobalt-60 source),
   with results of a subsequent photometric analysis presented. Following
   encouraging tests results, a reference design for the power converter
   has been released under the CERN Open Hardware License to encourage
   manufacturer adoption. The paper concludes with areas of interest for
   future research in further improving the radiation hardness of LED
   emergency lighting for accelerators with detailed studies at the

Abstract = {{Direct-conversion architectures (DCA) can offer highly integrated
   low-cost hardware solutions to communication transceivers. However, DCA
   devices are sensitive to radio frequency (RF) imperfections such as
   amplifier non-linearities, phase noise and in-phase/quadrature-phase
   imbalances (IQI), which typically lead to a severe degradation of the
   performance of such systems. Motivated by this, we quantify and evaluate
   the impact of RF IQI on wireless communications in the context of
   cascaded fading channels. Novel closed form expressions are derived for
   the corresponding outage probability for the case of ideal transmitter
   (TX) and receiver (RX), ideal TX and I/Q imbalanced RX, I/Q imbalanced
   TX and ideal RX, and joint I/Q imbalanced TX/RX. The offered analytic
   results have a relatively convenient algebraic representation and their
   validity is extensively justified through simulations. Based on these,
   it is shown that cascaded fading leads to considerable degradation in
   the system performance and that assuming ideal RF frontends at the TX
   and RX induces non-negligible errors in the outage probability that can
   exceed 20\% in several communication scenarios. We further demonstrate
   that the effects by cascaded multipath fading conditions are
   particularly severe, as they typically result to considerable
   performance losses of around or over an order of magnitude.}},

Abstract = {{As integrated circuits become increasingly complex, the fabrication
   process renders them more marginal to specification parameters.
   Consequently, these circuits have to be tuned post fabrication to
   compensate for process marginality and thereby optimize their
   performance as well as to improve yields. This process of tuning is
   commonly termed as trimming, wherein the right set of digital trim codes
   is identified and used as a calibration setting by writing these codes
   into the hardware configuration registers. This paper addresses the
   problem of carrying out multi-variable trims involving two or more
   parameters, codes for which must be simultaneously searched and set, in
   order to attain the desired performance of the circuit. A novel low-cost
   hardware implementation of the Simplex minimization algorithm with
   speed-up improvements is described. This implementation is amenable for
   on-chip BIST (built-in self-test) and can also be directly implemented
   as part of the ATE (automatic test equipment) program. Experimental
   results are presented on two industrial circuits. Improvements in terms
   of trim code search time and attaining better performance are shown.}},

Abstract = {{The OpenOrbiter CubeSat Development Initiative is working to build a
   small spacecraft system using open source software and open hardware
   principles. The important design considerations for the CubeSat include
   availability and performance. The essential contribution of this paper
   is the requirement elicitation and specification of system-wide
   qualities such as availability, performance, and security using quality
   attribute scenarios. The effect of using the quality-based scenarios is
   that it allows more rigorous treatment of non-functional requirements
   and hence proper selection of an architecture modeling to satisfy these
   requirements.}},

Abstract = {{Open Hardware and Free Software have both active communities. Open
   source software projects have helped many companies launch their
   products, but that has not happened in the same proportion for hardware.
   Assistive technology industry is known to be extremely restricted to
   proprietary solutions, which may lead to slower development cycles as
   there is a smaller community of device developers. This paper details
   how an Arduino-based open hardware project can be improved to become an
   industrial product with the same quality level of existing available
   devices. The resulting product is scheduled to be released to the public
   this year and will expand the use of power wheelchairs in Brazil so that
   people with disabilities have access to such electronic equipment.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) currently see a strong increase in
   demand for various industrial applications like smart testing and
   production systems. Open frequency bands (e.g. 2.4 GHz) allow the use of
   commercial low-cost hardware, but need to be shared with other devices
   and systems, leading to interference and therefore transmission errors.
   Re-transmitting damaged packages might eventually succeed, but at the
   costs of increased latency and additional energy consumption of the
   node. As minimizing energy consumption is paramount for self-powered WSN
   nodes, interference avoidance is highly desired. In this work a channel
   management procedure for WSNs is proposed which can react to dynamically
   changing interference scenarios. A short monitoring period is used to
   sample received signal strength indication values of a set of candidate
   frequency bands. An extensive measurement campaign is performed and six
   analysis methods are compared, and effects of applying the resulting
   choice of ``best{''} frequency bands to WSNs in an automotive testing
   environment are investigated. The best method allows a reduction of
   energy consumption of a node by about 15\%.}},

Abstract = {{Direct-conversion radio transceivers can offer reprogrammable and
   low-cost hardware solutions for full-duplex (FD) cognitive radio (CR)
   devices. However, they are susceptible to radio frequency (RF)
   impairments, such as in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) imbalance (IQI),
   which can significantly constrain the spectrum sensing capabilities.
   This paper is devoted to quantify and evaluate the effects of IQI in the
   context of spectrum sensing in FD CR systems, in which self-interference
   suppression (SIS) techniques are employed. Specifically, closed form
   expressions are derived for the false alarm and detection probabilities,
   under three different scenarios: imperfect SIS with joint transmitter
   (TX) and receiver (RX) IQI, imperfect SIS and ideal TX/RX RF front-end,
   and perfect SIS and ideal TX/RX RF front-end. The derived analytical
   results are validated through extensive simulations, which reveal that
   IQI has a detrimental impact on the spectrum sensing performance of the
   FD CR transceiver, which brings significant losses in the spectrum
   utilization.}},

Abstract = {{The learning of assistive robotics encompasses concepts from different
   fields, such as control, Kinematic analysis and dynamic analysis. While
   for learning basic robotic concepts nowadays it is very extended the
   usage of microrobots or small commercial robots, it is still complicated
   to find platforms that allow the study of higher performance robotics.
   These platforms are usually expensive and very hard to control, not
   being at reach for most robotic students. This article is focused on the
   development of a prototype for student practices where it is feasible to
   study Kinematic and dynamic robotic aspects, the study and analysis of
   its responses and perform initial control approximations. The platform
   includes low cost hardware and as analysis and control software, MATLAB
   (R) and Simulink (R) are used, which is has wide usage in university
   life. It is intended for last year courses of bachelor and master.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic development of information and communication technologies
   nowadays lead to arising the new solutions in monitoring and sensing
   applications. The most significant solution in that area are Wireless
   Sensor Networks (WSN). These networks consist of a large number of small
   devices, each with different kinds of sensors. Sensor network nodes are
   arranged near or inside the potentially dangerous environment, which may
   cause the damage of the node. However, due to the small size and low
   cost nodes, these networks have a very broad application. The use of the
   WSN is dependent on the type of application used. Typical applications
   for this type of network can be: environmental monitoring, detection and
   tracking of people and vehicles, to detect various types of threats,
   machine monitoring or even health monitoring.
   The ability of the design and implement of the Wireless Sensor Networks
   is very important for today's engineers. The subject of the paper is
   issue related to the way of teaching Wireless Sensor Networks with the

Abstract = {{This paper describes an open source hardware and software platform
   devised specifically to allow high school and undergraduate instructors
   to prepare new laboratory demonstrations and projects for kinematics and
   dynamics in an easy, affordable and extensible way. The platform
   consists of a computing portable station with static sensors and a
   microcontroller based mobile device small sensors embedded. The whole
   platform rely heavily on wireless technologies so the students could
   operate the platform with their own tablets or smartphones.
   To meet the open source requirements, all the components comply with
   open source restrictions and also the design documents and the source
   code are made publicly available to the education community. Therefore,
   there is not only an economical sensing alternative to current
   configurations of laboratories but an extensible system in which new
   requirements and sensors could be added covering new areas such as
   electronics, magnetism and thermodynamics. A user friendly web client
   permits the students to configure and perform measurements using an
   Internet connected smartphone or any portable computing device in a way
   that makes possible to the instructor to broaden the type and intensity
   of experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Robot development could benefit from reuse of hardware and software
   components. One of the most successful example is the Robot Operating
   System (ROS), which aims at supporting robot development and research in
   robotics by providing a modular and general purpose software framework;
   yet, at a lower level, i.e., mechanics, electronics, and firmware,
   component-based robotics is still in its early stages. Moreover, basic
   functionalities, such as robust odometry and pose tracking, seem to be
   solved on an ad-hoc basis, while no generic solution can be plugged in a
   system as an off-the-shelf component. This paper presents two modular
   tools for the development of robotics applications and how these can be
   deployed on different robot platforms as off-the-shelf, open hardware
   and open software, components at the hardware, firmware, and core
   software levels. A case study based on two mobile platforms is described
   showing how it is possible to reuse physical components in the building
   of a mobile robot and provide an off-the-shelf architecture which sports
   multi-sensor fusion for robust odometry and pose tracking, requiring a
   fraction of the effort with respect to ad hoc techniques.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents Dimitri, an open-software \& open-hardware robot

   advanced research on human-robot interaction, force-aware object
   manipulation and environment exploration. The robot has 13 DOFs: 4 DOFs
   with series elastic actuators in each arm, 3 DOFs for roll, pitch and
   yaw of the waist, and 2 DOFs for head pan and tilt. Our main innovation
   is in the employment of a polyurethane based compliant spring system
   attached to conventional robotics servo motors, turning them into
   low-cost series elastic actuators (SEAs). To demonstrate the robot's
   capabilities in the context of cognitive robotics research and
   goal-directed behavior, we successfully employed a multiple timescale
   recurrent neural network (MTRNN), enabling the robot to reproduce
   combined prototypical movement patterns previously trained via
   interactive demonstration.}},

Abstract = {{Selective openness allows a firm to sell a systemic innovation that
   combines both open and proprietary technologies. Such firm strategies
   are now common for open source software and other information goods.
   However, they pose conceptual and practical uncertainties for
   hardware-focused companies, particularly as research on open hardware
   has emphasized community rather than firm success. Here we study firm
   openness in 3D printing, with a case study of how MakerBot Industries
   leveraged external communities and selective openness become the
   consumer market leader. After reviewing the literature on systemic
   innovation and selective openness, we document the proprietary
   strategies of a dozen startup companies during the first two decades of
   the 3D printing industry. We contrast this to the open hardware,
   software and content strategy that MakerBot's founders used to enter and
   grow the consumer market from 2009 onward. We show how MakerBot shifted
   to a selectively open, systemic innovation strategy that complemented
   proprietary hardware and software with open user-generated content from
   its Thingiverse online community. From this, we suggest the inherent
   complementarity of selective openness strategies between open and
   proprietary components, and conclude with predictions as to when and how
   a startup or incumbent firm will combine open and proprietary elements.

Title = {{Transient switching control strategy from regenerative braking to
   anti-lock braking with a semi-brake-by-wire system}},
Journal = {{VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{231-257}},
Abstract = {{Regenerative braking is an important technology in improving fuel
   economy of an electric vehicle (EV). However, additional motor braking
   will change the dynamic characteristics of the vehicle, leading to
   braking instability, especially when the anti-lock braking system (ABS)
   is triggered. In this paper, a novel semi-brake-by-wire system, without
   the use of a pedal simulator and fail-safe device, is proposed. In order
   to compensate for the hysteretic characteristics of the designed brake
   system while ensure braking reliability and fuel economy when the ABS is
   triggered, a novel switching compensation control strategy using sliding
   mode control is brought forward. The proposed strategy converts the
   complex coupling braking process into independent control of hydraulic
   braking and regenerative braking, through which a balance between
   braking performance, braking reliability, braking safety and fuel
   economy is achieved. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy
   is effective and adaptable in different road conditions while the large
   wheel slip rate is triggered during a regenerative braking course. The
   research provides a new possibility of low-cost equipment and better
   control performance for the regenerative braking in the EV and the
   hybrid EV.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a computer-aided tool for automatically generating
   Labanotation scores from motion capture data named GenLaban. GenLaban
   can be implemented with a low-cost equipment but an efficient method
   that allows users converting body motions to scores. The key components
   of GenLaban are the analysis of body motions, the quantization of body
   postures and the determination of body parts carrying the body weight.
   All the processes are under supervision of a Labanotation expert to
   ensure the notation meaning correctly as the use for the dance
   composition. The experiments showed that for dancers, dance instructors
   and choreographers, GenLaban is a potential tool for notating dance
   movements into Labanotation scores enabling them to be accurately
   interpreted. At present the system can handle a subset of Labanotation
   covering many of the fundamental movements. However, Labanotation is
   rich in symbols and new symbols are continually being introduced and
   will be incorporated in the GenLaban tool as time permits.}},

Title = {{Applying compressive sensing to TEM video: a substantial frame rate
   increase on any camera}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED STRUCTURAL AND CHEMICAL IMAGING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{One of the main limitations of imaging at high spatial and temporal
   resolution during in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
   experiments is the frame rate of the camera being used to image the
   dynamic process. While the recent development of direct detectors has
   provided the hardware to achieve frame rates approaching 0.1 ms, the
   cameras are expensive and must replace existing detectors. In this
   paper, we examine the use of coded aperture compressive sensing (CS)
   methods to increase the frame rate of any camera with simple, low-cost
   hardware modifications. The coded aperture approach allows multiple
   sub-frames to be coded and integrated into a single camera frame during
   the acquisition process, and then extracted upon readout using
   statistical CS inversion. Here we describe the background of CS and
   statistical methods in depth and simulate the frame rates and
   efficiencies for in-situ TEM experiments. Depending on the resolution
   and signal/noise of the image, it should be possible to increase the
   speed of any camera by more than an order of magnitude using this
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{This study provides an in-depth investigation into low-cost and no-cost
   substrate release mechanisms that allow gas metal arc weld 3-D printed
   ER4043 aluminum and ER70S-6 steel parts to be removed from a reusable
   print substrate with minimal energy. Aluminum oxide, boron nitride, and
   titanium nitride coatings were evaluated as possible substrate release
   agents for aluminum printing. Additionally, the in situ formation of
   substrate release agents such as intermetallics and oxides were tested
   for both aluminum and steel printing. Testing was performed with a
   modified Charpy impact tester to remove 3D printed metal parts from an
   1100 aluminum or A36 low carbon steel print substrate to assess the
   impact energy required for removal. Specimen porosity was measured prior
   to sectioning and microstructural analysis, hardness traverses were
   measured across the specimens, and the elastic and shear moduli of the
   parts were analyzed via ultrasonic methods. All of the employed
   substrate release mechanisms minimized weld penetration and, in some
   instances, formed a brittle phase with the print substrate that allowed
   the specimens to be removed with minimal impact energy. These results
   thus provide methods with the removal of metal 3-D printed parts from
   print substrates with no specialized tooling or equipment conducive to
   distributed manufacturing. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To provide process optimization of metal fabricating self-replicating
   rapid prototyper (RepRap) 3-D printers requires a low-cost sensor and
   data logger system to measure current (I) and voltage (V) of the gas
   metal arc welders (GMAW). This paper builds on previous open-source
   hardware development to provide a real-time measurement of welder I-V
   where the measuring circuit is connected to two analog inputs of the
   Arduino that is used to control the 3-D printer itself. Franklin
   firmware accessed through a web interface that is used to control the
   printer allows storing the measured values and downloading those stored
   readings to the user's computer. To test this custom current and voltage
   monitoring device this study reports on its use on an upgraded all metal
   RepRap during the printing of aluminum alloy (ER1100, ER4043, ER4943,
   ER4047, and ER5356). The voltage and current data were analyzed on a per

Abstract = {{We present a robotic platform based on the open source RepRap 3D printer
   that can print and maintain chemical artificial life in the form of a
   dynamic, chemical droplet. The robot uses computer vision, a
   self-organizing map, and a learning program to automatically categorize
   the behavior of the droplet that it creates. The robot can then use this
   categorization to autonomously detect the current state of the droplet
   and respond. The robot is programmed to visually track the droplet and
   either inject more chemical fuel to sustain a motile state or introduce
   a new chemical component that results in a state change (e.g.,
   division). Coupling inexpensive open source hardware with sensing and
   feedback allows for replicable real-time manipulation and monitoring of
   nonequilibrium systems that would be otherwise tedious, expensive, and
   error-prone. This system is a first step towards the practical
   confluence of chemical, artificial intelligence, and robotic approaches

Abstract = {{Electronic systems are not widely used for measuring biological
   variables in beehives despite the importance that honeybees have for
   both the environment and humans. A better understanding of bee colonies
   is needed in order to prevent certain dangers that threaten the bee
   population. In this study, we have developed an electronic system based
   on the Arduino Open Hardware platform, to which we have added
   temperature and humidity sensors to adapt the system to the particular
   conditions of beehive management. The system has been used to record
   changes in temperature and humidity inside hives and assess bees'
   thermoregulation adaptability within colonies in hives with
   opened-screened bottom boards; an interesting management tool for
   controlling the harmful Varroa destructor mite as compared to beehives
   with conventional closed bottom boards. The results revealed that bee
   colonies were able to thermoregulate in hives with open anti-Varroa
   bottom boards to the same degree as those in conventional bottom board
   hives even under winter conditions in a mediterranean climate, thus
   indicating that there are no additional risks associated with the use of
   open-screened bottom board models. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The article describes the design phase, development and practical
   application of a low-cost control system for a forced circulation solar
   plant in an outdoor test cell located near Milan. Such a system provides
   for the use of an electric pump for the circulation of heat transfer

   running plant temperatures are the fundamental parameter to evaluate the
   system performance such as proper operation, and the control and

   energy-powered wireless-based smart object was developed, able to
   monitor the running temperatures of a solar thermal system and aimed at
   moving beyond standard monitoring approaches to achieve a low-cost and
   customizable device, even in terms of installation in different
   environmental conditions. To this end, two types of communications were
   used: the first is a low-cost communication based on the ZigBee protocol
   used for control purposes, so that it can be customized according to
   specific needs, while the second is based on a Bluetooth protocol used

Abstract = {{An optimization method of error detection and correction (EDAC) circuit
   design is proposed. The method involves selecting or constructing EDAC
   codes of low cost hardware, associated with operation scheduling
   implementation based on 2-input XOR gates structure, and two actions for
   reducing hardware cells, which can reduce the delay penalties and area
   costs of the EDAC circuit effectively. The 32-bit EDAC circuit hardware
   implementation is selected to make a prototype, based on the 180 nm
   process. The delay penalties and area costs of the EDAC circuit are
   evaluated. Results show that the time penalty and area cost of the EDAC
   circuitries are affected with different parity-check matrices and
   different hardware implementation for the EDAC codes with the same
   capability of correction and detection code. This method can be used as
   a guide for low-cost radiation-hardened microprocessor EDAC circuit
   design and for more advanced technologies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a flexible Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) actuator
   designed to increase the limited displacement that these alloys can
   induce. The SMA actuator has been designed so that it can be bent up to
   about 180, providing more freedom of movements and a better integration
   in wearable robots, specially in soft wearable robots, than standard
   rigid solutions. Although the actuator length is relatively short, this
   original design allows a great linear displacement, because it can have
   one or more loops of the same SMA wire inside the actuator. This implies
   that the length of the SMA wire is at least two times greater than the
   length of the actuator. The adopted strategy for both position and speed
   control that overcomes the hysteresis and prevents overheating the
   actuator is also described. The control algorithm has been implemented
   in a rapid control prototyping (RCP) system based on a low cost hardware
   platform. Finally, the application of this novel actuator in a wrist
   exoskeleton prototype is shown to demonstrate the feasibility of using
   the flexible SMA actuator in a real soft wearable robot. (C) 2014

   capacity for 1140 plants, which pass daily through stations to record
   fluorescence, near-infrared, and visible images. Plant Computer Vision
   (PlantCV) was developed as open-source, hardware platform-independent
   software for quantitative image analysis. In a 4-week experiment, wild
   Setaria viridis and domesticated Setaria italica had fundamentally
   different temporal responses to water availability. While both lines
   produced similar levels of biomass under limited water conditions,
   Setaria viridis maintained the same water-use efficiency under water
   replete conditions, while Setaria italica shifted to less efficient
   growth. Overall, the Bellwether Phenotyping Platform and PlantCV
   software detected significant effects of genotype and environment on
   height, biomass, water-use efficiency, color, plant architecture, and
   tissue water status traits. All similar to 79 000 images acquired during

Abstract = {{Most experimental fields of science and engineering require the use of
   data acquisition systems (DAQ), devices in charge of sampling and
   converting electrical signals into digital data and, typically,
   performing all of the required signal preconditioning. Since commercial
   DAQ systems are normally focused on specific types of sensors and
   actuators, systems engineers may need to employ mutually-incompatible
   hardware from different manufacturers in applications demanding
   heterogeneous inputs and outputs, such as small-signal analog inputs,
   differential quadrature rotatory encoders or variable current outputs. A
   common undesirable side effect of heterogeneous DAQ hardware is the lack
   of an accurate synchronization between samples captured by each device.
   To solve such a problem with low-cost hardware, we present a novel
   modular DAQ architecture comprising a base board and a set of
   interchangeable modules. Our main design goal is the ability to sample
   all sources at predictable, fixed sampling frequencies, with a reduced
   synchronization mismatch (<1 s) between heterogeneous signal sources. We
   present experiments in the field of mechanical engineering, illustrating
   vibration spectrum analyses from piezoelectric accelerometers and, as a
   novelty in these kinds of experiments, the spectrum of quadrature
   encoder signals. Part of the design and software will be publicly
   released online.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a completely randomizable flow-through outdoor mesocosm for
   climate change and ecotoxicology studies that was built with inexpensive
   materials. The 16 raceway tanks allow up to 6x water renewal per hour,
   avoiding changes in natural abiotic seawater conditions. We use an
   open-source hardware board (Arduino) that was adapted to control heaters
   and an innovative CO2 injection system. This system reduced seawater pH
   up to -0.9 units and increased temperature up to +6 degrees C in three
   treatments and a control. Treatments can be continuously compared with
   the control and vary according to diel fluctuations, thus following the
   diel range observed in the sea. The mesocosm facility also includes an
   integrated secondary system of 48 aquaria for ecotoxicology studies. We
   validated the reproducibility and relevance of our experimental system
   by analyzing the variation of the total DNA of the microbial community
   extracted from corals in three elevated temperature scenarios during a
   40-day experiment. We also present data from temperature, acidification,
   and copper contamination trials, which allowed continuous, reliable, and
   consistent treatment manipulations.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate the additive manufacturing of complex three-dimensional

   printing of hydrated materials with an elastic modulus <500 kPa
   including alginate, collagen, and fibrin. Computer-aided design models
   of 3D optical, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging data
   were 3D printed at a resolution of similar to 200 mm and at low cost by
   leveraging open-source hardware and software tools. Proof-of-concept

   fusing this information, the system can infer the behaviour of the
   driver, providing aggressive behaviour detection. By means of accurate
   GPS-based localization, the system is able to add context information,
   such as digital map information, speed limits, etc. Several parameters
   and signals are taken into account, both in the temporal and frequency
   domains, to provide real time behaviour detection. The system was tested

   technology and consumer electronics. Open source hardware, which is the
   free exchange of a product's design information, is gaining popularity

   open source movement to space technology. In the focus of our discussion
   are CubeSats, considered as an ideal playground for the introduction of
   technological and methodological novelties. We examine the legal
   background of open source designs and contrast the advantages of open
   source products for developers and users against closed source products.
   We then present an open source initiative for CubeSat technologies with

Abstract = {{Target detection is an important issue in the unattended ground sensors.
   In this paper, inspired by the idea of subspace-based direction of
   arrival estimation algorithms, a new target detection algorithm called
   subspace-based target detection (SBTD) is proposed to detect moving
   targets. The SBTD employs the SNR of the acoustic signals to decide
   whether moving targets are exiting or not. Although the SBTD has good
   detection performance, its cost maybe a little high for unattended
   sensors with low-cost hardware and long-term monitoring. To relieve the
   cost, we propose the hierarchical detection scheme and develop a
   two-stage detection method based on the SBTD for target detection in the
   wild, in which the first stage detection algorithm is chosen from
   current detection algorithms, while the second stage detection algorithm
   employs the SBTD. Experiments are conducted to verify the proposed
   detection method through acoustic signals gathered by the
   micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) microphone array in the wild.
   Results show that the detector constructed by our two-stage detection
   method cannot only estimate the SNR of the acoustic signals but also can
   reduce the false alarm rate significantly with the detection rate almost
   unchanged in comparison with the detector chosen by its first-stage
   detection algorithm. The results indicate that a better detection
   performance is achieved in terms of the receiver operator characteristic
   curves.}},

Abstract = {{High-accuracy implementation of biological neural networks (NN) is a
   task with high computational overheads, especially in the case of
   large-scale realizations of neuromorphic algorithms. This paper presents
   a set of piecewise linear FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) models, which can
   reproduce different behaviors, similar to the biological neuron. This
   paper presents a set of equations as a model to describe the mechanisms
   of a single neuron, which are implementable on digital platforms.
   Simulation results show that the model can reproduce different behaviors
   of the neuron. The proposed models are investigated, in terms of digital
   implementation feasibility and computational overhead, targeting
   low-cost hardware realization. Hardware synthesis and physical
   implementations on FPGA show that the proposed models can produce a

Abstract = {{Introduction: Emergency physicians are among the few specialists besides
   ophthalmologists who commonly perform ophthalmologic examinations using
   the slit lamp and other instruments. However, most medical schools in
   the United States do not require an ophthalmology rotation upon
   completion. Teaching procedural skills to medical students can be
   challenging due to limited resources and instructor availability. Our
   study assesses the effectiveness of a 40-minute hands-on teaching
   session on ophthalmologic examination for medical students using only
   two instructors and low-cost equipment.
   Methods: We performed an interventional study using a convenience sample
   of subjects. Pre-and post-workshop questionnaires on students'
   confidence in performing ophthalmologic examination were administered.
   We used a paired t-test and Wilcoxon rank test to analyze the data.
   Results: Of the 30 participants in the study, the mean age was 25 and
   the majority were first-year medical students. The students' confidence
   in performing every portion of the ophthalmologic exam increased
   significantly after the teaching session. We found that the average
   confidence level before the teaching session were below 2 on a 1-5
   Likert scale (1 being the least confident). Confidence levels in using
   the slit lamp had the highest improvement among the skills taught (2.17
   95\% CI {[}1.84-2.49]). Students reported the least improvement in their
   confidence in assessing extraocular movements (0.73, 95\% CI
   {[}0.30-1.71]) and examining pupillary function (0.73, 95\% CI
   {[}0.42-1.04]). We observed the biggest difference in median confidence
   level in the use of the tonometer (4 with a p-value of < 0.05).
   Conclusion: A 40-minute structured hands-on training session can
   significantly improve students' confidence levels in ophthalmologic
   skills.}},

Abstract = {{Precision agriculture combines the use of information and technology to
   ensure the best agricultural practices. Obtaining real-time non-invasive
   information to monitor crops or make yield predictions is a challenge.
   An approach is to use crop yield models in combination with real-time
   data used as input in such models. It was demonstrated that it is
   possible to design an accurate system using open source hardware and
   open systems to record the input for these models and monitor crops. The
   system presented has two main components: a device that records
   environmental parameters and a smartphone application (software) that
   links this device to a data server in order to process and analyse the
   information. The solution is scalable in terms of the type of sensors
   used (i.e. temperature and relative humidity of the air or soil), the
   rate of information retrieval and so on, so it can be used in various
   scenarios, including environmental or land policy monitoring. Moreover,
   this open source hardware can be used by a broad variety of users and is
   an alternative in poor rural areas because of its low cost compared to
   other solutions. It can enable increased agricultural production and
   management of the local environment, bringing new agricultural practices
   to these areas. Furthermore, progress in the use of this type of
   technology can help to develop new capabilities for growers. Results of
   calibration tests and measurements to demonstrate the usefulness of this
   system in precision agriculture are presented. (C) 2015 IAgrE. Published

Abstract = {{An embedded model predictive controller (eMPC) based on the linear MPC
   module in Statoil Estimation and Prediction Tool for Identification and
   Control has been developed, and it is intended to facilitate the MPC
   application on embedded hardware. The control design approach
   illustrates a viable way of migrating from an industrial PC-based MPC
   technology to an embedded platform. This work also provides the
   transformations and the real-time considerations necessary to achieve a
   functional high-performance predictive controller on a low-cost embedded
   hardware, with limited computational resources. The eMPC was implemented
   for rapid prototyping on the Ethernut 5 open-source hardware, and its
   performance was tested for a simulated process. The concept was tested
   using a real MPC application developed for a prototype of a new
   industrial process that requires an advanced embedded multivariable,
   constraint handling control solution. The results confirm the viability
   of the embedded MPC design approach. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \&

   start-ups, maker culture is envisioned as an enabler of the next

   politicians, and scholars of the global tech industryrests on taking
   seriously the technological and cultural fabrics of professional making
   outside familiar information technology innovation hubs like Silicon
   Valley: making-do, mass production, and reuse. I trace back to China's
   first hackerspace, documenting how a collective of makers began to move
   away from appropriating Western concepts of openness toward promoting
   China as source for knowledge, creativity, and innovation. This article
   demonstrates that when China's makers set up open hardware businesses
   and articulate a unique culture of hacking with Chinese characteristics,
   they draw boundaries between the professional making they saw embodied
   in Chinese industrial production and the hobbyist making embodied in
   Western histories and cultures of hacking. In so doing, they position
   China as site of both technological and cultural expertise, intervening
   in dominant conceptions of computing that split manufacturing and

Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is an effective technique
   for diagnosing the behaviour of electrochemical devices such as
   batteries and fuel cells, usually by fitting data to an equivalent
   circuit model (ECM). The common approach in the laboratory is to measure
   the impedance spectrum of a cell in the frequency domain using a single
   sine sweep signal, then fit the ECM parameters in the frequency domain.
   This paper focuses instead on estimation of the ECM parameters directly
   from time-domain data. This may be advantageous for parameter estimation
   in practical applications such as automotive systems including
   battery-powered vehicles, where the data may be heavily corrupted by
   noise. The proposed methodology is based on the simplified refined
   instrumental variable for continuous-time fractional systems method
   ('srivcf'), provided by the Crone toolbox {[}1,2], combined with
   gradient-based optimisation to estimate the order of the fractional term
   in the ECM. The approach was tested first on synthetic data and then on
   real data measured from a 26650 lithium-ion iron phosphate cell with
   low-cost equipment. The resulting Nyquist plots from the time-domain
   fitted models match the impedance spectrum closely (much more accurately
   than when a Randles model is assumed), and the fitted parameters as
   separately determined through a laboratory potentiostat with frequency
   domain fitting match to within 13\%. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Nitrate, the most oxidized form of nitrogen, is regulated to protect
   people and animals from harmful levels as there is a large over
   abundance due to anthropogenic factors. Widespread field testing for
   nitrate could begin to address the nitrate pollution problem, however,
   the Cadmium Reduction Method, the leading certified method to detect and
   quantify nitrate, demands the use of a toxic heavy metal. An
   alternative, the recently proposed Environmental Protection Agency
   Nitrate Reductase Nitrate-Nitrogen Analysis Method, eliminates this
   problem but requires an expensive proprietary spectrophotometer. The
   development of an inexpensive portable, handheld photometer will greatly
   expedite field nitrate analysis to combat pollution. To accomplish this
   goal, a methodology for the design, development, and technical
   validation of an improved open-source water testing platform capable of
   performing Nitrate Reductase Nitrate-Nitrogen Analysis Method. This
   approach is evaluated for its potential to i) eliminate the need for
   toxic chemicals in water testing for nitrate and nitrite, ii) reduce the
   cost of equipment to perform this method for measurement for water
   quality, and iii) make the method easier to carryout in the field. The
   device is able to perform as well as commercial proprietary systems for
   less than 15\% of the cost for materials. This allows for greater access

Abstract = {{We present a novel approach to developing a vehicle communication
   platform consisting of a low-cost, open-source hardware for moving
   vehicle data to a secure server, a Web Application Programming Interface
   (API) for the provision of third-party services, and an intuitive user
   dashboard for access control and service distribution. The CloudThink
   infrastructure promotes the commoditization of vehicle telematics data
   by facilitating easier, flexible, and more secure access. It enables
   drivers to confidently share their vehicle information across multiple
   applications to improve the transportation experience for all
   stakeholders, as well as to potentially monetize their data. The
   foundations for an application ecosystem have been developed which,
   taken together with the fair value for driving data and low barriers to
   entry, will drive adoption of CloudThink as the standard method for
   projecting physical vehicles into the cloud. The application space
   initially consists of a few fundamental and important applications
   (vehicle tethering and remote diagnostics, road-safety monitoring, and
   fuel economy analysis) but as CloudThink begins to gain widespread
   adoption, the multiplexing of applications on the same data structure
   and set will accelerate its adoption.}},

   sensors and hidden Markov tree model}},
Journal = {{OPTICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Linear pyroelectric array sensors have enabled useful classifications of
   objects such as humans and animals to be performed with relatively
   low-cost hardware in border and perimeter security applications. Ongoing
   research has sought to improve the performance of these sensors through
   signal processing algorithms. In the research presented here, we
   introduce the use of hidden Markov tree (HMT) models for object
   recognition in images generated by linear pyroelectric sensors. HMTs are
   trained to statistically model the wavelet features of individual
   objects through an expectation-maximization learning process. Human
   versus animal classification for a test object is made by evaluating its
   wavelet features against the trained HMTs using the maximum-likelihood
   criterion. The classification performance of this approach is compared
   to two other techniques; a texture, shape, and spectral component
   features (TSSF) based classifier and a speeded-up robust feature (SURF)
   classifier. The evaluation indicates that among the three techniques,
   the wavelet-based HMT model works well, is robust, and has improved
   classification performance compared to a SURF-based algorithm in
   equivalent computation time. When compared to the TSSF-based classifier,
   the HMT model has a slightly degraded performance but almost an order of
   magnitude improvement in computation time enabling real-time
   implementation. (C) 2015 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation

Abstract = {{Conventional detection of Salmonella from foods involves enrichment and
   isolation on selective media which can significantly lengthen time to
   result. The objective of this study was to evaluate the utility of an
   accelerated plating procedure and the use of rapid screening devices for
   Salmonella detection. Fresh produce was inoculated with Salmonella at
   similar to 25, similar to 75 and similar to 25CFUsample(-1). After 24h
   pre-enrichment, subcultures were made into TT and RV broths and further
   incubated at 42 degrees C for an additional 7 and 24h. Enrichments were
   streaked for isolation of Salmonella as well as tested by rapid
   screening methods. The 7-h accelerated plating procedure worked well
   from 4/6 to 6/6 in all produce samples inoculated at the lowest level.
   Both the RapidChek and Neogen Reveal tests worked as well as the
   VIDAS-SLM after 24h secondary enrichment, but failed to detect the
   pathogen after 7h selective enrichment in romaine lettuce and tomatoes,
   while fractional detection was observed in cilantro and jalapenos. Both
   devices detected Salmonella on cantaloupe at the lowest level of
   inoculation. An abbreviated selective enrichment procedure worked well
   to accelerate the isolation of colonies of Salmonella from contaminated
   samples providing isolates for further characterization 1day earlier
   than standard analysis.
   Significance and Impact of the StudyIn the event of a foodborne disease
   outbreak, rapid identification and characterization of the pathogen is
   essential to prevent the spread of disease and reduce the number of
   illnesses. This study reports the utility of an abbreviated secondary
   enrichment for the isolation of Salmonella in artificially contaminated
   fresh produce at very low levels. In addition, incorporation of rapid,
   easy-to-use lateral flow devices to screen enrichments can provide a low
   cost (equipment and highly trained personnel), high return (rapid
   identification of contaminated food) investment in the timely pathogen
   screening of fresh produce.

Abstract = {{Hand position and gesture recognition from a series of images is a topic
   of relevance for the development of human-machine interaction. The

   literature on hand position and gesture recognition with the use of
   depth cameras. Most studies noticeably focus on the recognition of
   one-handed gestures and their classification within a pre-established
   set of gestures. Only in research from recent years does one see
   significant advances in the identification of unconstrained hand poses,
   that is, inference from the skeleton with the use of depth and color
   information. Nevertheless, the lack of a standardized set of tests and
   the diversity of hardware leaves unclear the extent to which these would
   prove effective with low-cost hardware.}},

Abstract = {{The new open-source quadrotor platform called X4-MaG presented here was
   developed for academic and research applications. X4-MaG is a small,
   low-cost open quadrotor of only 307-grammes which offers two levels of
   controllers providing a manual mode and an automatic mode thanks to
   powerful Linux-based controller embedded onboard. The experiments
   presented here show the reliability of the open hardware and software
   embedded onboard the quadrotor. To estimate the robot s attitude, a
   quaternion-based complementary filter requiring very few computational
   resources was developed and implemented on an 8-bit Arduino board. It
   was also established that the stabilization feedback system based on
   quaternions tracks the attitude setpoints with precision up to twice
   greater than a classical cascaded PI controller. The controllers and
   estimators were designed in the Matlab/Simulink environment and directly
   implemented onboard the tiny Linux-based autopilot board using a custom
   made toolbox (RT-MaG toolbox). The autopilot was tested in the brand-new
   Marseilles Flying Arena with various 3-D flight trajectories and found
   to be highly accurate with errors of only 0.7cm in hover and less than
   3.2cm at 1.2m.s(-1). The X4-MaG quadrotor was able to reach speeds
   greater than 2m.s(-1) and reject attitude disturbances of 20' within
   0.8s.}},

Abstract = {{Microtremor survey is a kind of passive-source methods which uses
   ambient ground tremors for geological investigation. Compared with
   traditional geophysical methods, it is more flexible, cost-efficient,
   and environmentally friendly. Most currently used geophones are
   expensive and bulky, and therefore inconvenient to large-scale
   deployment. In this study, a no-cable low-cost geophone was optimized to
   suit for large-scale microtremor survey.
   The method of optimization is based on the following four points: First,
   it selects a sensor through the analysis of the self-noise of to meet
   the needs of microtremor survey. Second, it chooses the right
   operational amplifier and AD conversion module. Third, it integrates
   design of the entire system without using external module. And fourth,
   it makes a low-cost design of the geophone system, including selection
   of low-cost hardware components and reducing the amount of software
   code. Finally, the optimized geophone was used in three areas with
   different geological conditions in order to verify the rationality of
   the improvement and the possibilities for large-scale microtremor
   survey.
   The purpose of optimization has been achieved in this research. The
   no-cable geophone wrights only 600 g, and the maximum average power cost
   does not exceed 0. 1 mW. The entire system costs less than 2000 RMB. The
   most important thing is the optimized geophone can record the
   microtremor signal from O. 5 to 20 Hz effectively. Experiments show that
   in different geological conditions the geophone can be setup quickly and
   work smoothly and reliably. The results of microtremor survey
   experiments are consistent with the existing geological data.
   Because the new geophone is much cheaper than the existing microtremor
   survey equipment, it is possible to use it in low-cost large-scale
   survey. The optimized geophone has a very small volume and light weight,
   and can be rapidly emplacedinto a variety of detector arrays. After the
   emplacement of large number of geophones, it can easily and quickly
   conduct survey to two-dimensional or three-dimensional velocity
   structure of the area. Such microtremor survey with environment-friendly
   and low-cost advantages has broad application prospects.}},

Abstract = {{One often-overlooked factor when selecting a platform for large-scale
   electrophysiology is whether or not a particular data acquisition system
   is `open' or `closed': that is, whether or not the system's schematics
   and source code are available to end users. Open systems have a
   reputation for being difficult to acquire, poorly documented, and hard
   to maintain. With the arrival of more powerful and compact integrated
   circuits, rapid prototyping services, and web-based tools for
   collaborative development, these stereotypes must be reconsidered. We
   discuss some of the reasons why multichannel extracellular
   electrophysiology could benefit from open-source approaches and describe
   examples of successful community-driven tool development within this
   field. In order to promote the adoption of open-source hardware and to
   reduce the need for redundant development efforts, we advocate a move
   toward standardized interfaces that connect each element of the data
   processing pipeline. This will give researchers the flexibility to
   modify their tools when necessary, while allowing them to continue to
   benefit from the high-quality products and expertise provided by
   commercial vendors.}},

Volume = {{66}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Recent neurophysiologic findings have shown that astrocytes play
   important roles in information processing and modulation of neuronal
   activity. Motivated by these findings, in the present research, a
   digital neuromorphic circuit to study neuron astrocyte interaction is
   proposed. In this digital circuit, the firing dynamics of the neuron is
   described by Izhikevich model and the calcium dynamics of a single
   astrocyte is explained by a functional model introduced by Postnov and
   colleagues. For digital implementation of the neuron astrocyte
   signaling, Single Constant Multiply (SCM) technique and several linear
   approximations are used for efficient low-cost hardware implementation
   on digital platforms. Using the proposed neuron astrocyte circuit and
   based on the results of MATLAB simulations, hardware synthesis and FPGA
   implementation, it is demonstrated that the proposed digital astrocyte
   is able to change the firing patterns of the neuron through
   bidirectional communication. Utilizing the proposed digital circuit, it
   will be illustrated that information processing in synaptic clefts is
   strongly regulated by astrocyte. Moreover, our results suggest that the
   digital circuit of neuron astrocyte crosstalk produces diverse neural
   responses and therefore enhances the information processing capabilities
   of the neuromorphic circuits. This is suitable for applications in
   reconfigurable neuromorphic devices which implement biologically brain
   circuits. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Sustainability has become a major concern in many countries and is
   leading to strict regulations regarding the impact of products and
   services during their manufacturing, use, and disposal. Power
   consumption monitoring in manufacturing companies can lead to a
   reduction of machine tools energy wastes and consequently to lower
   expenses. To this end, a complete transparency of energy usage among the
   entire manufacturing facilities is required. Despite the small volume of
   material processed, micro manufacturing processes are energy intensive
   and the optimization of energy usage becomes critical for manufacturing
   sustainability. Electrical discharge machining (EDM) is considered an
   attractive solution for the manufacturing of microcomponents. In this
   paper, a low cost and modular data acquisition system, based on
   open-hardware and open-source software, for online energy consumption
   monitoring, is presented. The system described is applied for energy
   efficiency analysis of the micro EDM milling process by using a state of
   the art commercial machine tool. A number of sensors is connected to the
   data acquisition system to measure the energy consumption of the main
   sub-systems of the machine tool, data is recorded through a
   microcontroller, and sent to the main computer via Wi-Fi for data
   storage and analysis. Results show that the process efficiency depends
   on machine parameters but it is always far below 0.01 \%. Solutions are
   suggested to improve the energy efficiency of the machine tool
   considered in this work.}},

   manufacturing to the classroom}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VISUAL LANGUAGES AND COMPUTING}},

Abstract = {{Objective: 3-D printing technologies have the potential to improve both
   Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education and
   Career and Technical Education (CTE), as well as integrating these two
   educational emphases and providing opportunities for cross-curriculum
   engagement. The objective of this study is to investigate the potential
   of open-source (OS) technologies in an educational setting, given the
   combination of economic constraints affecting all educational
   environments and the ability of OS design to profoundly decrease the
   cost of technological tools and technological innovation.
   Methods: This paper reports on a 3-day workshop augmented with online
   instructional and visual tools designed for middle school and high
   school level educators from a wide array of disciplines (including
   traditional science, math, and engineering as well as computer, shop,
   and art). Teachers (n=22) submitted applications to participate in the
   workshop, the workshop was observed for both evaluation and research,
   teachers participated in focus groups (n=2) during the workshop in order
   to discuss their interest in OS 3-D printing technology and its
   potential role in their classrooms, and teachers completed a voluntary
   post-workshop survey and responded to follow-up after printers were in
   the classroom for one year.
   Results: During the workshop teachers built 3-D printers using OS
   technologies that they were then able to take back to their schools and
   into their classrooms.
   Conclusion: Through workshops augmented with online instructional and
   visual tools designed to provide facilitated yet self-directed
   engagement with a new, relatively unknown, and relatively complex
   technology, paired teacher teams were able to successfully build and use
   RepRap 3-D printers based on OS design in just three days. Practice:
   Here, we discuss both what the teachers learned and what we learned from
   the teachers regarding the potential for educators to construct OS 3-D
   printing technologies as a tool of empowering and transformative
   education.
   Implications: Open-source 3-D printing technologies have the potential
   to improve education through a sense of empowerment resulting from
   active participation, as well as through cross-curriculum engagement.

Abstract = {{The Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) refers to the quality of the
   environment in relation to the health and well-being of the occupants.
   It is a holistic concept, which considers several categories, each
   related to a specific environmental parameter. This article describes a
   low-cost and open-source hardware architecture able to detect the indoor
   variables necessary for the IEQ calculation as an alternative to the
   traditional hardware used for this purpose. The system consists of some
   sensors and an Arduino board. One of the key strengths of Arduino is the
   possibility it affords of loading the script into the board's memory and
   letting it run without interfacing with computers, thus granting
   complete independence, portability and accuracy. Recent works have
   demonstrated that the cost of scientific equipment can be reduced by
   applying open-source principles to their design using a combination of
   the Arduino platform and a 3D printer. The evolution of the 3D printer
   has provided a new means of open design capable of accelerating
   self-directed development. The proposed nano Environmental Monitoring
   System (nEMoS) instrument is shown to have good reliability and it
   provides the foundation for a more critical approach to the use of

Abstract = {{Determination of moisture content of soil is absolutely crucial and must
   be performed frequently to assure the quality of construction work. In a
   view to suppress the limitations and inaccuracies of the existing
   methods, a new concept is successfully implemented. Artificial neural
   networks (ANNs) and state-of-the-art electronic circuitry are embedded
   to realize an automatic measurement system based on an open-source
   computing platform. Moreover, to facilitate user interaction with the
   system, a sophisticated graphical user interface (GUI) is created. This
   system, from both the hardware and software perspective, brings new
   ideas in, not only the moisture content determination test, but in
   geotechnical engineering laboratory and field instrumentation in terms
   of accuracy, automation, and machine intelligence. It will be obvious
   from this work that open-source hardware and software embedded in test
   equipment can automate the whole test procedure for almost all types of
   tests in geotechnical engineering using appropriate sensor, and
   data-acquisition and processing routines. This paper presents the
   technical know-how of the system setup, hardware, and software
   development, workflow, and system validation for the determination of
   moisture content of subgrade soil in two distinct test modes-supervised
   and unsupervised. This work will demonstrate that, not only the test
   procedure can be automated, but time optimization is also possible,
   which results in at least 50 \% test time reduction.}},

   the signals are then transformed from the time domain (time-amplitude)
   into the frequency domain (frequency-amplitude) via FFT to obtain the
   waveforms and frequencies of the cun, guan and chi pulses. It
   successfully extracts the data from the TCM pulse reading and can be a
   medical aid system for TCM. Combining the advantages of optical
   measurement and computer automation, this system provides a non-contact,
   easy to operate, fast in detection and low-cost equipment design.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new data-driven bottom-up monitoring approach
   for distribution systems. In this approach, local estimations of the
   subsections into which the system is split are performed independently,
   thus leading to a scalable architecture. The monitoring approach is
   focused only on the estimation of voltage magnitude rather than the
   complete state of the system. This reduces the measurement requirements
   significantly, thus addressing economical and technical concerns for
   existing systems, while staying open to accommodating further
   incremental improvements in the available data and data quality. The
   estimation of each section is realized via an artificial neural network
   (ANN), for which a set of parameterizations is available to cope with
   different operating conditions. The estimation convergence is achieved
   even with relatively few measurements, although accuracy varies
   depending on the available measurements. At the Medium Voltage (MV)
   level, where reconfiguration is common, a configuration identification
   unit chooses the right ANN, the one trained for the actual network
   configuration. The estimation process is computationally simple and can
   be executed on low-cost hardware, as demonstrated in this paper by the
   implementation on a BeagleBone Black board. To demonstrate the concept,
   a prototype and a laboratory setup have been developed. The experimental
   test results are presented both for an Low Voltage distribution system
   and an MV distribution system.}},

Journal = {{Scientific Reports}},

Abstract = {{Conventional deep brain stimulation (DBS) applies constant electrical
   stimulation to specific brain regions to treat neurological disorders.
   Closed-loop DBS with real-time feedback is gaining attention in recent
   years, after proved more effective than conventional DBS in terms of
   pathological symptom control clinically. Here we demonstrate the
   conceptualization and validation of a closed-loop DBS system using
   open-source hardware. We used hippocampal theta oscillations as system
   input, and electrical stimulation in the mesencephalic reticular
   formation (mRt) as controller output. It is well documented that
   hippocampal theta oscillations are highly related to locomotion, while
   electrical stimulation in the mRt induces freezing. We used an Arduino
   open-source microcontroller between input and output sources. This
   allowed us to use hippocampal local field potentials (LFPs) to steer
   electrical stimulation in the mRt. Our results showed that closed-loop
   DBS significantly suppressed locomotion compared to no stimulation, and
   required on average only 56\% of the stimulation used in open-loop DBS
   to reach similar effects. The main advantages of open-source hardware
   include wide selection and availability, high customizability, and
   affordability. Our open-source closed-loop DBS system is effective, and
   warrants further research using open-source hardware for closed-loop
   neuromodulation.}},

   results show that the proposed method requires the least number of
   operations and achieves comparable visual quality as compared with
   previous techniques. To further meet the requirement of real-time
   image/video applications, the 16-stage pipelined hardware architecture
   of our method is implemented as an intellectual property core. Our
   design yields a processing rate of about 200 MHz by using TSMC 0.13-mu m
   technology. Since it can process one pixel per clock cycle, for an image
   with a resolution of QSXGA (2560 x 2048), it requires about 27 ms to
   process one frame that is suitable for real-time applications. In some
   low-cost intelligent imaging systems, the processing rate can be slowed
   down, and our hardware core can run at very low power consumption.}},

   developing a standardized process for rating cookstove safety and
   reducing cookstove hazards. This paper identifies common cooking hazards
   and seeks to reduce cooking injuries by proposing ten field-based safety
   guidelines for solid fuel stoves. Each guideline describes an underlying
   safety principle and is accompanied by a test protocol and a metric to
   rate stove safety. This incremental rating system enables stove
   designers, donors, and consumers to track and promote stepwise safety
   improvements. The protocols use low-cost equipment to allow the many
   manufacturers of handcrafted coolcstoves to assess safety without using
   sophisticated testing facilities and expensive equipment. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) exists ubiquitously in our daily lives.
   It is usually achieved by using a physical controller such as a mouse,
   keyboard or touch screen. It hinders Natural User Interface (NUI) as
   there is a strong barrier between the user and computer. There are
   various hand tracking systems available on the market, but they are
   complex and expensive. In this paper, we present the design and
   development of a robust marker-less hand/finger tracking and gesture
   recognition system using low-cost hardware. We propose a simple but
   efficient method that allows robust and fast hand tracking despite
   complex background and motion blur. Our system is able to translate the
   detected hands or gestures into different functional inputs and
   interfaces with other applications via several methods. It enables
   intuitive HCI and interactive motion gaming. We also developed sample
   applications that can utilize the inputs from the hand tracking system.
   Our results show that an intuitive HCI and motion gaming system can be
   achieved with minimum hardware requirements.}},

Abstract = {{Technology is changing at a rapid rate, opening up new possibilities
   within the health care domain. Advances such as open source hardware,
   personal medical devices, and mobile phone apps are creating
   opportunities for custom-made medical devices and personalized care.
   However, they also introduce new challenges in balancing the need for
   regulation (ensuring safety and performance) with the need to innovate
   flexibly and efficiently. Compared with the emergence of new
   technologies, health technology design standards and regulations evolve
   slowly, and therefore, it can be difficult to apply these standards to
   the latest developments. For example, current regulations may not be
   suitable for approaches involving open source hardware, an increasingly
   popular way to create medical devices in the maker community. Medical
   device standards may not be flexible enough when evaluating the
   usability of mobile medical devices that can be used in a multitude of
   different ways, outside of clinical settings. Similarly, while
   regulatory guidance has been updated to address the proliferation of
   health-related mobile phone apps, it can be hard to know if and when
   these regulations apply. In this viewpoint, we present three examples of
   novel medical technologies to illustrate the types of regulatory issues
   that arise in the current environment. We also suggest opportunities for
   support, such as advances in the way we review and monitor medical
   technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Advanced video technology is available for
   sleep-laboratories. However, low-cost equipment for screening in the
   home setting has not been identified and tested, nor has a methodology
   for analysis of video recordings been suggested.
   Methods: We investigated different combinations of hardware/software for
   home-videosomnography (HVS) and established a process for qualitative
   and quantitative analysis of HVS-recordings. A case vignette (HVS
   analysis for a 5.5-year-old girl with major insomnia and several
   co-morbidities) demonstrates how methodological considerations were
   addressed and how HVS added value to clinical assessment.
   Results: We suggest an ``ideal set of hardware/software{''} that is
   reliable, affordable (similar to\$500) and portable (=2.8 kg) to conduct
   non-invasive HVS, which allows time-lapse analyses. The equipment
   consists of a net-book, a camera with infrared optics, and a video
   capture device. (1) We present an HVS-analysis protocol consisting of
   three steps of analysis at varying replay speeds: (a) basic overview and
   classification at 16x normal speed; (b) second viewing and detailed
   descriptions at 4-8x normal speed, and (c) viewing, listening, and
   in-depth descriptions at real-time speed. (2) We also present a custom
   software program that facilitates video analysis and note-taking
   (Annotator (c)), and Optical Flow software that automatically quantifies
   movement for internal quality control of the HVS-recording. The case
   vignette demonstrates how the HVS-recordings revealed the dimension of
   insomnia caused by restless legs syndrome, and illustrated the cascade
   of symptoms, challenging behaviors, and resulting medications.
   Conclusion: The strategy of using HVS, although requiring validation and
   reliability testing, opens the floor for a new ``observational sleep
   medicine,{''} which has been useful in describing discomfort-related
   behavioral movement patterns in patients with communication difficulties
   presenting with challenging/disruptive sleep/wake behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{The need for constant monitoring of environmental conditions has
   produced an increase in the development of wireless sensor networks
   (WSN). The drive towards smart cities has produced the need for smart
   sensors to be able to monitor what is happening in our cities. This,
   combined with the decrease in hardware component prices and the increase
   in the popularity of open hardware, has favored the deployment of sensor
   networks based on open hardware. The new trends in Internet Protocol
   (IP) communication between sensor nodes allow sensor access via the
   Internet, turning them into smart objects (Internet of Things and Web of
   Things). Currently, WSNs provide data in different formats. There is a
   lack of communication protocol standardization, which turns into
   interoperability issues when connecting different sensor networks or
   even when connecting different sensor nodes within the same network.
   This work presents a sensorized platform proposal that adheres to the
   principles of the Internet of Things and the Web of Things. Wireless
   sensor nodes were built using open hardware solutions, and
   communications rely on the HTTP/IP Internet protocols. The Open
   Geospatial Consortium (OGC) SensorThings API candidate standard was used
   as a neutral format to avoid interoperability issues. An environmental
   WSN developed following the proposed architecture was built as a proof
   of concept. Details on how to build each node and a study regarding
   energy concerns are presented.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of the Internet of Things is rapidly becoming a reality,
   with many applications being deployed within industrial and consumer
   sectors. At the thing' leveldevices and inter-device network
   communicationthe core technical building blocks are generally the same
   as those found in wireless sensor network implementations. For the
   Internet of Things to continue growing, we need more plentiful resources
   for building intelligent devices and sensor networks. Unfortunately,
   current commercial devices, e.g., sensor nodes and network gateways,
   tend to be expensive and proprietary, which presents a barrier to entry
   and arguably slows down further development. There are, however, an
   increasing number of open embedded platforms available and also a wide
   selection of off-the-shelf components that can quickly and easily be
   built into device and network gateway solutions. The question is whether
   these solutions measure up to built-for-purpose devices. In the paper,
   we provide a comparison of existing built-for-purpose devices against
   open source devices. For comparison, we have also designed and rapidly
   prototyped a sensor node based on off-the-shelf components. We show that
   these devices compare favorably to built-for-purpose devices in terms of
   performance, power and cost. Using open platforms and off-the-shelf
   components would allow more developers to build intelligent devices and
   sensor networks, which could result in a better overall development
   ecosystem, lower barriers to entry and rapid growth in the number of IoT
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{ExpertEyes is a low-cost, open-source package of hardware and software
   that is designed to provide portable high-definition eyetracking. The
   project involves several technological innovations, including
   portability, high-definition video recording, and multiplatform software
   support. It was designed for challenging recording environments, and all
   processing is done offline to allow for optimization of parameter
   estimation. The pupil and corneal reflection are estimated using a novel
   forward eye model that simultaneously fits both the pupil and the
   corneal reflection with full ellipses, addressing a common situation in
   which the corneal reflection sits at the edge of the pupil and therefore
   breaks the contour of the ellipse. The accuracy and precision of the
   system are comparable to or better than what is available in commercial
   eyetracking systems, with a typical accuracy of less than 0.4A degrees
   and best accuracy below 0.3A degrees, and with a typical precision (SD
   method) around 0.3A degrees and best precision below 0.2A degrees. Part
   of the success of the system comes from a high-resolution eye image. The
   high image quality results from uncasing common digital camcorders and
   recording directly to SD cards, which avoids the limitations of the
   analog NTSC format. The software is freely downloadable, and complete
   hardware plans are available, along with sources for custom parts.}},

Title = {{History of extreme ultraviolet solar measurements in XX-XXI centuries:
   from balloons to the International Space Station as instrumental
   platforms}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{The Sun was one of the central points for observations as long as human
   cultures are known. After researchers observed the extension of the
   solar rainbow spectrum towards shorter wavelengths with increasing
   altitude they started measurements of the solar ultraviolet spectrum
   from balloons in 1934. The acquisition of spectra in the extreme
   ultraviolet and soft X-ray spectral regions was beginning after 1946
   using photographic recordings aboard rockets. However, it took six more
   years to achieve good spectral resolution below about 220 nm because
   servomechanisms had to be developed to fairly accurately point the
   spectrographs to the Sun during the rocket flight. Another big step
   forward was achieved by the application of photoelectric recording
   technology and by using satellites as a platform to observe
   qualitatively the strong variability of the solar ultraviolet irradiance
   on short-, medium-and long-term scales. Until the end of the past
   century these measurements have been strongly impeded by the inherent
   degradation of the EUV instruments with time. Since there is progress
   solving this serious problem, measurements with sufficient radiometric
   accuracy allow composing the data available to the first set of
   ultraviolet data covering a period of eleven years. Based on the
   sophisticated instrumentation verified in space, future EUV measurements
   of the solar spectral irradiance on the International Space Station are
   promising accuracy levels of about 5\%. Added by low-cost equipment
   on-line measurements will allow providing data needed in ionospheric
   modeling for correcting propagation delays of navigation signals from
   space to Earth. Adding ultraviolet airglow and auroral emission
   measurements the impact of space weather on the ionosphere can be
   studied and also be used deriving more detailed correction procedures
   for the evaluation of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals.

Abstract = {{We investigated submerged ruins from the 1923 Nebukawa landslide, which
   was caused by the 1923 Kanto earthquake. The on-land areas affected by
   the landslide have been restored and evidence of the landslide is mostly
   gone, but huge structures that appear to be man-made have been observed
   by divers on the seafloor near the area of the landslide. We used a fish
   finder designed for leisure use and other low-cost equipment to conduct
   a marine acoustic survey. Because the affected area off Nebukawa is
   close to shore and shallow and the tools were sufficiently lightweight,
   we were able to use an inflatable raft for the survey. We created a
   bathymetric map and side-scan images showing features of the landslide
   mass and scattered huge structures exposed on the seafloor. After the
   acoustic investigations, we conducted a diving investigation and were
   able to ascertain that the structures were made of concrete and were
   most likely parts of the old Nebukawa station. The ruins were displaced
   about 260 to 320 m horizontally from the original station location (to
   110-170 m offshore) and were mixed with coarse rock fragments from the
   landslide mass. The distribution of bottom materials suggests that the
   landslide struck the seafloor and then traveled as far as 460 m offshore
   from the coastline. The landslide had an equivalent coefficient of
   friction (H/L) of about 0.15, indicating high mobility. The landslide
   probably transformed into a turbulent flow mixed with basal sandy
   sediments, which propelled the debris farther offshore. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{In the past 50 years, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) has gained
   widespread recognition as a life-saving skill that can be taught
   successfully to the general public. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation can be
   considered a cost-effective intervention that requires minimal classroom
   training and low-cost equipment and supplies; it is commonly taught
   throughout much of the developed world. But, the simplicity of CPR
   training and its access for the general public may be misleading, as
   outcomes for patients in cardiopulmonary arrest are poor and survival is
   dependent upon a comprehensive ``chain-of-survival,'' which is something
   not achieved easily in resource-limited health care settings. In
   addition to the significant financial and physical resources needed to
   both train and develop basic CPR capabilities within a community, there
   is a range of ethical questions that should also be considered. This
   report describes some of the financial and ethical challenges that might
   result from CPR training in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). It
   is determined that for many health care systems, CPR training may have
   financial and ethically-deleterious, unintended consequences. Evidence
   shows Basic Life Support (BLS) skills training in a community is an
   effective intervention to improve public health. But, health care
   systems with limited resources should include CPR training only after
   considering the full implications of that intervention.}},

Abstract = {{The flexibility of software-defined radio (SDR) technology has been
   proposed to support various applications from the dynamic usage of the
   radio frequency spectrum to the implementation of radio access
   technologies in the commercial and military domain. A new generation of
   low-cost SDR devices has emerged in the last few years, opening new
   possibilities to implement inexpensive security attacks against radio
   protocols and systems. Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunication
   (DECT) is a European Telecommunications Standards Institute standard for
   short-range cordless communications with a worldwide installed base. In
   this paper, we survey the state of art for the application of low-cost
   SDRs to the security domain, and we describe a complete implementation
   of a passive eavesdropping attack against DECT digital voice
   communication, where the DECT communication is not encrypted. The
   framework, which implements the attack, has been deployed on two
   different types of low-cost SDR platforms to show the flexibility and
   extendibility of the implementation. The performance of the framework
   has been evaluated on the basis of different parameters and different
   approaches, and the experimental results are presented in the paper. The
   framework has demonstrated its effectiveness to implement an
   eavesdropping attack against DECT even at great distances with low-cost

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to present the new, innovative teaching
   approach and tinkering pedagogy towards developing the students skills
   in STEM domains (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) with
   aim to the designing the laboratory for radiation detector development.
   Involving from one side concept of social situatedness and
   connectedness, and from another the concept of independent,
   self-directed and self-regulated student learning, the project was based
   on assembling the mini-lab, Radiation Sensor Board for Arduino, that was
   originally designed to help people in Japan to measure levels of
   radiation in their everyday life after the Fukushima accident. As it was
   reported elsewhere, this product was an example of crowdsourcing. When
   Libelien designed the Radiation Sensor Board for Waspmote, the idea was
   simple: with the Arduino platform people will be able to have easily
   running their own detector at home while on the other hand with Waspmote
   platform authorities will be able to deploy autonomous sensor networks
   to send the radiation levels from dangerous areas using wireless sensor
   platform ZigBee and GPRS technologies. This paper present students
   developing project where the Sensor Board for Arduino was used as
   assembling, teaching tool. The Do-It-Yourself and Internet of Things can
   be used both in educational, and in the research and development
   purposes. Owning their own mini-lab at their disposal anytime, students
   worked at their learning speed. It also boosted the interest, confidence
   of students and highly affected three domains of learning: cognitive
   domain (activities like instrumentation, modeling, experimentation, data
   analysis and design, psychomotor domain (activities like manipulating
   the apparatus, sensory awareness) and affective domain (behavior and
   attitudes to learn from failure, creativity, collaborative
   communication, safety and ethics in the laboratory). We show that
   networking learning, supported by hands-on labs on chip, and an open
   source electronics prototyping platform as Arduino and Raspberry Pi,
   give great opportunities for teaching and learning the tinkering and
   inventing skills, an request we have to deal with it at the University
   of Montenegro. Such project support exploratory and serendipitous
   learning. It moved teching from an emphasis simply on linear logic and
   programmed instruction, towards non-linear, networked, branching,
   hypertext views of learning, in which connections between knowledge are
   made and developed. It is based on principle of situated cognition and
   Vigotskian thought: situatedness, commonality, interdependency and
   infrastructure where learning is fascinated by an activity. The
   presented project integrate a Virtual Learning Environment, networking
   knowledge and student-owned movable laboratory on the chip, where
   radiation was used as a topic and where electronics was embedded and
   embodied.}},

Abstract = {{In 2015 NASA plans to launch a payload to 280 Km altitude on a sounding
   rocket from the Wallops Flight Facility. This payload will contain
   several novel technologies that work together to demonstrate
   methodologies for space sample return missions and for nanosatellite
   communications in general. The payload will deploy and test an
   Exo-Brake, which slows the payload aerodynamically, providing eventual
   de-orbit and recovery of future ISS samples through a Small Payload
   Quick Return project. In addition, this flight addresses future Mars
   mission entry technology, space-to-space communications using the
   Iridium Short Messaging Service (SMS), GPS tracking, and wireless
   sensors using the ZigBee protocol. SOAREX-8 is being assembled and
   tested at Ames Research Center (ARC) and the NASA Engineering and Safety
   Center (NESC) is funding sensor and communications work. Open source
   Arduino technology and software are used for system control. The ZigBee
   modules used are XBee units that connect analog sensors for temperature,
   air pressure and acceleration measurement wirelessly to the payload
   telemetry system. Our team is developing methods for power distribution
   and module mounting, along with software for sensor integration, data
   assembly and downlink. We have demonstrated relaying telemetry to the
   ground using the Iridium satellite constellation on a previous flight,
   but the upcoming flight will be the first time we integrate useful
   flight test data from a ZigBee wireless sensor network. Wireless sensor
   data will measure the aerodynamic efficacy of the Exo-Brake permitting
   further on-orbit flight tests of improved designs. The Exo-Brake is 5
   m(2) in area and will be stored in a container and deployed during
   ascent once the payload is jettisoned from the launch vehicle. We intend
   to further refine the hardware and continue testing on balloon launches,
   future sounding rocket flights and on nanosatellite missions. The use of
   standards-based and open-source hardware/software has allowed for this
   project to be completed with a very modest budget and a challenging
   schedule. There is a wealth of hardware and software available for both
   the Arduino platform and the XBee, all low-cost or open-source. Along
   with the Exo-Brake hardware and deployment discussion, this paper will
   describe in detail the system architecture emphasizing the successful
   use of open-source hardware and software to minimize effort and cost.
   Testing procedures, radio frequency interference (RFI) mitigation,
   success criteria and expected results will also be discussed. The use of
   Iridium short messaging capability for space-to-space links,
   standards-based wireless sensor networks, and other innovative
   communications technology are also presented.}},

   digital systems coupled with an unacceptably large number of silicon
   respins led to growing importance of comprehensive and automated design
   verification. Akin to software configuration management, it is becoming
   commonplace to maintain large hardware design code-bases with hardware
   configuration management tools. A missing piece of crucial technology in
   this approach is to manage design verification across evolving hardware
   designs. In this paper, we propose an efficient methodology for
   automatically localizing design errors across design versions. The
   proposed technique, EvoDeb, can be easily integrated into a hardware
   configuration management framework and is scalable for large designs. We
   demonstrate the efficacy of EvoDeb on a couple of bugs on open-source

Abstract = {{Nowadays, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) platform are widely employed
   in a broad range of applications: from environmental monitoring and
   precise agriculture to humanitarian localization and rescue and
   prevention of events such as floods, fires, landslides. On the other
   hand, Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) is an
   emerging technique which allows to monitor Earths surface parameters.
   Recently, this technique has been applied to soil moisture monitoring.
   In this paper, a prototype of a GNSS-based passive radar, able to
   exploit GNSS reflected signals from ground for soil moisture monitoring
   applications is presented. The prototype is able to handle signals
   coming from three antennas: one up-looking Right-Hand (RH) Circular
   Polarized antenna, for the direct signal from satellite, and two
   down-looking antennas, one RH and the other Left-Hand (LH) Circular
   Polarized, to measure the signals coming after reflection from ground.
   It is made of low-cost hardware and it is small and lightweight in order
   to be mounted on board an aircraft or a UAV. It basically serves as data
   grabber: the collected data are stored to memory for off-line
   processing. The design and development of the prototype is illustrated
   and early results of an in-field test campaign are also presented.}},

Abstract = {{Wearable robotics is strongly oriented to humans. New applications for

   followed for the realization of three prototypes obtained using rapid
   prototyping techniques, i.e., a 3D printer and an open hardware
   development platform. Both fully actuated and under-actuated solutions
   have been explored. In the proposed wearable design, the robotic
   extra-finger can be worn as a bracelet in its rest position. The
   availability of a supplementary finger in the human hand allows to
   enlarge its workspace, improving grasping and manipulation capabilities.

   are truly uncountable different possible hardware/software low cost
   choices available for University teaching which could be complementary

   platforms can offer different advantages with respect to traditional
   ones; first, they assure a bottom-up approach, which guarantees a
   pleasant and constructive learning with a gradual comprehension of
   concepts from the simple ones to more complex ones. Then, these cheap
   and readily available platforms permit to verify (also at home) the
   theoretical concepts and the proposed exercises with low cost devices
   rather than with expensive ones. Finally, the learning outcomes of the
   basic courses are indispensable to advanced courses where sensors,

   Efficient methods are required to properly register and calibrate the

   lattice detection algorithm developed for outdoor images. Once the
   lattice is extracted, crossing points of the color fields are used for
   perspective geometric transform while the color plates guide the color
   calibration process. Our method is tested on 37 images collected within
   the German Calciphylaxis Registry. At least, 28 out of the 35 possible
   grid points have been extracted in all the non-standardizes photographs,
   with at most two false positive detections. The lowest F-measure was
   above 80\%. Hence, ruler and other calibration devices become obsolete

Abstract = {{Nowadays embedded systems have reached a great level of maturity and
   diffusion thanks to their small size, low power consumption, large
   connectivity and variety of application in everyday contexts. These
   systems, if properly structured and configured, can significantly
   increase the smartness of the environments where they are deployed,
   monitoring and continuously collecting data to be processed and
   elaborated. Such operations can be correctly executed, especially in
   large locations, if several embedded systems nodes are deployed under
   the design of an intelligent network. This paper presents SMuNe, a Smart
   Multisensor Network based on the BeableBone Black platform, a complete
   open hardware and software embedded computer; the challenge is to create
   a multi-purpose hierarchical network composed by smart nodes able to
   gain and manage heterogeneous data and spaces according to the Internet
   of Things (IoT) paradigm. As a proof of the effectiveness of SMuNe we
   conducted an experimentation within the Cultural Heritage domain; in
   detail we deployed SMuNe within a sculptures exhibition named ``The

Abstract = {{During a disaster, conventional communications infrastructures are often
   compromised, which prevents local populations from contacting family,
   friends, and colleagues. The lack of communication also impedes
   responder efforts to gather, organize, and disseminate information. This
   problem is made worse by the unique cost and operational constraints
   typically associated with the humanitarian assistance and disaster
   relief (HADR) space. In response, we present a low-cost, scalable system
   that creates a wide-area, best-effort, ad-hoc wireless network for
   emergency information. The Communication Assistance Technology over
   Ad-Hoc Networks (CATAN) system embraces the maker and do it yourself
   (DIY) communities by leveraging open-source and hobbyist technologies to
   create cheap, lightweight, battery powered nodes that can be deployed
   quickly for a variety of operations. CATAN enables geographically
   separated users to share information on standard interfaces, i.e. web
   and SMS, over commonly-used communication interfaces, i.e. GSM and
   Wi-Fi. These interfaces enable CATAN to accommodate a variety of digital
   devices while leveraging the global ubiquity of cellular devices. By
   emphasizing simple, mature, technologies, CATAN avoids many problems
   that hinder many general purpose ad-hoc technologies. We have tested our
   infrastructure in a variety of environments and have open-sourced the
   entire project to encourage collaboration with the greater HADR
   community.}},

Abstract = {{Inverted pendulum is a highly non-linear system, which makes it a
   complex control problem that may be articulated for various real-life
   applications. Usually, its linearized model is implemented and
   controlled using a typical Proportional-Integral-Derivate (PID)
   controller but a different controller is required to control the actual,
   non-linear model. In the current work, we aim to develop an indigenous
   and experimental hardware platform to implement conventional PID, Fuzzy
   and Hybrid techniques. Hardware setup of this model is implemented on a
   4-wheeler mobile cart with an inverted rod mechanism (pendulum). Control
   circuit is implemented through Arduino and associated control circuitry.
   The controller is simulated on MATLAB/Simulink and implemented on this
   hardware platform to validate minimum possible deflection of pendulum
   from a reference vertical position using PID, Fuzzy and hybrid control
   schemes. Results are promising from an FLC scheme applied on the close
   to real non-linear model of the system.}},

Abstract = {{A Cognitive Radio is a Software Defined Radio (SDR). The Cognitive radio
   network is capable to sense and analyze its surrounding environment as
   well as reconfigure its operation in accordance with this radio
   environment. In this way, based on the available Channel State
   Information (CSI), the cognitive radio network may dynamically access
   the spectrum. MIMO based cognitive radio system enabled dynamically
   simultaneous usage of a radio spectrum for this beam forming signal
   processing technique is used.
   Beam forming is a technique in which the directionality of transmission
   and reception of radio signals can be controlled. Modern wireless
   technology depends on beam forming technology in order to provide higher
   data rates, improved coverage and also used to share the spectrum with
   the other users.
   Hardware complexity is one of the main issue in MIMO based wireless
   system which require N number of RF chains for N antenna systems.
   Antenna sub array formation (ASF) scheme is an optimization technique
   which can be used to reduce the RF chain required such a way the
   capacity can be improved. This will reduce the cost of the hardware much
   and we can realize low cost hardware system. Usually the two process of
   sub array formation and beam forming are done as separate process but in
   this paper the joint beam forming and sub array formation is done such a
   way the secondary user capacity will be improved and to avoid two
   computational complex process. Antenna sub array formation (ASF) scheme
   is employed to maximize the Signal to Interference Ratio (SINR) by using
   all antenna elements. In Antenna sub array formation the Radio Frequency
   chain is allocated to sub array of elements.}},

Abstract = {{The design and implementation of Smart Grids takes usually into account

   currents at the installation main distribution panel, the transmission
   and storage of the respective data in a personal computer, and their

Abstract = {{Thermographic inspection is a relatively new technique for
   Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) which has been gathering increasing
   interest due to its relatively low cost hardware and extremely fast data
   acquisition properties. This technique is especially promising in the
   area of rapid automated damage detection and quantification. In
   collaboration with a major industry partner from the aerospace sector
   advanced thermography-based NDT software for impact damaged composites
   is introduced. The software is based on correlation analysis of
   time-temperature profiles in combination with an image enhancement
   process. The prototype software is aiming to a) better visualise the
   damages in a relatively easy-to-use way and b) automatically and
   quantitatively measure the properties of the degradation. Knowing that
   degradation properties play an important role in the identification of
   degradation types, tests and results on specimens which were
   artificially damaged have been performed and analyzed. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {{Reliable and secured communication between two or more devices require
   wired connection. A wireless communication such as - Bluetooth, WI-Fi,
   ZigBee etc. provides flexible and inexpensive solution for remote
   applications. A large number of low cost hardware platforms such as
   Raspberry Pi, Arduino, mbed boards etc. are available that do not
   provide any inbuilt wireless module but are equipped with UART, I2C
   ports for design and development of Internet of Things (IoT) and
   embedded applications. Designers face the difficulty to use such a low
   cost hardware for wireless communication in order to implement these
   applications. In this paper, Design \& Development of Daughter Board for
   Raspberry Pi to support Bluetooth Communication using UART is proposed
   as an integrated solution. Results of various QoS parameters such as
   transmission rate, file format(text, pdf, image \& audio), baud ratesand
   range for Bluetooth communication between two devices are presented. The
   result shows that Bluetooth module is capable of transmitting files of
   same size in different format approximately in same time. Proposed
   solution can further be extended to different protocols such as Wi-Fi

Abstract = {{this paper presents a cascaded integrator comb compensator filter with a
   multiplierless implementable structure. A second order linear phase
   filter is realized with minimum error approximation of the coefficients.
   The compensator filter coefficients are presented in a canonical signed
   digits form. Presented design can be implemented using low cost hardware
   units such as add and shift operations. The results show that the
   compensator filter not only reduces the power consumption but also
   improves the pass band drop of the CIC filter.}},

Abstract = {{The paper deals with the issues to monitor the energy performance of
   PhotoVoltaic (PV) fields by means of low cost hardware. In fact, the
   monitoring systems for low or medium rated power PV plants are often
   constituted by a limited number of sensors and low processing capacity.
   These systems allow a supervision of the PV fields when strong
   reductions of the produced energy happen, but they are ineffective to
   alert the end user about a gradual energy reduction. These issues are
   related to the natural ageing of PV modules, the dust or dirt
   accumulation on the PV modules, and so on. This paper proposes a
   methodology based on inferential tools, which return information about
   the correct operation of the PV field. The methodology needs an initial
   training that allows to define one or more reference strings, which will
   be used as benchmarks for future comparisons.}},

Abstract = {{Inclusive Education has been the agenda at all levels and modalities of
   the education system, which discusses how the school will face the
   diversity and teach students who have disabilities. According to the
   2010 Census, in Brazil, people with physical disabilities account for
   almost 7\% of the population. This project aims to design Digital
   Learning Constructs (DLC) as an inclusive education model implemented by
   use of Brain Computer Interface (BCI). Thus, it is intended to assist
   people with mobility limitations in the process of school inclusion. A
   DLC is any entity or device devised or built in a multidisciplinary way
   in the form of an educational game, helping players to build or redesign
   their knowledge. It has as features, dual nature, as an object of
   learning and also a game, working procedurally the contributions of each
   area without any subordination between them. Thus, via BCI, the user
   will not use mouse, but a specific low cost hardware, which will command
   the computer via brain waves. Future studies with the user will be
   conducted through a qualitative, quantitative and ergonomic design
   approach. The study subjects are people with motor and communication
   problems, of the municipal education network. The importance of studies
   linked to the autonomy of these subjects is due to the fact that many do
   not have freedom of movement, because of motor impairments. The aim of
   this project is to open paths for people with motor impairments and
   degenerative diseases, so they can use the computer in the classroom
   context.}},

Abstract = {{Clock and/or frequency synchronization is a common requirement in modern
   distributed measurement and control systems, such as Internet of Things

   possibility of sub 1 microsecond precision provided by low-cost advanced
   IEEE 1588 implementations sets the industry standard today. The
   performance and price of IEEE 1588 implementations are primarily defined
   by the master clocks and their actual installation and configuration.
   The paper investigate how master clock architectures, i.e., how the
   master clock is connected to the reference clock, influence price and
   performance; and in addition, it also details how the architecture
   effects installation and configuration requirements. The primary factors
   of investigation are ambient temperature and delay compensation required
   due to signal transmission time. The paper also introduces the
   architecture and performance of a Linux based open source/hardware

Abstract = {{Timing is critical when trying to engage students in various engineering
   career paths. While many ``National Engineers Week{''} programs exist
   for primary and middle school students, there is a lack of hands on
   activities for students in the 9th-12th grades. It is often difficult to
   devise experiments for this age group that are interesting and not
   juvenile. Yet, it is during these crucial years that most students are
   lost to science, math and engineering. Engaging students and presenting
   opportunities for invention and excitement is important in the teen
   years, when peer pressure and the distractions of friends, social
   events, and activities are particularly high.(1). There are a number of
   open source programming and affordable hardware platforms that can be
   used to implement low cost and interactive programs to promote
   innovation with various age groups. In this paper we share our work, as
   well as our learnings on how to make the workshops more effective. We
   have created various Arduino projects that can be customized to grade
   levels ranging from grades 7-12, and even college undergraduate
   students. The various projects we describe in this paper have been used
   to interact with students of different grade levels to engage in basic
   elements of engineering and computer programming. The classes should be
   set up to work in groups to promote shared innovation, teamwork and
   collaboration with peers. The open source and hardware experimenting
   exposed the students to various career paths ranging from software
   engineer, to electronic engineers and basic elements of various other
   engineering paths. This paper is designed to demonstrate the promotion
   of the engineering profession in schools through the use of Arduino Uno,
   Raspberry Pi Gemma kits, and Flora kits. The programs are also designed
   to accommodate classroom setting, workshops, or as an in-class field
   trip.}},

Abstract = {{During last years unmanned ground and aerial vehicles captured the
   attention of researchers and companies, while the available set of
   Unmanned Surface Vehicle platforms is smaller. In many scenarios an
   integrated approach is required considering a heterogeneous fleet of
   vehicles. In this paper we focus on the development of a low-cost
   unmanned surface platform for digital surveys. The boat has been
   designed to navigate also in shallow water owing to a low draft design.
   An embedded system with Robot Operating System (ROS) onboard has been
   deployed on the surface vehicle. One of the main advantages of the
   proposed solution is its reduced cost owing to open-hardware/software
   solutions. In particular, an open-hardware solution is responsible for
   the interfacing of an RTK GPS with a bathymetric ultrasound sensor to
   map the sea/lake / river floor. The boat can be either remotely
   controllable or fully autonomous. An Augmented Reality (AR) application
   has been also developed to show the path and the set of survey blocks
   that are mapped/not mapped. The AR application is particularly useful
   when the user remotely controls the boat, but also for supervising the
   autonomous survey. The performances achieved in the first trials are
   satisfactory and the AR application produces significant maps.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the design of a portable carbon dioxide detector
   from low cost hardware and software components. The carbon dioxide
   molecules absorb light at a specific wavelength of 4.26 mu m in the
   mid-infrared radiation. High concentrations of carbon dioxide molecules
   absorb more IR light than low concentrations. The design of the system
   includes a monochromatic infrared source, located in the source housing,
   and is activated by a constant voltage source obtained from the
   Switching Regulator Assembly. The infrared energy entering the sample
   chamber is absorbed at the wavelength specified as a result of the
   concentration of carbon dioxide being measured. The reflector assembly
   at the rear of the sample chamber returns the energy onto the IR
   detector. The detector signal is amplified by a low noise pre-amplifier
   and directed to the microprocessor. The signal goes into the processor
   through an ADC circuit. The amplitude of the digital signal is then
   threshold detected at a predetermined value to detect the amount of
   carbon dioxide.}},

Abstract = {{Hardware-in-loop (HiL) simulation focuses on testing of Electronic
   Control Units (ECU) in virtual real time environment in order to
   scrutinize the behavior of controller under test. Use of HiL simulation
   in development process reduces time and cost involved in verification
   and validation of the ECU's development. Generally, HiL systems
   developed using dSPACE (R), National Instruments (R) and other platforms
   used in automotive industry are very costly and sophisticated. For less
   complex systems a low cost HiL testing approach using an existing target
   hardware can be opted. It may or may not be possible to use existing
   hardware, as there might be limitations in the availability of pin
   count, onchip peripherals etc.
   This paper discusses a case study of Electronic Speed Limiter (ESL)
   where a low-cost HiL testing technique is being implemented for
   verification and validation of ESL. The ESL HiL system developed using
   existing target hardware can simulate different vehicle dynamics, driver
   behaviors, various road profiles and frictional coefficients in
   approximation to that of real time environment. The development process
   of a low cost HIL and research outcomes of ESL testing using the
   developed ESL HiL are discussed in detail. Developed simulation model
   increased scope of testing control logic of ESL. The results of HIL
   testing are found likely to ``in-vehicle{''} testing and at same time
   controller under test is tested safely with low cost approach.}},

Abstract = {{Tail-biting convolutional codes (TBCC) have been applied in many recent
   modern communication standards such as LTE and WIMAX. TBCC is a method
   applied in conventional convolutional code by replacing a fixed
   zero-tail with tail-biting data constrains to achieve a better coding
   efficiency. This modification makes the decoding process becomes much
   more complex. Due to impracticality of the optimum decoding algorithm
   such as brute force, recently some suboptimum algorithms have been
   developed but it still leaves a large amount of computation due to the
   iterative nature wherein the number of iterations depends on the
   received codeword causes inefficient system for implementation,
   especially for real time applications. In this paper we offer a new
   algorithm that is specific to low cost hardware implementation. Low cost
   criteria are addressed to minimum amount of computation for each
   decoding process. In addition to causing smaller area consumption, the
   lack of computing process will also make decoding processing time
   becomes faster. This algorithm that we call reverse trellis algorithm
   also offers a fixed amount of computation regardless to the received
   codeword, thus will not require extra memory consumption as it being on
   an implementation. Taking a case study on TBCC configuration for LTE,
   proposed algorithm requires 5712 adding operations and 3008 inverting
   operations. A significant decrease compared to 286736, adding 143360
   inverting for Brute Force and 45079976738816 adding 1099511627776
   inverting for all possible fixed tail ML decoder. In the performance of
   BER, reverse trellis algorithm is able to deliver improved by more than
   1 dB compared to direct terminating ML decoder.}},

Abstract = {{The use of Television White Spaces (TVWS) for broadband communication
   has raised interest of late. In respect of rural areas, wireless is the
   only viable alternative for providing affordable telecommunications
   services. One limiting factor to the growth of wireless broadband
   penetration is the lack of available spectrum. White Spaces refer to
   regions of radio spectrum that are not used all the time in a specific
   geographical location. An assessment study on TV White Spaces
   availability in Malawi using affordable tools has been described and it
   was concluded that it is possible to assess the spectrum usage using low
   cost equipment. In this paper, the design aspects and the measured
   results of a low cost Television White Space Z antenna are described.}},

Abstract = {{In the last decades drop-on-demand inkjet technology played an
   increasing role in industrial and medical applications. This is due to
   the ability to deposit a small amount of material in precisely defined
   position. In the field of Biofabrication, inkjet printers are used to
   build 2D and 3D scaffolds and gels with biological molecules, including
   living cells. Several works, including seminal papers on inkjet
   bioprinting, were carried out with modified office printers. These
   printers have fixed structural characteristics and operating size,
   especially on the print-head, limiting the range of materials that can
   be dispensed. The aim of the present work is the design and fabrication
   of an open-source piezoelectric inkjet print-head, optimized for the
   bioprinting field. This low-cost, reproducible, reliable, versatile and
   biocompatible device will enable various research laboratories to work
   with a shared device; the open source allowing for parts to be modified
   to suit specific needs. The design was carried out by Finite Element
   (FE) modelling of the piezoelectric, mechanical, fluid dynamics and
   their coupling. The design was optimized for shear rate, which we
   minimized in order to be able to print cells. The mechanical frame of
   the printer was designed and built using a low-cost 3D printer. The
   nozzle plate was fabricated from a polycarbonate disc coated with
   biocompatible silicone, to increase the hydrophobicity of the outer
   surface of the disc, preventing ink adhesion on the edge of the nozzle;
   the refilling system, and the electronic control were also part of the
   project and will be freely available to download. The FE models were
   validated with ad-hoc experiments, printing water, gelatin solution, and
   cell culture media, by modulating the wave power in amplitude, frequency
   and duty cycle. The tests showed a large working window both respect to
   viscosity and to surface tension. Finally Human Skin Fibroblasts
   (ATCC-CRL-2522, Teddington UK), suspended in culture media, were
   printed. Cell viability, assessed by CellTiter-Blue and LIVE / DEAD
   tests, resulted comparable with the control, demonstrating the validity
   of the first open source piezoelectric inkjet print-head for
   biofabrication. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an open

Abstract = {{Decision making of a vertebrate in response to the sensory signals from
   the environment is regulated by the neuromodulatory systems in its
   brain. A vertebrate's behaviors like focusing attention, cautious
   risk-aversion and curiosity seeking exploration are influenced by these
   neuromodulatory. The paper presents an autonomous robotic control
   approach based on vertebrate neuromodulation and its implementation on
   multiple open-source hardware platforms. A simple neural network is used
   to model the neuromodulatory functions for generating context based
   behavioral responses to sensory signals. The neural network incorporates
   three types of neurons- attention focusing cholinergic and noradrenergic
   (ACh/NE), curiosity-seeking dopaminergic (DA), and risk aversive
   serotonergic (5-HT) neurons. The implementation of the neuronal model on
   multiple relatively simple autonomous robots is illustrated through the
   interesting behavior of the robots adapting to changes in the
   environment. The implementation is done in open-source, open-access
   robotics software framework of Robot Operating System (ROS).}},

   paralyzed human beings became isolated from the society for not having a
   proper existence and due to their reluctances of doing normal life
   works. Therefore, we have researched on the Human Machine Interaction
   using Physical Human Body Gestures and came up to proposed solution of
   the said issue as Low Cost Retina Controlled Computer Using Head mount
   and Wrist Tilt for Persons who are Paralyzed and cannot be able to move
   their hands and even they can't able to walk. Conventionally, we named
   it as simple as Retina Controlled Computer, is based on Google Glass
   vision using motion recognition, Zigbee Wireless Technology, Retina
   Controlled Device that allows human beings with paralysis resulting from
   Paralysis to do everything on computer even controlling the personal
   mobile phone using only their Eye and Head movements. This whole project
   will be based mainly on the new technology of Low Cost Wireless Zigbee
   Sensors, Arduino Microcontrollers, and motion and retina recognition
   using Accelerometer. Arduino Microcontroller consists of an open-source
   hardware board designed around an 8-bit Atmel AVR microcontroller, or a
   32-bit Atmel ARM. Therefore, making an Intelligent Low Cost Eye

Abstract = {{A plenitude of technology is neither developed in-house nor simply
   outsourced in dyadic relationships. Instead, we are in a new age where
   technologies are developed by a networked community of actors and
   organizations, which base their relations dynamically to each other on a
   common interest. Such dynamic and networked complexity of technology
   development is often theoretical explored around the concept of
   platform, and more recently by employing the concept of ecosystem in an
   analogy to natural ecosystems. Following the success of open-source
   software, academics have long been examining openness in digital
   platforms/ecosystems; however most contributions take the perspective of
   a single stakeholder from the many that constitute a digital
   platform/ecosystem. Predominantly, they take the sole perspective of
   platform providers, those bundling hardware and software or more rarely,
   the perspective of third-party software developers developing valuable
   software `apps' that add value to the overall platform. In this
   conceptual article, we grasp openness more holistically, both by
   acknowledging that openness means different things to different people
   and involve all stakeholders within the platforms/ecosystems. Towards
   the development of a theory of openness within digital settings, we
   propose six novel aspects of openness for enabling a greater
   understanding of the open-source software movement with a digital
   platforms/ecosystems perspective. Moreover, we invite scholars to
   reconsider the more predominating product-dominant logic in open-source
   software research to a more holistic logic embracing platforms and
   ecosystem thinking.}},

Abstract = {{The design of sensing systems powered from energy harvesting can be
   complex. Design decisions are required concerning the properties and
   parameters of energy harvesting, conversion, and storage devices. The
   quantity and properties of environmental energy are typically both
   temporally and spatially variant, while the current consumption of the
   load electronics also changes dynamically. In this paper we describe
   Enspect, an open-source hardware/software tool which simplifies the
   design of energy harvesting sensing systems by assisting in the
   specification of harvesting and storage devices. It does this by
   enabling the long-term collection of data on energy availability, and

Abstract = {{Embedded systems that are wirelessly reprogrammed can be rendered
   useless by certain programming errors, excessive power consumption, or
   misconfigurations in the hardware. These types of situations can leave a
   device in a state that compromises its programmability, often rendering
   the device useless. Existing attempts to address the problem of robust
   wireless reprogramming have all been software-based solutions, that are
   vulnerable to certain errors, such as memory corruption, can corrupt the
   recovery programs. We propose a hardware-based solution to wireless
   reprogramming, physically separating the programmer and target device.
   This separation limits the propagation of errors, and ensures the device
   will always be recoverable. In this poster we will present the design
   and an early prototype of our approach -an ultra-low-power, low-cost
   hardware solution to ensure recovery from fatal errors and
   reprogrammability in wireless systems. This poster discusses the current
   system design, initial results, and system analysis from our current
   prototype. We also present future and ongoing directions, as well as key
   research questions. This work was funded by National Science Foundation

Abstract = {{Technological devices of all kinds are becoming more common in our daily
   lives: smart devices are being incorporated in buildings, houses, cars,
   and public infrastructure such as roads and bridges. The new devices
   give us an unusual degree of connectivity in our regular activities, for
   example when we employ our tablets or smart phones to check email or
   browse the public network, but also in more innovative forms of
   connectivity, such as receiving notifications directly from our
   refrigerator or collecting information from our clothes and shoes. This
   technological revolution brings new opportunities and challenges for
   users, businesses, and society. This paper explores such a new context,
   where we begin to co-exist and interact with a network of interconnected
   devices that is known as the Internet of Things. The objective of the
   project is to implement a solution for communicating devices that
   monitor, in real-time, the structural health of a bridge. The
   implementation is based on 6LoWPAN, a standard based on the IPv6
   protocol over low-power and lossy networks to support the Internet of
   Things. We employ open hardware platforms and emphasize the
   singularities of embedded systems, such as a limited number of
   operations, low power consumption, and low bandwidth capability. The
   prototype shown in this work uses the 6LoWPAN standard in a network
   environment that connects with a real Bridge Management System, with the
   aim of optimizing the maintenance of road structures.}},

Abstract = {{The integration of nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into
   microsystems is highly desirable, in order to make use of the unique
   nanomaterial properties in real devices. However, the CNT-to-microsystem
   integration is challenging to implement in a manufacturable,
   cost-effective industrial process. This text presents our work towards a
   process for making complete CMOS/MEMS systems with integrated CNTs. We
   demonstrate the feasibility of the process, using room-temperature
   processing, low-cost equipment and consumables, and electrical control
   with automation possibilities. CNTs are directly integrated at the
   desired positions in the Si microsystem, forming closed Si/CNT/Si
   circuits. An applied electric field during manufacturing ensures that
   the CNTs forming those circuits are well defined, thin and straight. We
   explore different designs with the aim to obtain uniform and
   well-defined CNT synthesis conditions and show that simplified designs
   can perform comparable to more complex ones. The Si/CNT/Si circuits
   obtained can show rectifying (Schottky-like) or near-ohmic behaviour.
   Gas sensing possibilities are demonstrated, indicating the possibility
   of monitoring ageing/fermenting of food. Functionalization of CNTs is
   demonstrated, using thermal evaporation of Sn and Pd, opening for
   selective and sensitive sensors for various gases and analytes. Detailed
   microscopic characterization of the obtained CNTs is presented.}},

Abstract = {{Performance improvements of a single-core processor relying on high
   clock rates reached the limit. Instead of a single-core processor,
   multi-core and many-core processors have been mainstream to accelerate
   applications by parallel processing. Year by year, the number of cores
   integrated in a single chip has been increased due to improvements of
   semiconductor integration technologies depending on Moore's Law. On the
   other hand, Moore's Law will be ended in the near future. This means
   that the approaches relying on the increase in the number of cores will
   be hopeless, thus we have to consider other effective ways. One of them
   is to design application specific hardware. Several research
   organizations have explored it and reported its remarkable findings. We
   focus on such an acceleration approach with dedicated hardware.
   As a case study with dedicated hardware, we present a sorting
   acceleration method. Sorting is an extremely important computation
   kernel that should be accelerated in a lot of fields, such as databases,
   image processing, data compression, etc. We propose a sorting
   accelerator combining Sorting Network and Merge Sorter Tree, and detail
   the design and implementation. Our proposed sorting accelerator is
   customizable, thus designers can implement a sorting accelerator
   composed of required hardware resources by means of tuning design
   parameters. Our experiments show that the proposed hardware achieves up
   to 10.06x sorting performance, compared with Intel Core i7-4770
   operating at 3.4GHz, when sorting 256M 32-bits integer elements. In
   order to allow every designer to easily and freely use this accelerator,
   the RTL source code is released as an open-source hardware.}},

Abstract = {{The Large Scale Antenna System is expected to bring significant
   improvements to overall Communication System Performance. However the
   use of so many antennas in Massive Multiple Inputs Multiple Outputs
   (Massive MIMO) architectures highlights the cost implication of the
   technology. It is therefore possible that Massive MIMO may be deployed
   using low cost equipment to avoid HUGE implementation costs. The use of
   Low Cost Equipment will results into significant Radio Frequency
   Impairments (RF-Impairments) such as Phase Noise, IQ Imbalance and
   Nonlinearities, which will affect the overall system performance. Among
   other aspects channel estimations will also be affected since the signal
   used for these estimations will be affected by the RF-Impairments. This
   paper analyzes a way to exploit correlation during Minimum Mean Square
   Error (MMSE) Channel Estimation of a Massive MIMO System in presence of
   aggregated RF-Impairments (i.e. combined effects of the impairments).
   Specifically it derived the statistical distribution of the equivalent
   aggregated error/noise term using statistical identities and uses the
   derived term to obtain temporal channel estimation error and
   consequently the correlation matrix necessary to minimizes the channel
   Mean Square Error (MSE) of the channel estimate.}},

   and by lowering the economic barriers to students interested in the
   field.
   To do this, the Lab-In-A-Box brings a full powered Digital Signal
   Processor (DSP) core to the popular Arduino microcontroller environment
   and marries it with a simple to use analog front end (AFE). The software
   platform provided with the Lab-In-A-Box includes an Arduino-like
   development environment that facilitates learning and quick development
   of signal processing applications without abstracting away the
   intricacies of a practical implementation. This system has been used to

Abstract = {{In recent years, synthesis of nanoparticles via arc electrical discharge
   method get a lot of interest because this method needs low cost
   equipment and is environmentally friendly. In this study, synthesis of
   titanium-based nanoparticles carried out by direct current (DC) arc
   discharge in different liquids. The purpose of research is investigating
   the effect of liquid medium on size, crystal structure and optical
   properties of synthesized colloidal nanoparticles. Deionized water and
   three different organic liquids including ethanol, methanol and acetone
   were used as arc discharge medium. The arc discharge created with
   applying 40 A current between two pure titanium electrodes immerged in 4
   cm depth of liquid. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and UV-visible
   spectroscopy were used for characterization of size and morphology and
   optical properties of nanoparticles respectively. However the morphology
   of particles is independent of liquid medium and approximately all
   particles are almost spherical but the average size of particles are
   different which among them the colloidal nanoparticles synthesized in
   acetone demonstrate the smallest size. According to optical transmission
   spectra, nanoparticles synthesized in water indicate optical
   characteristic of titanium oxide. Also these colloidal nanoparticles
   sediment after about two days. Colloidal nanoparticles synthesized in
   organic liquids especially acetone demonstrate high stability without
   any sedimentation. In addition, nanoparticles synthesized in ethanol,
   methanol, and acetone indicate optical characteristic of metallic
   nanostructure. Finally water is suitable to formation of titanium oxide
   nanoparticles and acetone is determined as the best medium for
   preparation of stable colloidal solution of titanium nanoparticles. (C)

   OpenMote is a open-hardware prototyping ecosystem designed to accelerate
   the development of the Industrial Internet of Things ( IIoT). It
   features the OpenMote-CC2538, a state-of-the-art computing and
   communication device. This device interfaces with several other
   accessories, or ``skins{''}, through a standardized connector. The skins
   developed to date include boards to provide power, boards which enable a
   developer to easily debug the platform, and boards to allow seamless
   integration of an OpenMote network into the Internet.
   This hardware ecosystem is complemented by a suite of software tools and
   ports to popular open-source IoT implementations. The OpenMote platform
   is for example tailored to run the OpenWSN open-source implementation of
   emerging IIoT standards. The combination of hardware and software
   ecosystems gives an embedded programmer an intuitive and complete
   development environment, and an end-user a fully working low-power
   wireless mesh networking solution running the latest IIoT standards.}},

Abstract = {{Principles of openness and collaboration that catalyze open-source
   software innovation have also been successfully transferred into the

   Raspberry Pi empower people to build cheap, modular, and easy to use
   alternatives to expensive commercial grade scientific equipment. The
   authors argue that the use of open-source hardware in building neuroIS
   research tools will dramatically decrease the costs and complexity
   associated with research in university laboratories. In this work, we
   discuss the use of open-source hardware in neuroIS research. We present
   the design of a neuroIS research tool based on BITalino, a biosignal

Abstract = {{This paper suggests that Mass-Individualization, which is based on a
   consumer product that consists of an open hardware platform and multiple
   modules that are interfaced with the platform, will constitute the next
   paradigm in product design. Customers will be able to adapt the open
   platform to their needs by integrating modules of their choice into the
   platform, thereby constructing individual products that fit their exact
   needs. Large manufacturers will produce the platforms, and small
   companies will invent and produce modules that could be interfaced with
   the open-platform products. Smartphones is an example of an
   open-platform product, and the Apps that are designed to run on
   smartphones are examples for modules. Each customer downloads certain
   Apps that fit his/her needs, thereby creating an individual smartphone.
   The Apps, however, are software modules. The modules that are considered
   in this paper are hardware modules. Open-platform products will create a
   new paradigm in product design and utilization that we call the
   Mass-Individualization paradigm. The Mass-Individualization paradigm
   will boost the economy by (1) creating many new jobs in module
   production companies and (2) increasing the level of sales of consumer
   products. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient parallel execution of scientific and transaction-oriented
   applications requires reducing communication/synchronization overheads
   by improving locality using explicit methods that capturet underlying
   access patterns. In this work, we propose low-cost hardware that
   supports load balancing and parallel broadcast/scatter macro-operations.
   We evaluate these primitives using a cycle-accurate SystemC virtual
   platform of a multicore System-on-Chip (SoC) that interconnects
   cycle-accurate processor models (Cortex-A9) and a memory hierarchy via a
   hypercube Network-on-Chip (NoC). Results from executing a typical
   parallel matrix multiplication benchmark on a small-range embedded
   multicore SoC, indicate average execution time improvements of 25\% for
   load balancing, 21\% for broadcast/scatter primitives and 50\%
   collectively, when utilizing both primitives. While load balancing
   relies only on remote shared-memory access principles, synthesis on
   Zedboard's Zynq 7020 FPGA indicates a very low area cost for scatter
   operation compared to an industrial DMA-based scatter/gather solution.}},

Abstract = {{The number and complexity of control systems in wind turbines (WT) is
   expanding rapidly, and their design can be the difference between an
   immensely profitable system or a damaged system. Designing a robust
   control system requires to test the control algorithms in the actual
   controller hardware. However, WT are large and expensive, thus we would
   like to perform this test virtually, without using prototypes of the WT.
   This work develops a fault diagnosis (FD) and fault tolerant control
   (FTC) of pitch actuators in wind turbines. This is accomplished by
   combining a disturbance compensator with a controller, both of which are
   formulated in the discrete-time domain. The disturbance compensator has
   a dual purpose: to reconstruct the actuator fault (which is used by the
   FD technique) and to design the discrete-time controller to obtain a
   FTC. That is, the actuator faults are reconstructed and then the control
   inputs are modified to achieve a FTC with a comparable behavior to the
   fault-free case. The performance of the FD and FTC schemes is tested in
   a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) testbed for WT controllers. The used
   controller hardware is an open hardware Arduino board which is connected
   to the virtual WT via USB. The onshore 5MW turbine is simulated on the
   open-source National Renewable Energy Laboratory WT simulator FAST
   (Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structures, and Turbulence). The proposed HiL is
   used to characterize the behavior of the WT in the full load region in
   normal operation as well as under fault operation.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, human-computer interfaces have a number of useful
   applications for people. The use of electromyographic signals (EMG) has
   shown to be effective for human-computer interfaces. The classification
   of patterns based on EMG signals has been successfully applied in
   various tasks such as motion detection to control of video games. An
   alternative to increasing access to these applications is the use of
   low-cost hardware to sample the EMG signals considering a real-time
   response. This paper presents a methodology for recognizing patterns of
   EMG signals given by arm movements in real time. Our proposal is based
   on an artificial Neural Network, Multilayer Perceptron, where the EMG
   signals are processed by a set of signal processing techniques. The
   hardware used for obtaining the signal is based on Ag/AgCl connected to
   the EKG/EMG-Shield plate mounted on a Arduino One R3 card which is used
   to control a video game. The implemented application achieves an
   accuracy above 90 \% using less than 0.2 s for recognition of actions in
   time of testing. Our methodology is shown to predict different movements
   of the human arm reliably, at a low cost and in real time.}},

Abstract = {{Electronic controller unit (ECU) used for controlling sub-systems of
   complex real life applications like automotive vehicles can pose several
   challenges. Many times one needs to plan development and testing of
   controller, when the end vehicle is also under development and hence not
   available. In such case, hardware in the loop (HIL) approach for testing
   such controllers emulates the external application environment and
   allows concurrent development of the electronic controllers. Even when
   the end vehicle is available, if design iterations are to be carried out
   using ``in-vehicle{''} testing approach, then the same can be
   time-consuming. Such an approach may also possess safety hazards if
   malfunction of the ECU impacts occupants/vehicle safety. Many cases
   require simulation of a range of use-case scenarios as well as system
   operation under diverse set of environments. For example, for a
   power-train related application various road conditions / road-grades /
   frictional coefficients will have to be simulated. HIL set-up allows us
   to do this on-the-fly.
   This paper describes a case-study of how HIL testing approach was
   gainfully employed for an electronic road-speed limiting application.
   The control system uses an electronic throttle controller as its heart.
   The HIL system can simulate vehicle dynamics for the end vehicle as well
   as road-grade, vehicle load etc. This allowed us rapid development of
   the core control algorithm, which minimized vehicle testing time.
   Another novel feature of this particular testing was, that the HIL
   system was implemented on a low cost hardware based on the target
   controller to be tested. The paper describes the basic scheme in detail
   and also records our experiences/lessons learnt etc.}},

Abstract = {{The Open Compute Project, OCP (http://www.opencompute.org/), was
   launched by Facebook in 2011 with the objective of building efficient
   computing infrastructures at the lowest possible cost. The technologies
   are released as open hardware, with the goal to develop servers and data
   centres following the model traditionally associated with open source
   software projects. In 2013 CERN acquired a few OCP servers in order to
   compare performance and power consumption with standard hardware. The
   conclusions were that there are sufficient savings to motivate an
   attempt to procure a large scale installation. One objective is to
   evaluate if the OCP market is sufficiently mature and broad enough to
   meet the constraints of a public procurement. This paper summarizes this
   procurement, which started in September 2014 and involved the Request
   for information (RFI) to qualify bidders and Request for Tender (RFT).}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The new technology ensures 3D laparoscopic vision by adding
   depth to the traditional two dimensions. This realistic vision gives the
   surgeon the feeling of operating in real space. Hospital of
   Treviglio-Caravaggio isn't an university or scientific institution; in
   2014 a new 3D laparoscopic technology was acquired therefore it led to
   evaluation of the of the appropriateness in term of patient outcome and
   safety. The project aims at achieving the development of a quantitative
   validation model that would ensure low cost and a reliable measure of
   the performance of 3D technology versus 2D mode. In addition, it aims at
   demonstrating how new technologies, such as open source hardware and
   software and 3D printing, could help research with no significant cost
   increase. For these reasons, in order to define criteria of
   appropriateness in the use of 3D technologies, it was decided to perform
   a study to technically validate the use of the best technology in terms
   of effectiveness, efficiency and safety in the use of a system between
   laparoscopic vision in 3D and the traditional 2D.
   METHODS: 30 surgeons were enrolled in order to perform an exercise
   through the use of laparoscopic forceps inside a trainer. The exercise
   consisted of having surgeons with different level of seniority, grouped
   by type of specialization (eg. surgery, urology, gynecology), exercising
   videolaparoscopy with two technologies (2D and 3D) through the use of a
   anthropometric phantom. The target assigned to the surgeon was that to
   pass ``needle and thread{''} without touching the metal part in the
   shortest time possible. The rings selected for the exercise had each a
   coefficient of difficulty determined by depth, diameter, angle from the
   positioning and from the point of view.
   RESULTS: The analysis of the data collected from the above exercise has
   mathematically confirmed that the 3D technique ensures a learning curve
   lower in novice and greater accuracy in the performance of the task with
   respect to 2D.}},

Abstract = {{In ultrafast ultrasound imaging technique, how to maintain the high
   frame rate, and at the same time to improve the image quality as far as
   possible, has become a significant issue. Several novel beamforming
   methods based on compressive sensing (CS) theory have been proposed in
   previous literatures, but all have their own limitations, such as the
   excessively large memory consumption and the errors caused by the
   short-time discrete Fourier transform (STDFT). In this study, a novel
   CS-based time-domain beamformer for plane-wave ultrasound imaging is
   proposed and its image quality has been verified to be better than the
   traditional DAS method and even the popular coherent compounding method
   on several simulated phantoms. Comparing to the existing CS method, the
   memory consumption of our method is significantly reduced since the
   encoding matrix can be sparse-expressed. In addition, the time-delay
   calculations of the echo signals are directly accomplished in
   time-domain with a dictionary concept, avoiding the errors induced by
   the short-time Fourier translation calculation in those frequency-domain
   methods. The proposed method can be easily implemented on some low-cost
   hardware platforms, and can obtain ultrasound images with both high
   frame rate and good image quality, which make it has a great potential
   for clinical application.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing availability of low-cost hardware along with the rapid
   growth of wireless devices has enabled the development of Wireless
   Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSNs). Multimedia content such as video and
   audio streaming is transmitted over a WMSN which can easily be deployed
   with low cost. However, enabling real-time data applications in those
   networks demands not only Quality of Service (QoS) awareness, but also
   efficient energy management. Sensor network devices have limited energy
   resources. The limited energy poses significant threats on the QoS of
   WMSNs. In this paper, to improve the efficiency of QoS-aware routing, we
   examine an angle-based QoS and energy-aware dynamic routing scheme
   designed for WMSNs. The proposed approach uses the inclination angle and
   the transmission distance between nodes to optimize the selection of the
   forwarding candidate set and extend network lifetime. Simulation results
   indicate that considerable lifetime values can be achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the rapid change in cellular technologies, Mobile Network
   Operators (MNOs) keep a high percentage of their deployed infrastructure
   using Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) technologies. With
   about 3.5 billion subscribers, GSM remains as the de facto standard for
   cellular communications. However, the security criteria envisioned 30
   years ago, when the standard was designed, are no longer sufficient to
   ensure the security and privacy of the users. Furthermore, even with the
   newest fourth generation (4G) cellular technologies starting to be
   deployed, these networks could never achieve strong security guarantees
   because the MNOs keep backwards-compatibility given the huge amount of
   GSM subscribers. In this paper, we present and describe the tools and
   necessary steps to perform an active attack against a GSM-compatible
   network, by exploiting the GSM protocol lack of mutual authentication
   between the subscribers and the network. The attack consists of a
   so-called man-in-the-middle attack implementation. By using Software
   Defined Radio (SDR), open-source libraries and open-source hardware, we
   setup a fake GSM base station to impersonate the network and therefore
   eavesdrop any communications that are being routed through it and
   extract information from their victims. Finally, we point out some
   implications of the protocol vulnerabilities and how these can not be
   mitigated in the short term since 4G deployments will take long time to
   entirely replace the current GSM infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the adoption of an open source hardware release
   process for a wearable headlamp as a way to improve prototyping and
   promote regionally-appropriate technology. The headlamp has been
   developed to satisfy a communicated need for hands-free, directional
   lighting that can he charged with renewable energy technology in remote
   areas that lack reliable electricity. The design of the headlamp
   emphasizes the importance of built-in resilience as way to achieve
   durability. Utilizing a highly-adaptable mechanical design accompanied
   with guiding design principles enables the headlamp to he implemented in
   an unlimited number of locations; during manufacture, the product will
   be embedded with locally-appropriate features that complement the
   materials and skills available in the region. Releasing the product with
   an open source hardware license fosters product adaptation for the
   design, manufacture, and use of the headlamp in various locations.
   Working prototypes have been developed, and kits are available under the
   IEEE open-source hardware license.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber Security classes are not offered in many colleges and fewer high
   schools, the main reason is that there are not enough resources in terms
   of both expertise and equipment for them to start a Cyber Security
   education program. We are seeking to reduce the overhead cost for
   offering such classes by developing a system that is cloud-based which
   will enable students to participate in labs from their school while only
   needing an internet connection and low-end computers. We are in the
   process of developing such a cloud system at the University of
   Washington Bothell and the tool that will generate a working network on
   the fly with either a probabilistic model or the specific instructions
   from the user via a network description language. These dynamically
   generated systems will then be instantiated on the cloud system along
   with progress monitoring applications that will determine when the
   student has completed the scenario. Since all of the heavy processing is
   done on the cloud-side, the school offering such a class only needs to
   have very basic, low-cost hardware to connect to the remote system,
   deploy the scenario, and participate in the scenario. We are currently
   working with the Yakama Nation to deploy a lab for their students to
   utilize our system. We will initially begin by holding cyber security
   workshops for the students and then, pending positive results, move to a
   more regular class-like format, these classes will be designed around
   teaching through interaction and hands on experience rather than the
   formal lecture style to help cultivate the ability to think outside the
   box which is much needed from todays security.}},

   evolution at the metal surface during the hardening process. In
   addition, its impact is examined by measurement of the hardness of the
   work piece made out of 1038h (AISI/SAE). Further, an efficient digital
   control technique was designed, implemented and integrated into the
   induction heating system in the range of 1kW power range, at an
   operating frequency of 6.4 to 7.1 kHz. Its features are flexibility, low

   brain-computer interfaces and for training purposes. In the current
   study we examine multi-session training in a P3 speller application

   word a participant is attempting to spell. Because neurofeedback
   training is most effective over time, there is an advantage to using
   low-cost hardware that can be used in the home rather than expensive
   research-grade equipment. This study is performed on an Emotiv Epoc EEG
   headset and some of the problems and workarounds inherent in this are
   discussed. This headset is sensitive enough to detect evoked response
   potentials and evidence of a training effect is found. Motivational
   aspects of ERP training are discussed and an alternate P300 training

Abstract = {{In this article, we show the development of a low-cost hardware/software
   system based on close range photogrammetry to track the movement of a
   person performing weightlifting. The goal is to reduce the costs to the
   trainers and athletes dedicated to this sport when it comes to analyze
   the performance of the sportsman and avoid injuries or accidents. We
   used a web-cam as the data acquisition hardware and develop the software
   stack in Processing using the OpenCV library. Our algorithm extracts
   size, position, velocity, and acceleration measurements of the bar along
   the course of the exercise. We present detailed characteristics of the
   system with their results in a controlled setting. The current work
   improves the detection and tracking capabilities from a previous version
   of this system by using HSV color model instead of RGB. Preliminary
   results show that the system is able to profile the movement of the bar
   as well as determine the size, position, velocity, and acceleration
   values of a marker/target in scene. The average error finding the size
   of object at four meters of distance is less than 4\%, and the error of
   the acceleration value is 1.01\% in average.}},

Abstract = {{Coherent compounding method for plane-wave ultrasound imaging has been
   widely used in many frontier research areas. However, it still needs to
   find a compromise between the frame rate and image quality, which
   restricts its wider implementation. How to maintain the high frame rate
   and improve the image quality at the same time, has become a significant
   issue on plane-wave imaging technique. Although several methods based on
   compressive sensing (CS) have been proposed in previous studies, they
   still have some limitations, especially on the memory occupation and the
   amount of computation. In this paper, a novel CS-based beamforming
   method used for plane-wave ultrasound imaging is proposed and its image
   quality has been verified on several simulated phantoms. In this method,
   only the relationship between the time-delay information and the spatial
   distribution of the scatterers is considered when establishing the
   encoding matrix. In addition, the encoding matrix is expressed totally
   in time-domain with a dictionary-searching concept, and can be
   sparse-expressed with very low memory occupation. The imaging results
   have been compared with the traditional DAS method and the coherent
   compounding method. The image quality of CS method has been verified to
   be better than the traditional DAS method and even the coherent
   compounding method. The proposed method can be easily implemented on
   some low-cost hardware platforms, and can obtain ultrasound images with
   both high frame rate and good image quality, which make it has a great
   potential for clinical application.}},

Abstract = {{The great usefulness of remote recording of biomedical signals in most
   aspects of daily life has generated an increasing interest in this
   field. Traditionally, monitoring devices from clinical enviroments are
   bulky, intrusive, and expensive. Thus, the development of wearable,
   mobile, and low-cost applications is desirable. Nevertheless, recent
   improvements in open-hardware allow developing low cost devices and
   portable designs for biosignal monitoring in out-of-lab applications,
   such as sports, leisure, e-Health, etc. This paper presents a low-cost
   wearable system able to simultaneously record electrical brain and heart
   activity (i.e. electroencephalography and electrocardiography). The
   system is able to send biomedical data to a platform for remote
   analyses. Both software and hardware are open-source. We assessed the
   system for its validity and reliability in a real road environment.}},

   interconnection. One of DPB's functions is synchronization of Front End
   Electronics (FEE). To provide this functionality, it is necessary to
   receive the reference clock and timing signals from the Timing and Flow
   Control system. The received clock after the jitter cleaning will be
   used as a reference clock for GBT-FPGA based 4.8 Gbps links used for

Title = {{A Systematic Hardware Sharing Method for Unified Architecture Design of
   H.264 Transforms}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Multitransform techniques have been widely used in modern video coding
   and have better compression efficiency than the single transform
   technique that is used conventionally. However, every transform needs a
   corresponding hardware implementation, which results in a high hardware
   cost for multiple transforms. A novel method that includes a five-step
   operation sharing synthesis and architecture-unification techniques is
   proposed to systematically share the hardware and reduce the cost of
   multitransform coding. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   method, a unified architecture is designed using the method for all of
   the six transforms involved in the H.264 video codec: 2D 4 x 4 forward
   and inverse integer transforms, 2D 4 x 4 and 2 x 2 Hadamard transforms,
   and 1D 8 x 8 forward and inverse integer transforms. Firstly, the six H.
   264 transform architectures are designed at a low cost using the
   proposed five-step operation sharing synthesis technique. Secondly, the
   proposed architecture-unification technique further unifies these six
   transform architectures into a low cost hardware-unified architecture.
   The unified architecture requires only 28 adders, 16 subtractors, 40
   shifters, and a proposed mux-based routing network, and the gate count
   is only 16308. The unified architecture processes 8 pixels/clock-cycle,
   up to 275 MHz, which is equal to 707 Full-HD 1080 p frames/second.}},

Abstract = {{One of the major challenges within Optical Imaging, photon propagation
   through clear layers embedded between scattering tissues, can be now
   efficiently modelled in real-time thanks to the Monte Carlo approach
   based on GPU. Because of its nature, the photon propagation problem can
   be very easily parallelized and ran on low cost hardware, avoiding the
   need for expensive Super Computers. A comparison between Diffusion and
   MC photon propagation theory is presented in this work with application
   to neuroimaging, investigating low scattering regions in a mouse-like
   phantom. Regions such as the Cerebral Spinal Fluid, are currently not
   taken into account in the classical computational models because of the
   impossibility to accurately simulate light propagation using fast
   Diffusive Equation approaches, leading to inaccuracies during the
   reconstruction process. The goal of the study presented here, is to
   reduce and further improve the computation accuracy of the reconstructed
   solution in a highly realistic scenario in the case of neuroimaging in
   preclinical mouse models.}},

Abstract = {{Photographic documentation and image-based wound assessment is
   frequently performed in medical diagnostics, patient care, and clinical
   research. To support quantitative assessment, photographic imaging is
   based on expensive and high-quality hardware and still needs appropriate
   registration and calibration. Using inexpensive consumer hardware such
   as smartphone-integrated cameras, calibration of geometry, color, and
   contrast is challenging. Some methods involve color calibration using a
   reference pattern such as a standard color card, which is located
   manually in the photographs. In this paper, we adopt the lattice
   detection algorithm by Park et al. from real world to medicine. At
   first, the algorithm extracts and clusters feature points according to
   their local intensity patterns. Groups of similar points are fed into a
   selection process, which tests for suitability as a lattice grid. The
   group which describes the largest probability of the meshes of a lattice
   is selected and from it a template for an initial lattice cell is
   extracted. Then, a Markov random field is modeled. Using the mean-shift
   belief propagation, the detection of the 2D lattice is solved
   iteratively as a spatial tracking problem. Least-squares geometric
   calibration of projective distortions and non-linear color calibration
   in RGB space is supported by 35 corner points of 24 color patches,
   respectively. The method is tested on 37 photographs taken from the
   German Calciphylaxis registry, where non-standardized photographic
   documentation is collected nationwide from all contributing trial sites.
   In all images, the reference card location is correctly identified. At
   least, 28 out of 35 lattice points were detected, outperforming the
   SIFT-based approach previously applied. Based on these coordinates,
   robust geometry and color registration is performed making the
   photographs comparable for quantitative analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Current state of the art's real time monitoring of fresh produce,
   provides only temperature and humidity information {[}1-3]. The idea is
   to develop new sensors and transport service assisted by ICT platform to
   monitor fresh produce quality. The technology will be based on radio
   frequency (RF) wireless network, and will provide real-time and in-site
   data-logging, enabling active management of food products in storage and
   transit. The RF sensor network design, allows an auxiliary sensor node
   to be ``plugged in{''}. In this contribution we present the commercial
   platform developed starting from o fork of open hardware on which we
   assemble an array of commercial sensors in an ``open air{''}
   configuration. We developed for this Embedded Gas Sensor System Device
   (Tinynose) two set-up: the ``Development set-up{''} that uses a star
   wireless network infrastructure to store all raw sensor output and
   associated measurement error in a server DB to define parameters in
   ripening mathematical model and the ``TAG set-up{''} that performs
   ripening evaluation in ICT in-site platform.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous models are published integrating produce respiration data and
   gas transmission properties for packaging material in order to predict
   the optimal equilibrium headspace gas atmosphere. Gaining the data
   needed for input in the models can be cumbersome, and data found in
   literature are often given in different units and not stated at the
   desired storage conditions, e.g., gas transmission rates are usually
   measured at 23 degrees C. Respiration data might also show great
   variation due to variety, quality and season, and literature data cannot
   automatically be transferred to own products. In this work a procedure
   for measuring produce respiration rates and gas transmission rate of the
   whole package is outlined. The respiration measurements are performed
   using low cost equipment and commercial packages as respiration
   chambers. The obtained results from the measurements for tested products
   were found to be in accordance with respiration data found in
   literature. The O-2 and CO2 transmission rates of the whole packages
   were measured by a static method using a low cost gas analyser. The
   method can be used for packages with and without perforations, and it
   was also possible, within an acceptable accuracy, to calculate the
   transmission rate for a single hole. The respiration rates were measured
   at low and abused temperature (2 and 6 degrees C for plums and 5 and 10
   degrees C for broccoli). Gas transmission rates of the packages were
   measured at 5, 10 and 23 degrees C. Finally, a simple predictive model
   integrating produce respiration rates and gas transmission rate data for
   the whole package was developed. The modelled data were shown to be in
   accordance with empirical measurements for plums (Prunus domestica L.)
   packaged in laser-perforated pouches and for broccoli florets (Brassica
   oleracea) in sealed trays. The described procedure using low cost
   equipment and commercial packages is an alternative method for
   laboratories, packaging material producers, farmers and packaging houses
   to optimize their packages based on own measurements under realistic
   storage temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) as an infrastructure comprised of
   sensing, computing and communication elements are designed for the
   decentralized recording of environmental information. If the matter of
   concern is referenced geospatial information this in particular forms a
   Geo Sensor Network (GSN).
   Recently there is an ongoing extensive impact of these new techniques on
   all geo sciences, whereby it depends on the application which demands
   with respect to data quality, size and costs of the sensor nodes, number
   of nodes in the network, requirements of the communication component
   (coverage, data throughput) and the power management are relevant. In
   Engineering Geodesy the new possibilities and new ideas emerging from
   GSN especially concern geo(detic) monitoring of objects like landslides
   or engineering construction sites. Theory and possibilities of GSN
   technology as well as some selected aspects for geo monitoring in
   particular will be discussed. As the early detection of already small
   variations is essential for Early Warning Systems (EWS) and risk
   management, data quality and reliability is of utmost importance. Thus,
   customary utilization of low cost equipment in such a GSN generally
   requires for calibration procedures and higher sophisticated evaluation

Abstract = {{The paper is focused on the building ad-hoc GSM network based on open
   source software and low-cost hardware. The created Base Transmission
   Station can be deployed and put into operation in a few minutes in a
   required area to ensure private communication between connected GSM
   mobile terminals. The convergence between BTS station and the other
   networks is possible through IP network. The paper tries to define
   connection parameters to provide sufficient quality of voice service
   between the GSM network and IP Multimedia Subsystem. The paper brings
   practical results of voice call quality measurement between users inside
   BTS station mobile network and users inside IP Multimedia Subsystem
   network. The calls are simulated by low-cost embedded solution for
   speech quality measurement in GSM network. This tool is under
   development of our laboratory and allows automatic speech quality
   measurement of any GSM or UMTS mobile network. The Perceptual Evaluation
   of Speech Quality method is used to get final comparable results. The
   communication between BTS station and connected networks has to be
   secured against the interception from the third party. The influence of
   the securing method for quality of service is presented in detail.
   Paper, apart from the quality of service measurement section, describes
   technical requirements for successful interconnection between BTS and
   IMS networks. The authentication, authorization and accounting methods
   in roaming between BTS and IMS system are presented too.}},

Abstract = {{A method using different light sources and sensors have already been
   used to approximate weighting functions to calculate light transmittance
   in sunglasses. Although it made possible a low cost equipment that
   inform the user about its sunglasses, each transmittance test is still
   dependent of its components. We tested two methods, using polynomial
   approximation and artificial neural network, that would open the
   possibility for the use of a fixed light source and sensor for all light
   transmittance tests from the standard. Spectrophotometry, visible
   transmittance and traffic light transmittance was calculated in 45
   lenses of sunglasses, used as samples for testing the methodologies. The
   tests included a white LED, a RGB sensor, and electronic for control and
   signal acquisition. Bland - Altman analysis tool was used to calculate
   the agreement between the method and the transmittances calculated in
   the spectrophotometer. Both methods, had an approximation within the
   deviation limit required by NBR15111. The system with the polynomial
   regression showed lower deviations than artificial neural networks. A
   larger number of samples can improve the methods in order to obtain an
   optimal calibration that includes all sunglasses. No meter in the market
   can calculate accurately all light transmittances measurements required
   for the sunglasses. The methodology was applied only for the visible
   light, while UV and infrared spectrum remains to be tested. The
   methodology tested presented a way for simple low-cost equipment for all
   light transmittance tests in sunglasses}},

Journal = {{HISTORY OF GEO- AND SPACE SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{3-22}},
Abstract = {{In the physics of the upper atmosphere the solar extreme ultraviolet
   (EUV) radiation plays a dominant role controlling most of the
   thermospheric/ionospheric (T/I) processes. Since this part of the solar
   spectrum is absorbed in the thermosphere, platforms to measure the EUV
   fluxes became only available with the development of rockets reaching
   altitude levels exceeding 80 km. With the availability of V2 rockets
   used in space research, recording of EUV spectra started in 1946 using
   photographic films. The development of pointing devices to accurately
   orient the spectrographs toward the sun initiated intense activities in
   solar-terrestrial research. The application of photoelectric recording
   technology enabled the scientists placing EUV spectrometers aboard
   satellites observing qualitatively strong variability of the solar EUV
   irradiance on short-, medium-, and long-term scales. However, as more
   measurements were performed more radiometric EUV data diverged due to
   the inherent degradation of the EUV instruments with time. Also,
   continuous recording of the EUV energy input to the T/I system was not
   achieved. It is only at the end of the last century that there was
   progress made in solving the serious problem of degradation enabling to
   monitore solar EUV fluxes with sufficient radiometric accuracy. The data
   sets available allow composing the data available to the first set of
   EUV data covering a period of 11 years for the first time. Based on the
   sophisticated instrumentation verified in space, future EUV measurements
   of the solar spectral irradiance (SSI) are promising accuracy levels of
   about 5\% and less. With added low-cost equipment, real-time
   measurements will allow providing data needed in ionospheric modeling,
   e.g., for correcting propagation delays of navigation signals from space
   to earth. Adding EUV airglow and auroral emission monitoring by airglow
   cameras, the impact of space weather on the terrestrial T/I system can
   be studied with a spectral terrestrial irradiance camera (STI-Cam) and
   also be used investigating real-time space weather effects and deriving
   more detailed correction procedures for the evaluation of Global
   Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals. Progress in physics goes
   with achieving higher accuracy in measurements. This review historically
   guides the reader on the ways of exploring the impact of the variable
   solar radiation in the extreme ultraviolet spectral region on our upper
   atmosphere in the altitude regime from 80 to 1000 km.}},

Abstract = {{Safety-critical systems and certification standards are the bare
   essential elements for the development process of avionics, automotive
   and industrial embedded systems. The necessity of including non-safety
   capabilities to reduce the price of these systems has resulted in a new
   type of critical systems, the mixed-criticality ones. These systems
   should be able to execute safety-critical applications but, at the same
   time, to run non-safety-critical functionalities without affecting the
   integrity of the safetycritical tasks. This paper presents a new system
   architecture which includes safetycritical and non-safety-critical parts
   in order to form a mixed-criticality system. The system consists of a
   reliable platform with a dual-core processor (implemented using a FPGA)
   architecture designed as open-hardware, running two isolated real-time
   operating systems which are connected through a safe core-to-core
   communication channel that executes the safety-critical applications.
   Moreover, the safety-critical system is connected to an external
   processor, an ARM9, which is used as an external sensing system. The
   ARM9 runs the non-safety-critical applications and allows the system to
   insert modifications updating without affecting the safety capabilities
   of the safetycritical part. This platform is described providing
   evidences of the isolation between safety-critical (SC) and
   non-safety-critical (NSC) applications, as well as describing an
   updating methodology for non-safety-critical applications. This system
   is validated using a complete and reliable application for safe
   emergency stop applications for industrial machinery.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we show that magnetic nanowires with weak magnetic fields
   and low frequencies can induce cell death via a mechanism that does not
   involve heat production. We incubated colon cancer cells with two
   concentrations (2.4 and 12 mu g/mL) of nickel nanowires that were 35 nm
   in diameter and exposed the cells and nanowires to an alternating
   magnetic field (0.5 mT and 1 Hz or 1 kHz) for 10 or 30 minutes. This
   low-power field exerted a force on the magnetic nanowires, causing a
   mechanical disturbance to the cells. Transmission electron microscopy
   images showed that the nanostructures were internalized into the cells
   within 1 hour of incubation. Cell viability studies showed that the
   magnetic field and the nanowires separately had minor deleterious
   effects on the cells; however, when combined, the magnetic field and
   nanowires caused the cell viability values to drop by up to 39\%,
   depending on the strength of the magnetic field and the concentration of
   the nanowires. Cell membrane leakage experiments indicated membrane
   leakage of 20\%, suggesting that cell death mechanisms induced by the
   nanowires and magnetic field involve some cell membrane rupture. Results
   suggest that magnetic nanowires can kill cancer cells. The proposed
   process requires simple and low-cost equipment with exposure to only
   very weak magnetic fields for short time periods.}},

Title = {{Combined application of FBG and PZT sensors for plantar pressure
   monitoring at low and high speed walking}},
Journal = {{TECHNOLOGY AND HEALTH CARE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{47-61}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Clinical monitoring of planar pressure is vital in several
   pathological conditions, such as diabetes, where excess pressure might
   have serious repercussions on health of the patient, even to the extent
   of amputation.
   OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this paper is to experimentally
   evaluate the combined application of the Fibre Bragg Grating (FBG) and
   the lead zirconate titanate (PZT) piezoceramic sensors for plantar
   pressure monitoring during walk at low and high speeds.
   METHODS: For fabrication of the pressure sensors, the FBGs are embedded
   within layers of carbon composite material and stacked in an arc shape.
   From this embedding technique, average pressure sensitivity of 1.3
   pm/kPa and resolution of nearly 0.8 kPa is obtained. These sensors are
   found to be suitable for measuring the static and the low-speed walk
   generated foot pressure. Simultaneously, PZT patches of size 10 x 10 x
   0.3 mm were used as sensors, utilizing the d(33) (thickness) coupling
   mode. A sensitivity of 7.06 mV/kPa and a pressure resolution of 0.14 kPa
   is obtained from these sensors, which are found to be suitable for foot
   pressure measurement during high speed walking and running. Both types
   of sensors are attached to the underside of the sole of commercially
   available shoes. In the experiments, a healthy male subject walks/runs
   over the treadmill wearing the fabricated shoes at various speeds and
   the peak pressure is measured using both the sensors. Commercially
   available low-cost hardware is used for interrogation of the two sensor
   types.
   RESULTS: The test results clearly show the feasibility of the FBG and
   the PZT sensors for measurement of plantar pressure. The PZT sensors are
   more accurate for measurement of pressure during walking at high speeds.
   The FBG sensors, on the other hand, are found to be suitable for static
   and quasi-dynamic (slow walking) conditions. Typically, the measured
   pressure varied from 400 to 600 kPa below the forefoot and 100 to 1000
   kPa below the heel as the walking speed varied from 1 kilometer per hour
   (kmph) to 7 kmph.
   CONCLUSIONS: When instrumented in combination, the two sensors can
   enable measurements ranging from static to high speed conditions Both
   the sensor types are rugged, small sized and can be easily embedded in
   commercial shoes and enable plantar pressure measurement in a
   cost-effective manner. This research is expected to have application in
   the treatment of patients suffering from diabetes and gonarthrosis.}},

Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{In this article we propose a new algorithm for time synchronization in
   wireless sensor networks. The algorithm is based on linear regression to
   achieve long-term synchronization between the clocks of different
   network motes. Since motes are built using low-cost hardware components,
   usually their internal local clocks are not very accurate. In addition,
   there are other effects that affect the clock precision, such as:
   environmental conditions, supply voltage, aging, manufacturing process.
   Because some of these causes are external and unpredictable, the clock
   drift between two motes can change in a random way. Due to these
   changes, the optimum time window used for performing the linear
   regression varies with time. The proposed time synchronization algorithm
   adjusts the resynchronization periods and the linear regression window
   size to these variations, minimizing the synchronization error. Our
   algorithm has been tested in real multihop network deployments and the
   results obtained show higher clock accuracy when compared to the related
   work. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Direct-conversion radio receivers can offer highly integrated low-cost
   hardware solutions for spectrum sensing in cognitive radio systems.
   However, these receivers are susceptible to radio frequency (RF)
   impairments, such as in-phase and quadrature-phase imbalance, low-noise
   amplifier nonlinearities and phase noise, which limit the spectrum
   sensing capabilities. In this paper, we study the joint effects of RF
   impairments on energy detection based spectrum sensing in multi-channel
   environments. In particular, we provide an analytical framework for the
   evaluation of the probabilities of detection and false alarm, assuming
   Rayleigh fading and approximating the joint effects of RF impairments by
   a Gaussian distribution. Numerical results illustrate the detrimental
   effects of RF imperfections on the spectrum sensing performance, which
   bring significant losses in the spectrum utilization.}},

   First, we summarize the range of current practices in wireless sensor
   network research projects by analyzing recent contributions in the
   literature. Specifically, for each wireless sensor network project, we
   compile details regarding the scope (e.g., simulation, testbed, real
   deployment), the type of mote used (e.g., TinyOS, Android, Arduino), and
   the type of sensors used (e.g., inertial, biological).
   Next, we discuss reasons why Arduino based wireless devices are perhaps
   the future of applied wireless sensor network research. Arduino-based
   systems are inexpensive, easy to use, readily available, well
   documented, 100\% open-source (hardware and software), object oriented,
   extendable (using the ``shield{''} concept), and flexible (e.g., in
   terms of radio choices). Lastly, we discuss the pros and cons of
   interdisciplinary research; that is, we highlight the struggle between
   working on difficult, relevant, inherently multi-disciplinary research
   problems while maintaining scholarship in individual fields.}},

Abstract = {{From the early days, images are being generally accepted as a proof of
   occurrence of the past events. The availability of low cost hardware and
   software tools, makes easy to create and manipulate digital images with
   no obvious traces. This has led to the situation where one can no longer
   take the integrity and authenticity of the digital images for granted.
   In many cases, the images are copied from one image to another image to
   form the composite image called splicing. This is done by various image
   editing softwares like photoshop, GIMP etc. So, the spliced images arc
   under scan and need to be tested for its authenticity. In this regard,
   image feature extraction based classifiers like K Nearest Neigbor(KNN),
   Fuzzy Logic and Support Vector Machine(SVM) are used for identification
   of spliced images. In the first step, features are extracted from the
   Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM). The extracted features are fed
   to the KNN, Fuzzy and SVM classifiers. Based on the Accuracy parameter
   obtained from each of the classifier, the comparative analysis of the
   classifiers is performed.}},

Abstract = {{Location-awareness is one of the major challenges in wireless sensor
   networks (WSNs) today. Received signal strength indicator (RSSI)-based
   localization techniques are a promising approach to provide location
   information in WSNs utilizing low-cost hardware. In this paper, the
   performance of RSSI-based direction-of-arrival (DOA) is assessed.
   Therefore, the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for direction estimation
   with RSSI measurements is derived in an analytical form. Furthermore, a
   position CRLB RSSI-based DOA estimates is presented. Since RSSI-based
   DOA is highly dependent on the direction of the received signal, and
   hence position estimates are, the network topology has a major impact on
   the feasible precision of the locating system. A methodology is shown to
   find the optimal WSN topology evaluating the position CRLB for
   RSSI-based DOA measurements.}},

   e., the Crazyflie nano quadrotor, by adding the guidance, navigation and
   control layers required to accomplish autonomous flight. The control
   layer, in particular, is based on a cascade control algorithm able to
   globally stabilize the position and the attitude of the vehicle. The
   global property guaranteed by the algorithm allows the quadrotors to
   perform aggressive maneuvers. The guidance layer is designed to
   coordinate simultaneously multiple vehicles by generating suitable
   reference trajectories. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed design.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, customized AT software solutions allow their users to interact
   with various kinds of computer systems. Such tools are generally
   available on personal devices (e.g., smartphones, laptops and so on)
   commonly used by a person with a disability. In this paper, we
   investigate a way of using the aforementioned AT equipments in order to
   access many different devices without assistive preferences. The
   solution takes advantage of open source hardware and its core component
   consists of an affordable Linux embedded system: it grabs data coming
   from the assistive software, which runs on the user's personal device,
   then, after processing, it generates native keyboard and mouse HID
   commands for the target computing device controlled by the end user.
   This process supports any operating system available on the target
   machine and it requires no specialized software installation; therefore
   the user with a disability can rely on a single assistive tool to
   control a wide range of computing platforms, including conventional
   computers and many kinds of mobile devices, which receive input commands
   through the USB HID protocol.}},

   context, we developed ARTerial Stiffness Evaluation for Noninvasive
   Screening (ARTSENS), a device for image free, noninvasive, automated
   evaluation of vascular stiffness amenable for field use. ARTSENS has a
   frugal hardware design, utilizing a single ultrasound transducer to
   interrogate the carotid artery, integrated with robust algorithms that
   extract arterial dimensions and compute clinically accepted measures of
   arterial stiffness. The ability of ARTSENS to measure vascular stiffness
   in vivo was validated by performing measurements on 125 subjects. The
   accuracy of results was verified with the state-ofthe-art ultrasound
   imaging-based echo-tracking system. The relation between arterial
   stiffness measurements performed in sitting posture for ARTSENS
   measurement and sitting/supine postures for imaging system was also
   investigated to examine feasibility of performing ARTSENS measurements
   in the sitting posture for field deployment. This paper verified the
   feasibility of the novel ARTSENS device in performing accurate in vivo
   measurements of arterial stiffness. As a portable device that performs
   automated measurement of carotid artery stiffness with minimal operator
   input, ARTSENS has strong potential for use in large-scale screening.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the composition for a comprehensive RFID (radio
   frequency identification) laboratory tutorial with cheap devices and
   license free software tools. It consists of three different units which
   take approximately four hours each. The prerequisite knowledge of the
   students should be on a basic level of bachelor in electrical or
   telecommunication engineering. But with some simplifications the
   laboratory tasks can also be performed in high schools as practical
   assistance in the informatics and physics lessons.
   The required devices are a cheap and small RFID reader operating in the
   high frequency range together with a small number of RFID transponders.
   The second device is a simple computer with free mathematics software
   packages. In this work the software GNU Octave or Matlab can be used and
   enables all necessary steps for automated calculations of RFID typical
   signals. Finally, an oscilloscope would complete the equipment set, but
   there are cheaper alternatives by using USB-scopes including software
   drivers and with usually free signal acquisition programs.
   The presented laboratory setup can be used in every RFID related lecture
   even in education institutions with small budget for equipment
   investments. Due to the low cost character, it is also possible to hand
   out the components to every interested student for solving the homework
   or to motivate to further RFID investigations.}},

Abstract = {{With the development of sensor, wireless mobile communication, embedded
   system and cloud computing, the technologies of Internet of Things (IOT)
   have been widely used in logistics, Smart Meter, public security,
   intelligent building and so on. The Internet of Things is regarded as
   the third wave of information technology after Internet and mobile
   communication network, which is characterized by more thorough sense and
   measure, more comprehensive inter operability and intelligence. Wireless
   Sensor Networks (WSN) is one of the most important building block for
   the IOT. It also have recently been in the limelight for many domains.
   WSN are useful in data collection, event detection or entity tracking
   applications. The characteristics of sensor networks have imposed
   various restrictions on their system designs. Since sensor nodes usually
   are developed by low-cost hardware, one major challenge in the
   development of many sensor-network applications is to provide
   high-security features with limited resources. In this paper, we propose
   a path generation framework with deadline considerations for real-time
   query processing. To meet the deadline, the framework will assign the
   time budget to the routing path, and then, derive a feasible path with
   the assigned time budget. To derive the optimal assignment of time
   budgets, this propose DP-base algorithms to solve this problem.}},

Abstract = {{The need for low-cost health monitoring is increasing with the
   continuous increase of the elderly population. In this context,
   unobtrusive audiovisual monitoring methods can be of great importance.
   More particularly, the diameter of the pupil is a valuable source of
   information, since, apart from pathological cases, it can reveal the
   emotional state, the fatigue and the ageing. To allow for unobtrusive
   monitoring to gain acceptance, one should seek for efficient methods of
   monitoring using common low-cost hardware. This paper describes a method
   for monitoring pupil sizes using a common, low-cost web camera in real
   time. The proposed approach detects the face and the eyes area at first
   stage. Subsequently, optimal iris and sclera location and radius,
   modeled as ellipses, are found using efficient spatial filtering. As a
   final step, the pupil center and radius is estimated by optimal
   filtering within the area of the iris. Experimental results show both
   the efficiency and the effectiveness of our approach.}},

   results showed that with decreasing fixed point resolution from 16 bits
   down to 6 bits, the average classification error for the TEO increases
   from 0.0\% to 6.6\%. At 8 bit resolution, the error was an acceptable
   2.4\%, which implies that the TEO can be efficiently calculated using

   performing also Holter, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and
   retinography analysis- and 48 ambulances in the north of the state, as
   part of a myocardial infarction system of care. Using low-cost equipment
   and simple technology, TNMG has employed various strategies to increase
   telehealth use. The number of ECGs performed by TNMG has progressively
   increased. It was expected to achieve 2 million in February 2015. The
   utilization rates were around 90\%. It proved to be economically sound,
   promoting savings of 45M USD for an investment of 10.2M USD. It is
   currently a regular health service in the state, integrated into the

Abstract = {{This chapter examines the use of Open Source Software (OSS) technologies
   that can be used to improve the learning of Science, Technology,
   Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). Explored are the various methods
   that can be utilized to improve the percentage of STEM majors in the
   American educational system with resources such as: Open Source as
   Alternative (OSALT), virtualization, cloud computing, Linux
   distributions, open source programming, and open source hardware
   platforms. Increasing the amount of students that pursue STEM majors is
   important because the projected job growth in the STEM field compared to
   non-STEM jobs is 33\%. OSALT provides cost-effective alternatives to
   commercial products such as Microsoft Office Suite and Adobe Photoshop.
   Second, creating Virtual Machines (VMs) is another avenue to teach
   complex concepts in computer science, engineering, and Information
   Technology (IT). Third, cloud computing is an inexpensive way for
   clients to access information from multiple locations and devices.
   Fourth, universities can use the Operating System (OS) Linux and its
   various distributions as replacements for commercial operating systems
   like Windows in order to reduce IT costs. Lastly, open source
   programming languages like Python and their associated Integrated

Abstract = {{This article presents an alternative architechture implementation with
   the purpose of provide real experiments of remote access and expand
   teaching practices focused on experimentation toward physics education.
   The research uses a low cost open hardware and an available
   multiplatform with open source applications. With this initiative, lab
   resources can be accessed from schools, as many of them have not
   appropriate science lab for practical activities. This reserch have been
   applied in two public schools from Ararangua/SC that also face
   difficulties when using the computer lab. As a solution, the students
   use their own mobile devices to do science and physics experiments
   accessing, controlling and observing real experiments installed in the
   Remote Experimentation Lab (RExLab). Making new experiments is a
   collaborative work with the teachers of these schools and with the lab
   staff to adapt their idea to a low cost system with the Raspberry Pi.
   The study presented here intends to facilitate the experiments
   adaptation and motivate other research labs to make their experiments
   available.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last twenty years, positioning with low cost Global Navigation
   Satellite System (GNSS) sensors have rapidly developed around the world
   at both a commercial and academic research level. For many years these
   instruments have only acquired the GPS constellation but are now able to
   track the Global'naja Navigacionnaja Sputnikovaja Sistema (GLONASS)
   constellation. This characteristic is very interesting, especially if
   used in hard-urban environments or in hard conditions where satellite
   visibility is low. The goal of this research is to investigate the
   contribution of the GLONASS constellation for mass-market receivers in
   order to analyse the performance in real time (Network Real Time
   Kinematic-NRTK positioning) with post-processing approaches. Under these
   conditions, it is possible to confirm that mass-market sensors could be
   a valid alternative to a more expensive receiver for a large number of
   surveying applications, but with low cost hardware the contribution of
   the GLONASS constellation for fixing ambiguities is useless, if not
   dangerous.}},

Title = {{An improved photometric stereo through distance estimation and light
   vector optimization from diffused maxima region}},
Journal = {{PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{15-22}},

Abstract = {{Although photometric stereo offers an attractive technique for acquiring
   3D data using low-cost equipment, inherent limitations in the
   methodology have served to limit its practical application, particularly
   in measurement or metrology tasks. Here we address this issue.
   Traditional photometric stereo assumes that lighting directions at every
   pixel are the same, which is not usually the case in real applications,
   and especially where the size of object being observed is comparable to
   the working distance. Such imperfections of the illumination may make
   the subsequent reconstruction procedures used to obtain the 3D shape of
   the scene prone to low frequency geometric distortion and systematic
   error (bias). Also, the 3D reconstruction of the object results in a
   geometric shape with an unknown scale. To overcome these problems a
   novel method of estimating the distance of the object from the camera is
   developed, which employs photometric stereo images without using other
   additional imaging modality. The method firstly identifies Lambertian
   diffused maxima region to calculate the object distance from the camera,
   from which the corrected per-pixel light vector is able to be derived
   and the absolute dimensions of the object can be subsequently estimated.
   We also propose a new calibration process to allow a dynamic(as an
   object moves in the field of view) calculation of light vectors for each
   pixel with little additional computation cost. Experiments performed on
   synthetic as well as real data demonstrates that the proposed approach
   offers improved performance, achieving a reduction in the estimated
   surface normal error of up to 45\% as well as mean height error of
   reconstructed surface of up to 6 mm. In addition, when compared to
   traditional photometric stereo, the proposed method reduces the mean
   angular and height error so that it is low, constant and independent of
   the position of the object placement within a normal working range. (C)

Abstract = {{Pulmonary rehabilitation is an essential component of chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) management with strong evidence
   supporting the efficacy of pulmonary rehabilitation to improve exercise
   capacity and quality of life, as well as reduce hospital admissions.
   However, it is estimated that only 2-5\% of people with COPD who could
   benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation have access to programs. Most
   research on the benefits of pulmonary rehabilitation has used equipment
   such as cycle ergometers and treadmills for endurance training and
   weight machines for resistance training. To enable greater availability
   of pulmonary rehabilitation, the efficacy of exercise training using
   minimal equipment needs to be evaluated. Randomised controlled trials
   that used minimal, low cost equipment for endurance (eight trials) and
   strength training (three trials) compared to no training in people with
   COPD were evaluated. Statistically and clinically significant
   differences in functional exercise capacity and quality of life, as well
   as improvements in strength were demonstrated when exercise training
   with minimal equipment was compared to no training {[}six-minute walk
   test: mean difference 40 (95\% CI: 13 to 67) metres; St George's
   Respiratory Questionnaire: mean difference -7 (95\% CI: -12 to -3)
   points]. While the number of studies is relatively small and of variable
   quality, there is growing evidence that exercise training using minimal,
   low cost equipment may be an alternative to equipment-intensive
   pulmonary rehabilitation programs.}},

   biomedical domain (e.g., gait analysis or orthopedic rehabilitation) and
   to a huge number of industrial sectors. In this quick evolving scenario
   it is hard to tell which technology is the most suitable for any desired
   goal. The aim of the paper is to answer to this issue by presenting a
   benchmark analysis that compares RGB and RGB-D technologies used to
   track performing people in a variety of conditions. In order to contrast
   the solutions, several different tasks have been selected,
   simultaneously captured and post-processed exactly in the same way. The
   test campaign has been designed to evaluate pros and cons according to
   the most important feature of a motion capture technology, such as
   volume of acquisition, accuracy of joint position and tracking of fast
   movements. Actors were asked to perform a number of tasks, among which
   free movements of arms, legs and full body, gait, and tasks performed
   interacting with a machine. The number of sensors around the scene and
   their disposition have been considered as well. We used Sony PS Eye
   cameras and Microsoft Kinect sensors as hardware solutions and iPisoft
   for data elaboration. The gathered results are organized, compared and
   discussed stressing performances and limitations of any combination and,
   at last, we proposed the best candidate technology for some key
   applications. (C) 2014 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers. Published

Abstract = {{A sensitive, simple and low-cost determination method for the total iron
   concentration in boiler water systems of power generation plants was
   developed by solid phase spectrometry (SPS) using
   2,4,6-tris(2-pyridyl)-1,3,5-triazine (TPTZ) as a coloring agent. The
   reagents and 0.08 cm(3) of a cation exchanger were added to a 50-cm(3)
   boiler water sample, then mixed for 30 min to adsorb/concentrate the
   produced Fe(TPTZ)2(2+) colored complex on the solid beads, resulting in
   a 625 times concentration of the target analyte without any other
   procedure. The detection limit of 0.1 mu g dm(-3) was obtained, and the
   optimum conditions for the digestion procedure and color developing
   reaction was investigated and reported. According to the application of
   this method to real samples, the present SPS method is the best one
   because of the shorter analysis time, simpler operation and use of very
   low-cost equipment compared to the conventional methods, such as TPTZ
   solution spectrophotometric method after a 16 times concentration,

Journal = {{EPE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Testing voltage source inverters (VSI) by using a set of real machines
   is often unsatisfactory. In fact, besides not being economical, this
   method only allows cursory inspection since the behaviour of an inverter
   under test (IUT) can then almost be assessed under few typical working
   conditions. In order to overcome these drawbacks, the present paper
   describes a low-cost hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) emulator for electric
   drives based on commercial IGBT voltage source inverters (VSI), the
   Virtual Machine (VM). Making use of several parallel-connected standard
   VSIs of the same type as the IUT, the VM is able to reproduce not only
   the steady state but also the dynamics of a real induction motor in a
   realistic way. This essential aspect is achieved by switching the IGBTs
   inside the inverters of the VM sequentially. Since the proposed HiL
   emulator is fully parameterizable, almost every induction machine within
   the power range of the IUT can be emulated. With the VM, extensive tests
   of power electronics devices can be carried out inexpensively and in
   short time intervals, a very convenient feature, especially for Small
   and Medium Enterprises (SMEs).}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring soil water content at high spatio-temporal resolution and
   coupled to other sensor data is crucial for applications oriented
   towards water sustainability in agriculture, such as precision
   irrigation or phenotyping root traits for drought tolerance. The cost of
   instrumentation, however, limits measurement frequency and number of
   sensors. The objective of this work was to design a low cost. open
   hardware. platform for multi-sensor measurements including water content
   at different depths, air and soil temperatures. The system is based on
   an open-source ARDUINO microcontroller-board, programmed in a simple
   integrated development environment (IDE). Low cost high-frequency
   dielectric probes were used in the platform and lab tested on three
   non-saline soils (ECe1: 2.5 < 0.1 mS/cm). Empirical calibration curves
   were subjected to cross-validation (leave-one-out method), and
   normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) were respectively 0.09 for the
   overall model, 0.09 for the sandy soil, 0.07 for the clay loam and 0.08
   for the sandy loam. The overall model (pooled soil data) fitted the data
   very well (R-2 = 0.89) showing a high stability, being able to generate
   very similar RMSEs during training and validation (RMSEtraining = 2.63;
   RMSEvalidation = 2.61). Data recorded on the card were automatically
   sent to a remote server allowing repeated field-data quality checks.
   This work provides a framework for the replication and upgrading of a
   customized low cost platform, consistent with the open source approach
   whereby sharing information on equipment design and software facilitates
   the adoption and continuous improvement of existing technologies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposed a novel methodology for the quantification of an
   artificial dye, sunset yellow (SY), in soft beverages, using image
   analysis (RGB histograms) and partial least squares regression. The
   developed method presented many advantages if compared with alternative
   methodologies, such as HPLC and UV/VIS spectrophotometry. It was faster,
   did not require sample pretreatment steps or any kind of solvents and
   reagents, and used a low cost equipment, a commercial flatbed scanner.
   This method was able to quantify SY in isotonic drinks and orange sodas,
   in the range of 7.8-39.7 mg L-1, with relative prediction errors lower
   than 10\%. A multivariate validation was also performed according to the
   Brazilian and international guidelines. Linearity, accuracy,
   sensitivity, bias, prediction uncertainty and a recently proposed tool,
   the beta-expectation tolerance intervals, were estimated. The
   application of digital images in food analysis is very promising,
   opening the possibility for automation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The rise of network speeds to tens of gigabits per second poses a
   challenge to develop packet processing applications that can cope with
   such bit rates. Therefore, the need for a suitable open source system
   that can be used as a prototype platform to test new network
   functionality while ensuring line-rate processing, accurate
   timestamping, and reduced power consumption has become evident. All
   these requirements cannot be achieved by using software-only solutions,
   but rather with hardware-based platforms such as NetFPGA. The main
   obstacle when using this type of open source FPGA-based solution is the
   cost of development, in both time and hardware development skills
   required. The spread of new circuit synthesis tools using high-level
   languages opens the door for the development of hardware-based
   networking applications with reasonable development effort, compared to
   the use of traditional hardware description languages. In this article,
   we describe how existing open source hardware-based platforms for
   networking applications will be fueled by the change in the programming
   model of FPGAs provided by modern high-level synthesis tools. For this,
   we implemented a network flow monitor using high-level languages and
   compared the effort spent with respect to a traditional hardware
   development cycle. Preliminary results are very promising, given that
   development time is reduced from months to weeks.}},

Abstract = {{For robots operating in outdoor environments, a number of factors,
   including weather, time of day, rough terrain, high speeds, and hardware
   limitations, make performing vision-based simultaneous localization and
   mapping with current techniques infeasible due to factors such as image
   blur and/or underexposure, especially on smaller platforms and low-cost
   hardware. In this paper, we present novel visual place-recognition and
   odometry techniques that address the challenges posed by low lighting,
   perceptual change, and low-cost cameras. Our primary contribution is a
   novel two-step algorithm that combines fast low-resolution whole image
   matching with a higher-resolution patch-verification step, as well as
   image saliency methods that simultaneously improve performance and
   decrease computing time. The algorithms are demonstrated using consumer
   cameras mounted on a small vehicle in a mixed urban and vegetated
   environment and a car traversing highway and suburban streets, at
   different times of day and night and in various weather conditions. The
   algorithms achieve reliable mapping over the course of a day, both when
   incrementally incorporating new visual scenes from different times of
   day into an existing map, and when using a static map comprising visual
   scenes captured at only one point in time. Using the two-step
   place-recognition process, we demonstrate for the first time
   single-image, error-free place recognition at recall rates above 50\%
   across a day-night dataset without prior training or utilization of
   image sequences. This place-recognition performance enables
   topologically correct mapping across day-night cycles. (C) 2014 Wiley

Abstract = {{The aim of designing and developing an open architecture mobile robot
   called RoMAA (in accordance with its name in Spanish) arises from the
   necessity to have a vehicle suitable for carrying out different
   experiments in the robotics research field. This vehicle has to have the

   field of mobile robotics and computer vision. The present paper
   describes in detail the development of the final version of the robot
   -RoMAA-II- as an improvement of the original version RoMAA. The
   different parts that compose the robot are described which include the
   electromechanical components, the onboard embedded system, along with
   the high level software running in the on-board computer; together with
   the description of its more relevant characteristics. Nowadays, four
   fully operational RoMAA-II robots are available in the CIII, which are
   regularly used for experiments of different research projects.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding basic concepts of electronics and computer programming
   allows researchers to get the most out of the equipment found in their
   laboratories. Although a number of platforms have been specifically
   designed for the general public and are supported by a vast array of
   on-line tutorials, this subject is not normally included in university
   chemistry curricula. Aiming to provide the basic concepts of hardware
   and software, this article is focused on the design and use of a simple
   module to control a series of PDMS-based valves. The module is based on
   a low-cost microprocessor (Teensy) and open-source software (Arduino).
   The microvalves were fabricated using thin sheets of PDMS and patterned
   using CO2 laser engraving, providing a simple and efficient way to
   fabricate devices without the traditional photolithographic process or
   facilities. Synchronization of valve control enabled the development of
   two simple devices to perform injection (1.6 +/- 0.4 mu L/stroke) and
   mixing of different solutions. Furthermore, a practical demonstration of
   the utility of this system for microscale chemical sample handling and
   analysis was achieved performing an on-chip acid-base titration,
   followed by conductivity detection with an open-source low-cost
   detection system. Overall, the system provided a very reproducible
   (98\%) platform to perform fluid delivery at the microfluidic scale.}},

Abstract = {{Diamond/Cu composites fabricated via the traditional powder metallurgy
   method show low thermal conductivities due to the poor wettability
   between diamond and Cu matrix. The fabrication method adopted in this
   study provides a simple and low-cost method for producing diamond/metal
   composites. Thermal properties of the diamond/Cu-Ti composites
   fabricated by pressureless sintering at 1373 K for 30 min with variation
   in diamond particle sizes and volume fractions were thoroughly
   investigated. The composites produced in this study exhibited thermal
   conductivity as high as 608 W/m K for 60 vol.\% bimodal diamond/Cu-2
   at.\% Ti composite comprised of 50 vol.\% diamond particles with the
   size of 300 mu m and 10 vol.\% diamond particles with the size of 150 mu
   m. A suitable coefficient of thermal expansion of 5.4 x 10(-6) 1/K was
   obtained. This thermal conductivity value comes up to 92\% of the
   thermal conductivity calculated by Hasselman and Johnson model combining
   with diffuse mismatch model. The predicted value from this model is in
   good agreement with the experimental value. Furthermore, the
   pressureless sintering is a simple technique that requires only low-cost
   equipment, making this cost-effective method attractive for metal matrix
   composite fabrication. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Background Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training at school is
   recommended. Limited school resources prevent implementation. The
   learning efficacy of low-cost training strategies is unknown.
   Objective To evaluate the efficacy of different CPR learning strategies
   using low-cost didactic tools.
   Methods Children (n = 593, 15-16 years) were randomized to four training
   conditions: (1) manikin + teacher instruction (control group), (2)
   manikin + video instruction, (3) foam dice + plastic bag + peer training
   + teacher instruction, and (4) foam dice + plastic bag + peer training +
   video instruction. After a 50 min training, a 3 min CPR test on a
   manikin was performed using SkillReporting Software (Laerdal, Norway),
   and repeated after 6 months. The data of children without previous CPR
   training were analysed. Analysis of variance and the chi(2)-test
   assessed differences between groups.
   Results Complete data sets were available for 165 pupils. Initially,
   group 3 scored lower on the mean ventilation volume (P < 0.05). The
   control group scored better than the alternative groups (P < 0.05) on
   the mean compression rate. After 6 months, the differences disappeared.
   All groups scored equally on ventilation volume (P = 0.12), compression
   depth (P = 0.11), compression rate (P = 0.10), correct hand position (P
   = 0.46) and number of correct compressions (P = 0.76). Ventilation
   volume was sufficient in 32\% of the pupils, 18\% had a correct
   compression depth and 59\% had a correct compression rate.
   Conclusion Training efficacy with low-cost equipment was not different
   from training with a manikin. The outcome for all training strategies
   was suboptimal. The basics of CPR can be taught with alternative
   equipment if manikins are not available. (C) 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health

Abstract = {{A continuous-time plant with a discretized continuous-time controller
   does not yield stability if the sampling rate is lower than some certain
   level. Thus far, high-performance electronic control has made use of
   expensive hardware needed to implement discretized continuous-time
   controllers; low-cost hardware generally does not have a sufficiently
   high sampling rate. This technical note presents results comparing
   performance indexes with and without intersample behavior, and provides
   some answers to the question of how a low-specification device can
   control a plant effectively. We consider a machine simulating wafer
   handling robots, which is an electromechanical system driven by a direct
   drive motor, at a semiconductor factory. We illustrate the controller
   design for the robot with and without intersample behavior, and present
   simulations and experimental results using these controllers. Taking
   intersample behavior into account proves to be effective in improving
   control performance and makes it possible to choose a relatively long
   sampling period. Controller design in terms of the performance index
   with intersample behavior makes it possible to deal with situations in
   which a sufficiently short sampling period may not be employed, and
   freedom of controller design may be widened, especially regarding the
   choice of the sampling period.}},

Abstract = {{In this modern world many communication devices are highly intelligent
   and interconnected between each other. Any up-gradation of the hardware
   in the existing communication devices is not easier one. Compatibility
   of the new hardware with existing hardware is highly essential. But the
   new protocols may or may not support the older one. The solution for
   these problems can be provided by using the reconfigurable hardware
   design. The hardware can be reprogrammed according to the new change in
   technology up-gradation. The cost of commercially available hardware and
   software requirements for setting up such a module is very high. This
   can be solved by using Open source hardware and software such as
   Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) and GNU Radio. This work
   demonstrates how the modern analog communication system like Community
   Radio Schemes and Radio Data System (RDS) and digital communication
   systems such as Simple Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) and OFDM based
   data communication can be developed using the Open source hardware
   USRP1. This work will be helpful even for first year level of
   engineering students to easily implement any communication and control
   applications with cheaper cost.}},

   prototyping}},
Journal = {{ROBOTICS AND AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},

Number = {{7, SI}},
Pages = {{1073-1084}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Rapid prototyping is a key aspect for the development of innovative
   robotic applications. A modular, platform-based, approach is the way to
   obtain this result. Modular approaches are common for software
   development, but hardware is still crafted often re-inventing solutions
   every time. As a consequence, the resources that should be invested in
   the development of a new robot get often drained by the implementation
   of a physical, working prototype to test the application idea. To
   overcome this problem, we propose R2P (Rapid Robot Prototyping), a
   framework to implement real-time, high-quality architectures for robotic
   systems with off-the-shelf basic modules (e.g., sensors, actuators, and
   controllers), integrating hardware and software, which can be assembled
   in a plug-and-play way. R2P provides hardware modules, a protocol for
   real-time communication, a middleware to connect components as well as
   tools to support the development of software on the modules. R2P aims at
   dramatically reduce time and efforts required to build a prototype
   robot, making it possible to focus the resources on the development of
   new robotic applications instead of struggling on their implementation.
   This enables also people with experience in a specific application
   domain, but with little technical background, to actively participate in
   the development of new robotic applications. R2P is open-source both in
   its software and hardware to promote its diffusion among the robotics
   community and novel business models that will substantially reduce the
   costs to design a new robotic product. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Color measurements have traditionally been linked to expensive and
   difficult to handle equipment. The set of mathematical transformations
   that are needed to transfer a color that we observe in any object that
   doesn't emit its own light (which is usually called a color-object) so
   that it can be displayed on a computer screen or printed on paper is not
   at all trivial. This usually requires a thorough knowledge of color
   spaces, colorimetric transformations and color management systems. The
   TCS3414CS color sensor (I2C Sensor Color Grove), a system for capturing,
   processing and color management that allows the colors of any
   non-self-luminous object using a low-cost hardware based on Arduino, is
   presented in this paper. Specific software has been developed in Matlab
   and a study of the linearity of chromatic channels and accuracy of color
   measurements for this device has been undertaken. All used scripts
   (Arduino and Matlab) are attached as supplementary material. The results
   show acceptable accuracy values that, although obviously do not reach
   the levels obtained with the other scientific instruments, for the price
   difference they present a good low cost option.}},

Title = {{The application of precisely controlled functional electrical
   stimulation to the shoulder, elbow and wrist for upper limb stroke
   rehabilitation: a feasibility study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{JUN 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Functional electrical stimulation (FES) during repetitive
   practice of everyday tasks can facilitate recovery of upper limb
   function following stroke. Reduction in impairment is strongly
   associated with how closely FES assists performance, with advanced
   iterative learning control (ILC) technology providing precise upper-limb
   assistance. The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of
   extending ILC technology to control FES of three muscle groups in the
   upper limb to facilitate functional motor recovery post-stroke.
   Methods: Five stroke participants with established hemiplegia undertook
   eighteen intervention sessions, each of one hour duration. During each
   session FES was applied to the anterior deltoid, triceps, and
   wrist/finger extensors to assist performance of functional tasks with
   real-objects, including closing a drawer and pressing a light switch.
   Advanced model-based ILC controllers used kinematic data from previous
   attempts at each task to update the FES applied to each muscle on the
   subsequent trial. This produced stimulation profiles that facilitated
   accurate completion of each task while encouraging voluntary effort by
   the participant. Kinematic data were collected using a Microsoft Kinect,
   and mechanical arm support was provided by a SaeboMAS. Participants
   completed Fugl-Meyer and Action Research Arm Test clinical assessments
   pre- and post-intervention, as well as FES-unassisted tasks during each
   intervention session.
   Results: Fugl-Meyer and Action Research Arm Test scores both
   significantly improved from pre-to post-intervention by 4.4 points.
   Improvements were also found in FES-unassisted performance, and the
   amount of arm support required to successfully perform the tasks was
   reduced.
   Conclusions: This feasibility study indicates that technology comprising
   low-cost hardware fused with advanced FES controllers accurately assists
   upper limb movement and may reduce upper limb impairments following
   stroke.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{853-864}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Coarse clastic sediments (boulders) on coastlines have seen a
   groundswell in geomorphic research interest over recent years,
   associated in part with the potential of boulder evidence for
   interpreting characteristics of high-energy wave processes. Yet, the
   fundamental property of boulder volume is normally difficult to measure
   accurately owing to complex clast morphology and irregular surface
   texture. To tackle this problem, this paper concentrates on creating
   precise, measurable and textured three-dimensional (3D) models of
   coastal boulders without physical contact with the object, based on
   multi-view image measurement techniques. This method has several
   advantages over traditional measurements that are inaccurate or
   alternative solutions using costly techniques such as terrestrial laser
   scanning. Our methods propose the use of low-cost equipment (digital
   cameras) that can be used in various coastal environments to easily
   acquire numerous images of the object of interest. Initial results can
   be rapidly assessed in the field for immediate quality control.
   Resulting 3D models, built from overlapping multi-view digital
   photographs, allow the reconstruction of realistic-looking and textured
   boulder surfaces. A particular interest in this task is the family of
   algorithms known as structure from motion (SFM). The work presents
   analysis of SFM techniques by examining 3D models of boulders observed
   at a coastal field site on Lu Dao Island in south-eastern Taiwan.

Abstract = {{We discuss the evolution and state-of-the-art of the use of Unmanned
   Aerial Systems (UAS) in the field of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing
   (PaRS). UAS, Remotely-Piloted Aerial Systems, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
   or simply, drones are a hot topic comprising a diverse array of aspects
   including technology, privacy rights, safety and regulations, and even
   war and peace. Modern photogrammetry and remote sensing identified the
   potential of UAS-sourced imagery more than thirty years ago. In the last
   five years, these two sister disciplines have developed technology and
   methods that challenge the current aeronautical regulatory framework and
   their own traditional acquisition and processing methods. Navety and
   ingenuity have combined off-the-shelf, low-cost equipment with
   sophisticated computer vision, robotics and geomatic engineering. The
   results are cm-level resolution and accuracy products that can be
   generated even with cameras costing a few-hundred euros. In this review
   article, following a brief historic background and regulatory status

Abstract = {{The study of biosignals has had a transforming role in multiple aspects
   of our society, which go well beyond the health sciences domains to
   which they were traditionally associated with. While biomedical
   engineering is a classical discipline where the topic is amply covered,
   today biosignals are a matter of interest for students, researchers and
   hobbyists in areas including computer science, informatics, electrical
   engineering, among others. Regardless of the context, the use of
   biosignals in experimental activities and practical projects is heavily
   bounded by the cost, and limited access to adequate support materials.
   In this paper we present an accessible, albeit versatile toolkit,
   composed of low-cost hardware and software, which was created to
   reinforce the engagement of different people in the field of biosignals.
   The hardware consists of a modular wireless biosignal acquisition system
   that can be used to support classroom activities, interface with other
   devices, or perform rapid prototyping of end-user applications. The
   software comprehends a set of programming APIs, a biosignal processing
   toolbox, and a framework for real time data acquisition and
   postprocessing. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Cost-effectiveness of interventions for increasing the possession of
   functioning smoke alarms in households with pre-school children: a
   modelling study}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{MAY 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: The UK has one of the highest rates for deaths from fire and
   flames in children aged 0-14 years compared to other high income
   countries. Evidence shows that smoke alarms can reduce the risk of
   fire-related injury but little exists on their cost-effectiveness. We
   aimed to compare the cost effectiveness of different interventions for
   the uptake of `functioning' smoke alarms and consequently for the
   prevention of fire-related injuries in children in the UK.
   Methods: We carried out a decision model-based probabilistic
   cost-effectiveness analysis. We used a hypothetical population of
   newborns and evaluated the impact of living in a household with or
   without a functioning smoke alarm during the first 5 years of their life
   on overall lifetime costs and quality of life from a public health
   perspective. We compared seven interventions, ranging from usual care to
   more complex interventions comprising of education, free/low cost
   equipment giveaway, equipment fitting and/or home safety inspection.
   Results: Education and free/low cost equipment was the most
   cost-effective intervention with an estimated incremental
   cost-effectiveness ratio of 34,200 pound per QALY gained compared to
   usual care. This was reduced to approximately 4,500 pound per QALY
   gained when 1.8 children under the age of 5 were assumed per household.
   Conclusions: Assessing cost-effectiveness, as well as effectiveness, is
   important in a public sector system operating under a fixed budget
   restraint. As highlighted in this study, the more effective
   interventions (in this case the more complex interventions) may not
   necessarily be the ones considered the most cost-effective.}},

Abstract = {{Clouds play an important role in climate change, in the prediction of
   local weather and also on aviation safety when instrument assisted
   flying is not available. In the case of aviation safety, the most
   important parameters are the cloud base height and the amount of cloud
   cover. Cloud base height can be measured by a ceilometer which, due to
   its relatively high cost, is not available at many small aerodromes.
   Recently, a low cost solution, based in digital photography and
   stereovision has been proposed. This paper describes the developed
   prototype along with its measuring principle and the recent advances
   which include more robust but low cost hardware, an automated
   calibration procedure based on photos of stars that exhibit no parallax
   and an automated procedure to find the cameras orientation relative to
   geographic north. Measurements of the cloud base height by the proposed
   system are compared with measurements obtained by a LIDAR for
   validation. The wind speed and direction relative to geographic north
   are also measured and compared with results from a weather model.
   Finally, an uncertainty analysis of the measurement system is presented.

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{DRAM technology challenges have increased the necessity to adapt to the
   emerging memory technologies like Phase-Change Memory (PCM or PRAM).
   While such emerging technologies provide benefits like storage density,
   nonvolatility, and low energy consumption, they are constrained by
   limited write endurance that becomes more pronounced with process
   variation. In this article, we explore a novel PRAM-based main memory
   system which resuscitates a group of faulty pages in a cost-effective
   manner to significantly extend the PCM main memory lifetime while
   minimizing the performance impact. In particular, we explore three
   different dimensions of dynamic redundancy levels and group sizes, and
   design low-cost hardware and software support for our proposed schemes.
   We aim to have minimal hardware modifications (that have less than 1\%
   on-chip and off-chip area overheads). Also, our schemes can improve the
   PRAM lifetime by up to 105x (times) over a chip with no error correction
   capabilities, and outperform prior schemes such as DRM and ECP at a
   small fraction of the hardware cost. The performance overhead resulting
   from our scheme is less than 8\% on average across 21 applications from
   SPEC2006, Splash-2, and PARSEC benchmark suites.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{227}},
Pages = {{90-99}},
Month = {{APR 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Many neuroscience experiments rely on presenting stimuli and
   measuring participants' responses to these events. Often computer
   screens, speakers and keyboards are sufficient. However, these devices
   are not appropriate for some situations. For example, some studies
   present tactile or olfactory stimuli or brain stimulation. Likewise,
   keyboard buttons are not appropriate for use with vocal responses, small
   animals or individuals with motor impairments.
   New method: We describe StimSync, which simulates USB keyboard inputs,
   allowing use with most experimental software. StimSync can measure
   button presses, optical signals from magnetic resonance imaging systems,
   changes in ambient light (e.g. synchronizing intracranial
   electrography), and auditory events (a voice key). In addition to the
   USB keyboard mode (necessarily millisecond precision), StimSync can also
   be set to provide higher precision timing. This feature can be used to
   validate timing, ensuring event synchronization (e.g. auditory events,
   visual events, brain stimulation). In addition to recording inputs,
   StimSync provides seven digital outputs for controlling external
   devices. Finally, StimSync can record analog inputs; we illustrate how
   this can be used to evaluate the rise time for computer displays.
   Results: We observed outputs with a mean latency of 2.1 ms (sd = 0.17
   ms) and USB inputs with a mean latency of 2 ms (sd = 0.54 ms).
   Comparison with existing method(s): StimSync statistically outperforms
   two professional solutions and numerically outperforms other devices
   described in the literature.
   Conclusions: StimSync
   (http://www.mccauslandcenter.sc.edu/CRNL/tools/stimsync) provides an
   open-source solution for controlling and validating neuroscience
   experiments. In addition to sharing the design, we have produced a batch
   of devices to demonstrate the market for professional implementations.

Abstract = {{In the last years close-range photogrammetric scanning systems, are
   acquiring a larger market share. This is due to low-cost hardware,
   components and to new user-friendly software. The ultimate,
   photogrammetric 3D scanning systems are very accurate and precise
   because, of the high-resolution cameras (over 10 Mpixels) they are
   equipped of and, the more precise algorithms of their software. The
   calibration phase is the primary step for the development of a, precise
   photogrammetric scanner. Through a good calibration it is indeed,
   possible to eliminate optical aberration issues and to obtain precise
   and, accurate three-dimensional measurements. In this study a powerful,
   calibration method, named full-field calibration, was implemented to,
   obtain high-precision values, using an original three-dimensional,
   calibrator, developed so as to increase the performance of this type of,
   calibration. Prior to using any measurement or 3D scanning system,
   precision and, accuracy have to be assessed. In this study a robust
   validation method, for photogrammetric scanning systems has been
   proposed. The validation, procedure consisted in: (1) operator error
   analysis, (2) reproducibility, error-analysis, (3) control-system error
   analysis, (4) scanning system, error analysis., The measurements taken
   using the ``control system{''} (certified equipment in, terms of
   precision and accuracy) were considered as ``gold standard{''}. The,
   photogrammetric measurements, subsequently obtained by the scanning,
   system, were aligned to the ``gold standard{''} using Procrustes,
   registration. The system error was expressed as the displacement
   between, these two sets of measurements. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Turbidity is an internationally recognized criterion for assessing
   drinking water quality, because the colloidal particles in turbid water
   may harbor pathogens, chemically reduce oxidizing disinfectants, and
   hinder attempts to disinfect water with ultraviolet radiation. A
   turbidimeter is an electronic/optical instrument that assesses turbidity
   by measuring the scattering of light passing through a water sample
   containing such colloidal particles. Commercial turbidimeters cost
   hundreds or thousands of dollars, putting them beyond the reach of
   low-resource communities around the world. An affordable open-source
   turbidimeter based on a single light-to-frequency sensor was designed
   and constructed, and evaluated against a portable commercial
   turbidimeter. The final product, which builds on extensive published
   research, is intended to catalyze further developments in affordable
   water and sanitation monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Because of superficial location and not being covered by boney
   structure, thyroid is the ideal organ for 2-dimensional gray scale
   ultrasonography. Availability of relatively low cost equipment and ever
   increasing number of endocrinologists with expertise in thyroid
   ultrasound has made it an integral part of thyroid practice in the
   office of endocrinologists. In particular, the current recommendation
   for fine needle biopsy of thyroid nodules is ultrasound guided biopsy.
   Follow up of thyroid nodules for change in size can also be better
   documented by ultrasound than palpation. Although cytology obtained by
   fine needle biopsy is the gold standard for detection of malignancy, yet
   ultrasound features of the nodules direct the clinician to select for
   biopsy the higher risk nodules in a multinodular gland. For detection of
   parathyroid adenoma isotopic parathyroid scan is preferable but
   ultrasound is occasionally is needed for confirmation, in particular for
   cases when parathyroid isotopic scan is ambiguous. The present article
   is an overview of ultrasonography of thyroid and parathyroid intended
   for endocrinologists.}},

Abstract = {{The choice of the parameters has strong influence on the quality of the
   results obtained by the application of algorithms. Most researchers tend
   to select the values of their parameters in long and tedious trial and
   error approaches. Although, some methods have been developed for
   automatic parameter selection, they have not been widely used in the
   computer vision area. This paper presents the design of a general
   purpose framework for automatic parameter selection through a case
   study: a human limb tracking algorithm developed for applications that
   will be used in rehabilitation scenarios with low cost equipment. The
   tracking algorithm first detects the limb by using a skin segmentation
   approach, then the position of an idealized limb model is updated using
   Simulated Annealing. The framework for automatic parameter selection
   treats each parameter from the tracking algorithm according to its
   domain and uses a modified version of Harmony Search Optimization
   algorithm that includes a dominance criterion. The obtained results are
   presented as well and show that selected parameters behave well for the
   case of study.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the implementation of the coarse-grained
   reconfigurable architecture (CGRA) DART with on-line error detection
   intended for increasing fault-tolerance. Most parts of the data paths

   3, whereas only the logic unit is protected using duplication with
   comparison. These low-cost hardware techniques would allow to tolerate
   temporary faults (including so called soft errors caused by radiation),
   provided that some technique based on re-execution of the last operation
   is used. Synthesis results obtained for a 90 nm CMOS technology have
   confirmed significant hardware and power consumption savings of the
   proposed approach over commonly used duplication with comparison.
   Introducing one extra pipeline stage in the self-checking version of the

Abstract = {{The ever-intensifying time-to-market pressure imposes great challenges
   on the pre-silicon design phase of hardware. Before the tape-out, a
   pre-silicon design has to be thoroughly inspected by time-consuming
   functional verification and code review to exclude bugs. For functional
   verification and code review, a critical issue determining their
   efficiency is the allocation of resources (e.g., computational resources
   and manpower) to different modules of a design, which is conventionally
   guided by designers' experiences. Such practices, though simple and
   straightforward, may take high risks of wasting resources on bug-free
   modules or missing bugs in buggy modules, and thus could affect the
   success and timeline of the tape-out. In this paper, we propose a novel
   framework called pre-silicon bug forecast to predict the bug information
   of hardware designs. In this framework, bug models are built via machine
   learning techniques to characterize the relationship between design
   characteristics and the bug information, which can be leveraged to
   predict how bugs distribute in different modules of the current design.
   Such predicted bug information is adequate to regulate the resources
   among different modules to achieve efficient functional verification and
   code review. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed pre-silicon
   bug forecast framework, we conducted detailed experiments on several
   open-source hardware projects. Moreover, we also investigate the impacts
   of different learning techniques and different sets of characteristic on
   the performance of bug models. Experimental results show that with
   appropriate learning techniques and characteristics, about 90\% modules
   could be correctly predicted as buggy or clean and the number of bugs of
   each module could also be accurately predicted.}},

Abstract = {{The capability to fabricate photovoltaic (PV) solar cells on a large
   scale and at a competitive price is a milestone waiting to be achieved.
   Currently, such a fabrication method is lacking because the effective
   methods are either difficult to scale up or expensive due to the
   necessity for fabrication in a vacuum environment. Nevertheless, for a
   class of thin film solar cells, in which the solar cell materials can be
   processed in a solution, up scalable and vacuum-free fabrication
   techniques can be envisioned. In this context, all or some layers of
   polymer, dye-sensitized, quantum dot, and copper indium gallium selenide
   thin film solar cells illustrate some examples that may be processed in
   solution. The solution-processed materials may be transferred to the
   substrate by atomizing the solution and carrying the spray droplets to
   the substrate, a process that will form a thin film after evaporation of
   the solvent. Spray coating is performed at atmospheric pressure using
   low cost equipment with a roll-to-roll process capability, making it an
   attractive fabrication technique, provided that fairly uniform layers
   with high charge carrier separation and transport capability can be
   made. In this paper, the feasibility, the recent advances and challenges
   of fabricating spray-on thin film solar cells, the dynamics of spray and
   droplet impaction on the substrate, the photo-induced electron transfer
   in spray-on solar cells, the challenges on characterization and
   simulation, and the commercialization status of spray-on solar cells are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Direct-conversion radio receivers can offer highly integrated low-cost
   hardware solutions for cognitive radio (CR) devices. Such receivers are,
   however, also very sensitive to various radio frequency (RF) impairments
   such as IQ imbalance, which can considerably limit the spectrum sensing
   capabilities. Most of the existing spectrum sensing studies in
   literature assume an ideal RF receiver and hence neglect the impacts of
   such practical RF hardware limitations. In this article, we study energy
   detection (ED) based spectrum sensing in both single-channel and
   multi-channel direct-conversion receiver scenarios impaired by IQ
   imbalance. With complex Gaussian primary user (PU) signal models, we
   first derive the detection and false alarm probabilities in closed-form
   for both receiver scenarios. The analytical results, confirmed through
   extensive simulations, show that while the single-channel receiver
   scenario is fairly robust to IQ imbalance, the wideband multi-channel
   sensing receiver is very sensitive to the image channel crosstalk
   induced by IQ imbalance. More specifically, it is shown that the false
   alarm probability of multi-channel energy detection increases
   significantly, compared to ideal RF receiver case, and the exact
   performance depends on the image channel power level and IQ imbalance
   values. In order to prevent such degradation in the ability to identify
   free spectrum, a waveform level interference cancellation method is then
   proposed to mitigate the image channel crosstalk. The optimum
   cancellation coefficient yielding interference-free signal is first
   derived, being also complemented with a practical coefficient sample
   estimator. An explicit condition is also derived for which the proposed
   cancellation scheme deploying the practical coefficient sample estimator
   provides performance gain in the sensing decisions compared to
   uncompensated energy detection. Extensive computer simulations with
   various signal and imbalance conditions are provided which demonstrate
   that the proposed enhanced energy detection can suppress the image
   channel crosstalk efficiently, yielding detection and false alarm
   probabilities essentially identical to those of an ideal RF receiver.}},

Abstract = {{A mobile and modular educational robotic platform called ``Yrobot{''} is
   presented for the purpose of increasing students interest in studying
   technical suNects, to support teaching and to promote the selected areas
   of the information and communication technologies. The developed mobile
   robotic system is open hardware. Its base part - a mobile robotic
   platform - is being continuously extended by expansion modules to enable
   the development and implementation of the specific applications. As the
   first expansion module for the ``Yrobot{''}, an audio-communication
   subsystem module based on Texas Instruments solutions has been
   developed. This extension module is called ``AudioCom{''} and allows the
   development and verification of the simple modulation techniques
   operation. These techniques are commonly used in the radio frequency
   communication as well. This paper describes the motivation for the
   development of the mentioned platform, the expansion module circuit
   design, software solution and the experimental testing results.}},

Abstract = {{One serious challenge of wireless multi-hop ad hoc networks is frequent
   link and node failures due to lossy wireless channels and low-cost
   hardware. Failure detection plays an important role in network
   maintenance. In order to reduce communication overhead, local-based
   failure detection methods conduct diagnosis processes in a local area.
   However, the overhead of them is still very large because several
   redundant detection processes are triggered for one failure by several
   nodes. In this paper, we present a new failure detection approach named
   Root Node Reduction (RNR), which can reduce the number of detection
   processes by a backoff scheme. Furthermore, we propose two additional
   strategies to improve diagnosis accuracy, including multi fusion which
   guarantees complete evidence collection, and multi report which improves
   the reception ratio of diagnosis conclusion report. The comparison
   results show that the performance of communication overhead, diagnosis
   accuracy and data packet reception is improved by these schemes.}},

   will bring to light the set up components and deployment of a mobile

Abstract = {{Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are at the core of the future industrial
   control systems. Most industrial CPSs are usually implemented over
   expensive and domain-specific hardware platforms, such as industrial
   embedded control systems, mainly for safety and security reasons. In
   less-critical applications the use of open, low-cost hardware platforms
   that provide adequate computing capabilities, such as microcontroller
   test boards, may provide an interesting alternative to reduce costs and
   reduce prototyping time. However, for most automation engineers working
   with this kind of platforms may become a daunting task because of the
   new concepts to be learnt. So, in the authors' view, it could be very
   valuable easing the application of current industrial standards on top
   of such low-cost platforms. In particular, the IEC 61499 standard
   provides a higher level of design, which allows combining software
   components in a flexible way, with independence of the underlying
   hardware. This work addresses the design of applications by means of the
   IEC 61499 standard on top of Raspberry Pi boards.}},

Abstract = {{Machine-to-Machine technology supports several application scenarios,
   such as smart metering, automotive, health-care and city monitoring.
   Smart metering applications have attracted the interest of companies and
   governments since these applications bring many benefits (e.g. costs
   reduction and increased reliability) for production, monitoring and
   distribution of utilities, such as gas, water and electricity. Multi-hop
   wireless communication is a cost-effective technology for smart metering
   applications because it extends the wireless range and enables fast
   deployment. Smart metering data communicated via wireless multi-hop
   approaches needs mechanisms that makes the communication less vulnerable
   to security threats and saves the device resources. Data encryption and
   data aggregation mechanisms emerge as potential solutions to fulfill
   these requirements. However, the simultaneous execution of data
   encryption and data aggregation mechanisms is not a trivial task. This
   is because the data encryption prevents the data aggregation mechanism
   to summarize the data along the path. Another challenge is to manage
   both mechanisms according to the concurrent Machine-to-Machine (M2M)
   applications interests. In this context, we present sMeter, which is a
   framework that deals with multiple applications interests, avoiding
   interest conflicts of concurrent users and supporting the management of
   data aggregation and data encryption. sMeter is implemented using
   low-cost hardware in an indoor environment. The communication is
   performed via a wireless multi-hop technology, and the performance of
   this communication is evaluated in terms of delay, data reception ratio
   and received signal strength indication.}},

   and modelled using engine simulation. This project was based on two
   concepts. The first was to open the intake valve during the exhaust
   stroke, thus expelling burnt gases from the cylinder into the intake
   manifold and then later re-admitting these gases into the cylinder
   during the intake stroke of the next cycle. The second was to open the
   exhaust valve during the intake stroke, allowing burnt gases from the
   exhaust manifold to enter the cylinder at the same time as the fresh
   charge enters. Both technologies studied were able to recirculate the
   exhaust gases without an external EGR system. The EGR amount was
   controlled by either an intake throttle or an exhaust throttle. The
   amount of EGR was predicted using engine simulation. The brake-specific
   fuel consumption (BSFC) and brake-specific NOx(BSNOx) trade off was the
   main criterion used to select the best technology, although other
   features such as predicted manifold pressures and engine-out soot were
   also considered.
   The results indicate that, by using increased amounts of EGR while
   varying the intake or exhaust throttle position, NO emissions can be
   reduced with a slight BSFC penalty. These methods are thus a low cost
   means of reducing engine-out NO emissions.}},

Abstract = {{Cooperative sensor self-localization (CSL) in wireless networks usually
   requires the nodes to be equipped with specific ranging hardware
   including ultra-wideband or ultrasonic distance sensors. Such designs
   are not suitable for application in low-cost, low-power sensor networks.
   Here, we demonstrate how low-cost, low-power, asynchronous sensor nodes
   can be used to perform CSL (and, simultaneously, distributed
   synchronization) by means of time-stamped communication without
   additional ranging hardware. Our method combines a belief propagation
   message passing algorithm for cooperative simultaneous localization and
   synchronization (CoSLAS) with a MAC-layer time stamping scheme. We
   validate the models underlying the CoSLAS algorithm by means of
   measurements, and we demonstrate that the localization accuracy achieved
   by our hardware implementation is far better than that corresponding to
   the time resolution and measurement errors of the hardware.}},

Abstract = {{Although the Arduino is currently the most popular low-cost hardware
   platform within the Do-it-Yourself (DiY) community, it is not designed
   taking into account the specific requirements of physiological
   computing. As a result of previous work by our group, a novel hardware
   framework for physiological computing, entitled BITalino, was proposed,
   to allow anyone to create their own projects and applications with
   biosignal sensors. In this work, we benchmark the Arduino and BITalino
   platforms, targeting the evaluation of their performance for the purpose
   of biosignals acquisition. We also describe a few physiological
   computing applications built with the BITalino, that show the potential
   of this platform within the engineering community. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Today, the environmental monitoring and quality have a growing interest.
   This promotes the development of new monitoring tools, and especially
   those with outstanding reliability and response time, and nonstationary
   features. This paper presents the design and implementation of a
   transportable gas detection and environmental monitoring device. Ideas
   taken from the Arduino and Lego constructions are kept in mind during
   the design of the device, looking further facilitate the development of
   product family of this device; likewise, the use of reconfigurable and
   interconnectable platforms with open hardware are considered. The
   transducers have been selected based on their reliability, small size
   and easy inclusion in an electronic system. Then, was developed a device
   that supports transducers for environmental gases, such as: carbon
   monoxide (CO), ozone (O-3), volatile organic compounds (VOC), nitrogen
   dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2); as well as the possibility to
   interface with other systems for common gases such as carbon dioxide
   (CO2) and oxygen (O-2) before developed. Other environmental measures
   such as speed and wind direction, temperature and relative humidity, may
   also be included. In this case, a configurable platform based on
   mixed-signal circuits, PSoC5, was used for the development of embedded
   system. This platform can be interfaced with different Arduino shields
   and achieves the integration of several analog functions. This system
   manages, acquires and processes signals from the above transducers. The
   measurements can be displayed on an LCD display, save into an SD memory
   and send to the Web using Ethernet interface. The device is hand size,
   easy to carry and can operate with a battery. Its user interface is
   simple and provides updated and in-situ readings. Currently, successful
   results have been obtained from the functional and metrology testing of
   the manufactured prototype.}},

Abstract = {{The diagnosis of electrical motors through the detection of fault
   frequency signatures in the current's spectrum has become an established
   standard in the field of industrial maintenance systems. Nevertheles,
   its implementation on devices with low computing power remains a
   practical challenge. Industrial controllers, such as programmable logic
   controllers, or modern, low cost controller hardware, such as the
   Arduino or the Raspberry Pi open source hardware proposals, lack both
   the on-board memory and the high speed data acquisition hardware to
   perform an accurate spectral analysis of the machine's current, in order
   to identify the spectral components produced by each type of fault. In
   this paper, a signal conditioning unit, based on a novel downsampling
   method of the current, is presented. This unit reduces the amount of
   current samples that must be processed by the diagnostic unit to a mere
   sample per current cycle, maintains the sub-hertz accuracy needed to
   resolve fault, and converts the mains component into a constant value
   that can be easily eliminated without using any additional filter.
   Besides, it is implemented using low cost devices, just resistors and
   operational amplifiers. The proposed method is theoretically developed
   in this paper, and it has been validated using induction motors with
   broken bars fed directly by the mains or through variable speed drives.}},

Abstract = {{A key issue in VoIP services market is the availability of tools that
   permit a constant monitoring of the relevant Quality of Service (QoS)
   parameters. Several commercial and open-source solutions are available,
   based on dedicated hardware and/or open-source software. These solutions
   aim to achieve a tradeoff between performance and instrumentation cost.
   In general, high performance and precise monitoring tools are based on
   dedicated hardware, which is expensive. In contrast, cheaper
   software-based solutions working on top of a Commercially available
   Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware are performance-limited, especially when
   serving high-capacity links. In this context, the paper presents an
   open-source solution for QoS monitoring of VoIP traffic that achieves
   high performance at significantly lower costs. The proposed solution
   exploits the performance capabilities achievable with a
   field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The associated costs reduction
   arises from the high flexibility of an FPGA. Our experimental analysis
   explores the accuracy of the developed prototype, measuring against
   relevant QoS parameters of VoIP traffic on high capacity links.}},

   Humanitarian Initiatives Committee (HIC) of IEEE Region 7 organized a
   student design competition {[}1] with the specific objective of
   understanding the design process of HT ``Solutions{''} to be made
   available as open source. The 2011 competition was an initial effort to
   understand open source licensing, open source hardware and the open
   source development model. Adoption of the open source development model
   was a stated objective of IEEE's Humanitarian technology Challenge (HTC)
   {[}2]. The HIC held a student paper competition in 2013. The goal of the
   2013 competition was to nurture the growing interest in Humanitarian
   Technology in Region 7; to address HIC's concerns from the 2011
   competition, more effort was focused in the paper review process for the
   2013 competition and standard IEEE peer-review tools and processes were
   used. This document presents in Section III the lessons learned during
   these two competitions, and proposes in section IV a Product Lifecycle
   Management framework for the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) of OSI
   development that leverages IEEE's peer-review process.}},

Abstract = {{Color science is perhaps the most universally tangible discipline within
   the optical sciences for people of all ages. Excepting a small and
   relatively well-understood minority, we can see that the world around us
   consists of a multitude of colors; yet, describing the ``what{''},
   ``why{''}, and ``how{''} of these colors is not an easy task, especially
   without some sort of equally colorful visual aids. While static displays
   (e.g., poster boards, etc.) serve their purpose, there is a growing
   trend, aided by the recent permeation of small interactive devices into
   our society, for interactive and immersive learning. However, for the
   uninitiated, designing software and hardware for this purpose may not be
   within the purview of all optical scientists and engineers.
   Enter open source. Open source ``anything{''} are those tools and
   designs -- hardware or software -- that are available and free to use,
   often without any restrictive licensing. Open source software may be
   familiar to some, but the open source hardware movement is relatively
   new. These are electronic circuit board designs that are provided for
   free and can be implemented in physical hardware by anyone. This
   movement has led to the availability of some relatively inexpensive, but
   quite capable, computing power for the creation of small devices.
   This paper will showcase the design and implementation of the software
   and hardware that was used to create an interactive demonstration kit
   for color. Its purpose is to introduce and demonstrate the concepts of
   color spectra, additive color, color rendering, and metamers.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a simple Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)-based air
   quality monitoring system (WSN-AQMS) for industrial and urban areas. The
   proposed framework comprises a set of gas sensors (ozone, CO, and NO2)
   that are deployed on stacks and infrastructure of a Zigbee WSN and a
   central server to support both short-term real-time incident management
   and a long-term strategic planning. This architecture would use
   open-hardware open-software gas sensing capable motes {[}6] made by
   Libelium. These motes use the ZigBee communication protocol and provide
   a real-time low cost monitoring system through the use of low cost, low
   data rate, and low power wireless communication technology. The proposed
   monitoring system can be transferred to or shared by other applications.
   We also introduce a simple but efficient clustering protocol dubbed
   hereafter ``Clustering Protocol for Air Sensor network{''} (CPAS) for
   the proposed WSN-AQMS framework. CPAS proves to be efficient in terms of
   network energy consumption, network lifetime, and the rate at which data

Abstract = {{This chapter illustrates how to set up an inexpensive but effective
   Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) platform for the test of wind turbine (WT)
   controllers. The dynamics of the WT are simulated on the open-source
   National Renewable Energy Laboratory WT simulator called FAST (Fatigue,
   Aerodynamics, Structures, and Turbulence), which emulates all required
   input signals of the controller and reacts to the controller commands
   (almost) like an onshore real turbine of 5 MW. The dynamic torque
   control system runs on an open hardware Arduino microcontroller board,
   which is connected to the virtual WT via USB. In particular, the power
   generation control in the full load region for variable-speed
   variable-pitch wind turbines is considered through torque and pitch
   control. The HIL proposed platform is used to characterize the behavior
   of the WT in normal operation as well as in fault operation. In
   particular, a stuck/unstuck fault is modeled and the behavior of a
   proposed chattering torque controller is analyzed in comparison to a
   baseline torque controller.}},

Abstract = {{Ring-rolling is an industrial forming process to produce high-strength
   metal rings up to 6m diameter. Thick-walled cylindrical workpieces of
   material, typically metallic alloys, are compressed between two or more
   internal and external rollers and rotated until a target geometry, often
   outer diameter, is achieved. The process is inherently unstable and the
   process is often constrained and/or controlled to improve its stability.
   This paper presents an image processing algorithm for the measurement of
   ring geometry through photogrammetry in real-time. These measurements
   will form part of the feedback control system for a ring-rolling
   process. An off-the-shelf USB webcam is used to capture images of the
   ring during forming and the scene is controlled to maximise contrast and
   minimise occlusions of the ring. The image processing tasks include
   object identification, edge detection, outlier rejection and distortion
   rectification. The process has been implemented on a desktop-scale
   forming machine and has been shown to work at rates suitable for control
   the ring-rolling process using feedback.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this work is to develop a low cost hardware-based
   demonstrator for system identification ( SI) methods that can be used in
   a self-paced training kit by students as well as practicing engineers.
   The focus lies on hands-on training with a high return on effort. The
   training starts from experiments that are performed on the demonstrator,
   a real system that is introduced here. It can easily be used at home by
   the trainee without the need for external support or expensive
   equipment.
   The advantage for the SI community is that the steep learning curve,
   that often scares potential users of advanced SI methods, is flattened
   while the practical applicability of these methods is demonstrated
   altogether. The joint use of teaching material and hardware-based
   illustration provides enough knowledge, understanding and confidence to
   apply the methods on industrial scale systems.
   The first test case, which is presented here, is a mechanical setup. It
   consists of a nonlinear mass-spring-damper system built using commonly
   available components for a total cost of less than 50 Euro. When
   applying a signal with a low amplitude to the designed system, it almost
   perfectly behaves as a Linear Time Invariant (LTI) device. This is only
   true whenever the amplitude of the input signal is very small.
   Increasing the amplitude introduces weak and intuitive nonlinear
   distortions. This regime of operation is used to illustrate the analysis
   and estimation methods in a framework that closely approximates the
   theoretical assumption of periodic in, same period out (PISPO) systems.
   Increasing the amplitude even further challenges the trainees intuition
   even more. A sweep up and sweep down sine test shows that the system
   becomes bistable around the resonance peak which shifts in frequency
   with increasing amplitude of the input signal. These phenomena are
   typical for a nonlinear vibrating system containing jumps.
   The main payback for the trainee is the knowledge that well known
   Frequency Response Function (FRF) measurement of the mechanical system
   can indeed be used as an enabler for the nonlinear SI. The experiments
   shows the need for the detection, quantification and qualification of
   nonlinear effects. Existing high return local linearization methods
   {[}1]{[}2] are introduced and applied directly to the system under test.
   The major advantage of these real experiments lies in the direct visual
   feedback provided to the user under a directly usable and understandable
   format.
   A first presentation of the setup to test groups already involved in SI
   seems to indicate that the approach can strongly stimulate, motivate,
   attract and help potential users.}},

Abstract = {{The NASA Ames Research Center (NASA Ames) Center Chief Technologist
   (CCT) Office sponsors the Advanced Digital Materials and Manufacturing
   for Space (ADMMS) Initiative, which focuses on advanced manufacturing
   technologies for space, including identifying several target products,
   areas and applications, approaches for advanced manufacturing,
   mechanisms for collaboration, and complementary facilities. The pilot
   project for this initiative is the Multi-Purpose Avionics Core Element
   (M-PACE). The primary goal of M-PACE is to demonstrate advanced
   manufacturing techniques, such as additive manufacturing and Digital
   Materials, to minimize the cost of cube satellites and increase their
   modularity. M-PACE will be designed and built at the NASA Ames'
   SpaceShop, which is a state-of-the-art advanced manufacturing facility
   built for NASA researchers to formulate ideas for projects. The final
   products of M-PACE are several completed side panels of a one-unit (1U)
   (10 cm cube) cube satellite prototype built using commercial
   off-the-shelf (COTS) components, which will show the basic functionality
   of the internal payload by connecting it to the side panels for power
   and other subsystem capabilities. Within the structure, we are
   investigating the use of Digital Materials, which are universal building
   materials with the ability to increase precision and ease of assembly
   and disassembly of three dimensional (3D) objects. M-PACE will use COTS
   power systems and open-source hardware and software to distribute data
   through Ethernet through the use of snap-fit card connectors. Similar to
   Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) Express cards, we envision the
   spacecraft subsystems and payloads to be on a PC104-like board that will
   slide into the side panel connectors to enable distribution of power and
   data. This design has the potential to greatly reduce the cost of Cube
   Satellite testing and integration due to the absence of wires and ease
   of access to internal boards for any necessary modifications.}},

Abstract = {{Global warming is an issue that keeps coming up recently with the
   increase of temperature and carbon dioxide level. Scientist believes
   that the main cause of this is because of the deforestation, pollution,
   carbon emission from transportation and factories that led to this
   global warming. However, there are also skeptics that believe otherwise.
   To prove the cause of global warming and whether it is an event that
   occurs every now and then as some skeptics and scientists suggested a
   multi sensor device is build, which consist of temperature, humidity,
   carbon dioxide and oxygen. With limited funding and a few different
   location to be tested to prove this phenomena, a low cost device is
   built so that it will be within the budget of this project as well give
   the result that is to determine whether development has cause the global
   warming and forest and absorbing the CO2 emission to keep the world
   cool. Thanks to open source hardware, the sensor system can be build
   economically.}},

Abstract = {{As externally bonded fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) is a critical
   load-bearing component of strengthened or retrofitted civil
   infrastructures, the betterment of structural health monitoring (SHM)
   methodology for such composites is imperative. Henceforth the
   vibrational characteristics of near surface interfacial defects
   involving delamination and trapped air pockets at the FRP-concrete
   interface are investigated in this study using a finite element
   approach. Intuitively, due to its lower interfacial stiffness compared
   with an intact interface, a damaged region is expected to have a set of
   resonance frequencies different from an intact region when excited by
   acoustic waves. It has been observed that, when excited acoustically,
   both the vibrational amplitudes and frequency peaks in the response
   spectrum of the defects demonstrate a significant deviation from an
   intact FRP-bonded region. For a thin sheet of FRP bonded to concrete
   with sizable interfacial defects, the fundamental mode under free
   vibration is shown to be relatively low, in the order of kHz. Due to the
   low resonance frequencies of the defects, the use of low-cost equipment
   for interfacial defect detection via response spectrum analysis is
   highly feasible.}},

   magnetic field coupling is explored, to provide Time of Flight

   system. In particular, the proposed approach can be easily implemented
   using very low-cost hardware, despite the good performance that can be
   obtained. Experimental results show very good short-term stability;
   standard deviation of consecutive signal burst inter-arrival time is in
   the sub-nanosecond region. The results have been compared with a similar
   commercial solution using low frequency wakeup receiver; in this case,
   standard deviation of signal bursts inter-arrival times is on the order

   technologies whose aim is to improve the quality of life of people in
   the home environment, especially for the elderly and physically
   impaired. In particular, the present work is focused on the development
   of technological support aimed at improving the daily life of that
   population segment who has motor difficulties, and is forced to use
   personal mobility support systems such as a wheelchair. This system is
   able to localize the wheelchair while it is moving in an indoor

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new data-driven bottom-up monitoring approach
   for distribution systems. Unlike model-based techniques, which require a
   given number of measurement inputs for their state estimation equations,
   this approach uses an artificial neural network to directly estimate the
   voltages. Thus, the process does not use state estimation equations and
   is flexible with regard to the number of required measurements.
   Depending on the available measurements, the estimation accuracy may
   vary but there are no convergence issues. Furthermore, rather than
   performing voltage estimations for the entire system in a single step,
   this approach uses a hierarchical, bottom-up structure to build up the
   overall picture. More precisely, the estimations performed at the MV/LV
   substations are communicated to the upper-level HV/MV substation,
   contributing to more accurate voltage estimation at MV level. The
   estimation process is computationally simple and can be executed on
   low-cost hardware, as demonstrated in this work. In our test, BeagleBone
   Black was used for implementing the developed algorithm. Preliminary
   results are presented which show representative estimations in an LV
   feeder.}},

   Using UV Spectroscopy and Chemometrics Methods}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL METHODS IN CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{The fungus species Wolfiporia extensa has a long history of medicinal
   usage and has also been commercially used to formulate nutraceuticals
   and functional foods in certain Asian countries. In the present study, a
   practical and promising method has been developed to discriminate the
   dried sclerotium of . extensa collected from different geographical
   sites based on UV spectroscopy together with chemometrics methods.
   Characteristic fingerprint of low polar constituents of sample extracts
   that originated from chloroform has been obtained in the interval
   250-400 nm. Chemometric pattern recognition methods such as partial
   least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and hierarchical cluster
   analysis (HCA) were applied to enhance the authenticity of
   discrimination of the specimens. The results showed that W. extensa
   samples were well classified according to their geographical origins.
   The proposed method can fully utilize diversified fingerprint
   characteristics of sclerotium of W. extensa and requires low-cost
   equipment and short-time analysis in comparison with other techniques.
   Meanwhile, this simple and efficient method may serve as a basis for the
   authentication of other medicinal fungi.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explains the design of a communication system, using an
   Arduino microcontroller and GSM Module and its functions / associated
   components to be implemented in a microgrid. The microgrid control and
   coordination infrastructure has been realized as a hierarchical
   multi-agent system (MAS) comprising of the DG agents, the Mu agent and
   the D agent. The Communication (Mu) Agent acts as a link between the
   lower-level microgrid agents (distributed energy resources (DERs), the
   load, the storage and the utility grid) which provide the required
   digital parameter inputs, and the Control Agent comprising of the Cloud.
   Data storage, analytics and control commands are generated based on the
   rule engine updates given by the Utility Service Provider (USP) to the
   Cloud. The microgrid side input data are converted into appropriate GPRS
   signals within the Arduino. The specific functions that enable this
   conversion are elucidated as pseudocode. Further, the cloud control
   commands are sent back to the various microgrid-side agents via the Mu
   agent as GPRS signals. The communication strategy has been explained in
   detail and has been implemented using Arduino keeping in mind system
   costs, ease of operability and maintenance.}},

Abstract = {{The Abbey of Santa Maria extra moenia is a historical complex located in
   the Marche region (Italy). It has undergone substantial transformations
   over the centuries. For this reason, the historical and critical
   interpretation requires a key capable of simplifying the understanding
   of all the modifications.
   Starting from both an archival study and an architectural survey, we
   created different 3D models to help analyze and understand all the
   historical and architectural phases of the complex. The 3D-model
   reconstructions are based on metric and land surveys. The survey
   permitted us to identify seven main historical phases. In this way
   knowledge of the abbey becomes an elaborate history that needs an
   appropriate dissemination tool. The abbey is now abandoned due to its
   poor state and no action has been taken for its improvement or
   preservation. A first step in raising awareness of this forgotten
   cultural object is to foster better knowledge of its history through a
   new visual interface that is able to clarify all the events that have
   occurred over time. In order to explain the complex history of the
   abbey, we tested a new approach based on the use of a mock-up as a
   physical interface allowing access to different digital content. For
   this purpose we used open-source hardware: an Arduino-based
   microcontroller, named Makey Makey, connected to different parts of the
   mock-up through wired buttons. In this way, the computer processes the
   signal coming from the buttons using the mock-up like a keyboard to
   manage all the information related to the abbey.}},

Abstract = {{While cornerstone and capstone courses teach ``design{''} at the
   beginning and end of many computer engineering programs, a design gap is
   left in the sophomore and junior years. This paper describes the
   development and experiences of teaching five semesters of a specialized
   design course for a computer engineering program taught in the junior
   year. The course includes topics in software design patterns,
   multi-threaded applications, rudimentary user-interface design, embedded
   programming including sensor building and processing, and Zigbee-based
   wireless communications. The course is 2 semester credits (1-2-3), and
   includes a comprehensive project that requires students to build a
   tangible game or a game-like entertainment system. One key component of
   the course is the use of an open-source hardware platform called
   Arduino. The results are that students enjoy the course and are able to
   build integrated systems that incorporate design patterns,
   multi-threading, embedded programming and wireless communication in an
   effective manner within one semester.}},

Abstract = {{As technology scales, the hardware reliability challenge affects a broad
   computing market, rendering traditional redundancy based solutions too
   expensive. Software anomaly based hardware error detection has emerged
   as a low cost reliability solution, but suffers from Silent Data
   Corruptions (SDCs). It is crucial to accurately evaluate SDC rates and
   identify SDC producing software locations to develop software-centric
   low-cost hardware resiliency solutions.
   A recent tool, called Relyzer, systematically analyzes an entire
   application's resiliency to single bit soft-errors using a small set of
   carefully selected error injection sites. Relyzer provides a practical
   resiliency evaluation mechanism but still requires significant
   evaluation time, most of which is spent on error simulations.
   This paper presents a new technique called GangES (Gang Error Simulator)
   that aims to reduce error simulation time. GangES observes that a set or
   gang of error simulations that result in the same intermediate execution
   state (after their error injections) will produce the same error
   outcome; therefore, only one simulation of the gang needs to be
   completed, resulting in significant overall savings in error simulation
   time. GangES leverages program structure to carefully select when to
   compare simulations and what state to compare. For our workloads, GangES
   saves 57\% of the total error simulation time with an overhead of just
   1.6\%.
   This paper also explores pure program analyses based techniques that
   could obviate the need for tools such as GangES altogether. The
   availability of Relyzer+GangES allows us to perform a detailed
   evaluation of such techniques. We evaluate the accuracy of several
   previously proposed program metrics. We find that the metrics we
   considered and their various linear combinations are unable to
   adequately predict an instruction's vulnerability to SDCs, further
   motivating the use of Relyzer+GangES style techniques as valuable
   solutions for the hardware error resiliency evaluation problem.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSNs) are considered as one of the
   most prominent infrastructures for human-centric multimedia applications
   due to the wide availability of low-cost hardware such as microphones

   alongside the explicit highly demanding bandwidth requirements of
   real-time multimedia applications, these particular networks foster a
   set of non-trivial challenges that need to be confronted. In this paper
   we define a level of relevance in regards with the content of a

   that optimizes the overall network performance in terms of energy
   efficiency and packet delay. We present the design, implementation and
   applicability of our Content Relevance Opportunistic Routing (CROR)

Abstract = {{The future of air traffic control (ATC) will heavily depend on the
   Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) protocol as a
   crucial component. ADS-B marks a paradigm change in airspace monitoring
   as global ATC is switching from an independent, radar-based approach to
   dependent, satellite-supported surveillance. With ADS-B, aircraft
   broadcast their own position and other information in short periodic
   messages to other aircraft and control stations on the ground. As the
   protocol is becoming mandatory in most airspaces over the next years, it
   is important that its characteristics and challenges are thoroughly
   investigated. The large-scale ADS-B data required to do this has not
   been openly accessible until now, as specialized and expensive
   infrastructure was needed. We demonstrate OpenSky, a sensor network
   based on low-cost hardware connected over the Internet, which enables
   real-world experimental studies.
   OpenSky works with off-the-shelf sensors run by volunteers distributed
   over Central Europe. Currently comprising 11 sensors, the sensor network
   covers an area of 720,000 km(2). We capture more than 30\% of Europe's
   commercial air traffic, offering access to billions of ADS-B messages.}},

Abstract = {{EU Directive 2008/96/EC on road infrastructure safety management
   requires the implementation of procedures relating to road safety impact
   assessments, road safety audits, the management of road network safety
   and safety inspections. Despite the increasing role of Safety Inspection
   (SI), due to the qualitative nature of the approach, management issues
   remain in the use of SI as source of information to prioritize those
   measures and sections with the highest benefit-cost ratio. Based on
   these considerations and starting from the results of IASP EU research
   project, a Safety Risk Index (SRI) has been formulated as measure of
   risk that uses Safety Inspection as primary source of information. To
   improve the quality and efficiency of the periodic inspections of road
   network, a system of software tools based on low cost equipment have
   been developed. Firstly, a tool was developed for an android tablet to
   allow infield inspections,. After the inspection phase another tool is
   used in the office to make a review of the inspection and to carry out
   the SRI. Finally a tool was implemented in order to prioritize the
   intervention works that produce the greatest safety benefits.}},

Abstract = {{The data centre at the Galician Institute of High Energy Physics (IGFAE)
   of the Santiago de Compostela University (USC) is a computing cluster
   with about 150 nodes and 1250 cores that hosts the LHCb Tiers 2 and 3.
   In this small data centre, and of course in similar or bigger ones, it
   is very important to keep optimal conditions of temperature, humidity
   and pressure. Therefore, it is a necessity to monitor the environment
   and be able to trigger alarms when operating outside the recommended
   settings.
   There are currently many tools and systems developed for data centre
   monitoring, but until recent years all of them were of commercial nature
   and expensive. In recent years there has been an increasing interest in
   the use of technologies based on Arduino due to its open hardware
   licensing and the low cost of this type of components. In this article
   we describe the system developed to monitor IGFAE's data centre, which
   integrates an Arduino controlled sensor network with the Nagios
   monitoring software. Sensors of several types, temperature, humidity and
   pressure, are connected to the Arduino board. The Nagios software is in
   charge of monitoring the various sensors and, with the help of
   Nagiosgraph, to keep track of the historic data and to produce the
   plots. An Arduino program, developed in house, provides the Nagios
   plugin with the readout of one or several sensors depending on the
   plugin's request. The Nagios plugin for reading the temperature sensors
   also broadcasts an SNMP trap when the temperature gets out of the
   allowed operating range.}},

Abstract = {{The developing world remains plagued by lack of access to safe drinking
   water. Although many low-cost methods have been developed to treat

   necessary to determine if these appropriate technologies are needed,
   effective, and reliable. This paper provides a methodology for the
   design, development, and technical validation of a low-cost, open-source
   (OS) water testing platform. A case study is presented where the
   platform is developed to provide both the colorimetry for biochemical
   oxygen demand/chemical oxygen demand and nephelometry to measure
   turbidity using method ISO 7027. This approach resulted in equipment
   that is as accurate, but costs between 7.5 and 15 times less than
   current commercially available tools. It is concluded that OS hardware
   development is a promising solution for the equipment necessary to
   perform water quality measurements in both developed and developing

Abstract = {{The lack of adequate near-surface observations of the stable atmospheric

   validation of the car measurements are performed using controlled field
   experiments and a comparison with an instrumented tower. The corrections
   required to remove the effects of the car motion are shown to be smaller
   and simpler than the corrections for research aircraft measurements. A
   car can therefore satisfactorily measure near-surface turbulence using
   relatively low-cost equipment. Other natural advantages of a car, such
   as the ability to drive on any road at any time of day or night and
   follow the terrain slope, as well as its low cost of operation, make it
   applicable to observations of a variety of flow regimes that cannot be

Journal = {{ANALYTICAL METHODS}},

Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{13}},
Pages = {{4652-4660}},
Abstract = {{Gas chromatography (GC) is frequently used in qualitative and
   quantitative analysis of volatile organic molecules. In its most common
   embodiment, samples are prepared in the laboratory, and injected into
   the capillary column using an autosampler. Analytes are separated, and
   detected by one of several available detection systems, including mass
   spectrometry (MS). However, this mode of operation is not convenient
   when monitoring dynamic chemical systems - for example, reaction
   mixtures. Here we present a facile approach for automated sampling, and
   subsequent introduction of samples to a GC apparatus in order to enable
   monitoring of dynamic chemical processes in real time. The proposed
   system incorporates two pinch valves, a peristaltic pump, a
   thermoshaker, and an electronic control unit (Raspberry Pi
   microcomputer) with several relays. The device facilitates dosing small
   volumes of liquid samples to the injection port of a commercial GC-MS
   apparatus. A program in C language controls the operation of the pump
   (on/off, direction of flow) and actuation of the pinch valves, and it
   initiates GC-MS runs. The system has been characterised with artificial
   samples, and successfully used in the monitoring of transesterification
   reactions catalysed by single microbeads containing immobilised lipase,
   as well as in the monitoring of the extraction of natural products from
   plant tissue samples. We believe that - following further improvements -
   this automated approach may be adapted for monitoring industrial
   processes and environmental analysis.}},

Title = {{A Real-Time Imaging System for Lumber Strength Prediction}},
Journal = {{FOREST PRODUCTS JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{3-4}},
Pages = {{126-133}},
Abstract = {{In this article, we describe a system for machine vision based lumber
   strength prediction. The system utilizes images taken from all four
   sides of pinewood boards. Those images are further divided into small
   subareas, and the local gradients inside each area are used to calculate
   the local grain direction. Together, these directions form the grain
   direction map. The grain direction map and knot features are used to
   predict the breaking strength of the board. Because of the high speed of
   production lines, we also present a parallel general-purpose graphics
   processing unit (GPGPU) implementation of the method to achieve
   real-time performance using low-cost hardware. We describe the
   challenges of the design on a GPU compared with a traditional central
   processing unit implementation. Most of the modern sawmills already have
   multiple camera systems in use, making the camera-based strength
   prediction extremely cost effective. In our experiments, an r(2) value
   of 0.63 was obtained between the measured strength attributes of the
   board and our strength prediction coefficient. The ground truth for the
   breaking strength was measured using destructive 3-point bending tests.
   Using a regular desktop computer, the described system achieves a
   throughput of over 50 Mpixels/s. For the parallel implementation, we
   provide qualitative evaluation of the results and a comparison of the
   computational speed on several platforms.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents a compact and low cost equipment for water
   desalination using electrodialysis (ED) with the aim to increase the
   lifetime of industrial machines that are installed near or above the sea
   and use seawater for cooling or operation purposes. The water
   desalinator equipment is mainly composed of four set of grills which are
   energized by applying a direct current (DC) to them. Two sets of them
   are positive charged and the other two sets are negative charged. The
   grills are charged in an alternative manner, it means that one set is
   negative charged followed by another set which is positive charged. The
   negative charged grills attract the positive charged ions which are
   calcium \& sodium, and the positive charged grills attract the negative
   charged ions which are chloride \& sulfate. The seawater was pretreated
   before and after the desalination process using an activated carbon
   filter to extract most of the suspended solids in the water. In addition
   different flow rates and voltages were applied to the experiment to
   observe the relationship between them and to find the parameters and
   variables that increase the efficiency of the desalination equipment.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses sidelobe reduction of an antenna array pattern for
   reducing effects of ground or sea clutter of zenith-looking wind

   radar. It is shown that minimal low-cost hardware modifications to
   existing compact ground planes of the 915-MHz radar allow for reduction
   of sidelobes of up to 5 dB. The results obtained on a single array are
   extended to a 449-MHz triple hexagonal array interferometric radar.
   Cross-correlation, transmit beam width, and sidelobe levels are
   evaluated for various clutter fence configurations and array spacings.
   The resulting sidelobes are as much as 10 dB below those without a

Abstract = {{Estimating the input-output behavior of low voltage powerline channels
   for indoor high speed data communications requires the availability of
   proper wideband channel sounding tools. In fact, the properties of real
   world powerline channels are substantially different from those commonly
   exhibited by their wireless counterparts, so that standard methods for
   wireless channel sounding cannot be adapted to a powerline scenario. In
   this paper, after providing some general design guidelines for powerline
   channel sounding, a detailed description of a FPGA-based implementation
   of a wideband powerline channel sounder is provided. Such a tool is
   based on low cost hardware and is flexible, since it can be easily
   customized to user needs using a set of simple graphical user
   interfaces. Some of its specific applications, namely the estimation of
   the time-varying transfer function of an indoor powerline channel and
   the evaluation of the power spectral density of the noise affecting it,
   are illustrated to show the potentialities of the developed equipment.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE TOOLS \& MANUFACTURE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{76}},
Pages = {{1-12}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In the machining program for free form surfaces, the tool path is
   usually represented as continuous short lines. For the computer
   numerical control, the feedrate profile for short line tool path should
   be smooth and optimized in order to achieve high machining quality and
   high speed. In high speed machining, the feedrate profile also has a
   strong influence on contour accuracy. This paper presents a new
   real-time smooth feedrate planning algorithm for short line tool path,
   in which the contour error constraint is included. To realize contour
   error control, the feedrate is adaptively adjusted based on the
   curvature radius of the tool path, which is directly estimated from the
   short lines. The 7-phase jerk-limited look-ahead planning is employed to
   generate a smooth feedrate profile. The target feedrate filter (TFF) and
   planning units merging techniques are developed to improve the
   smoothness of the feedrate profile and reduce the overhead on
   look-ahead. The advantage of the proposed algorithm is that it is not
   only convenient to achieve the balance among accuracy, smoothness and
   productivity by adjusting parameters, but also efficient in design,
   which makes it possible to be implemented on low cost hardware
   platforms. Experiment results demonstrate the feasibility of the
   proposed algorithm on smooth feedrate planning and contour error control
   for continuous short line tool path. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   line, triangle and curve rasterization modules. This paper is only
   focused on the improvement of line rasterization speed. Besides
   modifying the algorithm itself, hardware implementation and resource
   consumption are put into consideration here. Originally, ORGFX uses the
   classic Bresenham line algorithm with high precision and simple logic to
   rasterize lines, but this algorithm can only generate one pixel in each
   rasterization process, which results in efficiency relatively low. New
   algorithm in this paper combines Bresenham algorithm with the symmetry
   nature of lines, advantages of Bresenham algorithm are kept and
   rasterization speed is improved in this way. The results of experiments
   show that nearly 50 percent of time can be saved through software
   implementation and hardware implementation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we discuss the motivation and challenges raised by the
   desire to consider the morphology as an experimental variable on real
   robotic platforms as well as allowing reproducibility and diffusion in
   the scientific community. In this context, we present an alternative
   design and production methodology that we have applied to the conception
   of Poppy, the first complete 3D printed open-source and open-hardware
   humanoid robot. Robust and accessible, it allows exploring quickly and
   easily the fabrication, the programming and the experimentation of
   various robotic morphologies. Both hardware and software are
   open-source, and a web platform allows interdisciplinary contributions,
   sharing and collaborations. Finally we conduct an experiment to explore
   the impact of four different foot morphologies on the robot's dynamic
   when it makes a footstep. We show that such experimentation can easily
   be achieved and shared in couple of days at almost no cost.}},

Abstract = {{Time synchronization plays an important role in wireless sensor networks
   (WSNs). Due to the unique features of WSNs such as remote deployment,
   low-cost hardware, and restrictive energy supply, accurate and robust
   time synchronization is still a challenging task. Many approaches have
   been proposed to improve the performance and efficiency of time
   synchronization. Existing schemes, however, do not pay enough attention
   to the impacts of varying network topology properties, including network
   diameter, degree distribution, and the like. They can experience
   unexpected performance degradation in many real systems.
   To address these issues, we present a novel approach, which tries to
   improve the performance of existing time synchronization algorithms by
   introducing a virtual overlay. We propose an integrated model, called
   topo-refiner, which encodes the impact of different network topology
   features to the precision and robustness of time synchronization. Also,
   we design a novel optimization algorithm to build a virtual overlay from
   the underlying communication network. Our approach is orthogonal to
   existing clock synchronization methods, and can improve their
   performance by operating these methods atop the virtual layer. Finally,
   in order to verify the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct
   extensive simulations on synthetic and real system traces, as well as
   testbed experiments. Results show that topo-refiner is practical, and
   quickly adapts to varying time synchronization accuracy requirements for
   applications in WSNs.}},

Abstract = {{The prime objective of any technological innovation is to improve the
   life of people. Technological innovation in the field of medical devices
   directly touches the lives of millions of people; not just patients but
   doctors and other technicians as well. Serving these care givers is
   serving humanity. Growth of Mobil Devices and Cloud Computing has
   changed the way we live and work. We try to bring the benefits of these
   technological innovations to the medical field via equipment which can
   improve the working efficiencies and capabilities of the medical
   professionals and technicians. The improvements in the camera and image
   processing capabilities of the Mobile Devices coupled with their
   improved processing power and an infinite processing and storage offered
   by Cloud Computing infrastructure opens up a window of opportunity to
   use them in the specialized field like microsurgery. To enable
   microsurgery, surgeons use optical microscope to zoom into the working
   area to get better visibility and control. However, these devices suffer
   from various drawbacks and are not comfortable to use. We build a Tablet
   with large stereoscopic screen allowing glasses free 3D display enabled
   by cameras capable of capturing 3D video and enhanced by an image
   processing pipeline, greatly improves the visibility and viewing comfort
   of the surgeon. Moreover using the capabilities of Cloud computing,
   these surgeries can be recorded and streamed live for education,
   training and consultation. An expert sitting in a geographically remote
   location can guide the surgeon performing the surgery. All vital
   parameters of the patient undergoing surgery can be shown as an overlay
   on the Tablet screen so that the surgeon is alerted of any parameter
   going beyond limit. Developing this kind of complex device involves
   engineering skills in hardware and software and huge amount of
   investments in terms of time, resources and money. To accelerate the
   development, we make use of open source hardware and software and
   demonstrate how we can accelerate the development using these open
   source resources.}},

Abstract = {{A Biomedical Signal Processing (BSP) laboratory course has a cost
   associated with its implementation and maintenance. This cost can
   sometimes be a barrier to be overcome by institutions intending to
   launch their own comprehensive laboratories for the processing and
   analysis of biomedical signals (biosignals). As a result, when it comes
   to BSP, many courses are designed to provide the students with a dry and
   theoretical application of mathematical methods only, forgetting to
   focus on hands-on projects to boost the students' learning curve. This
   work in progress describes the design process of a comprehensive BSP
   laboratory course using low-cost hardware and software. We describe the
   methods utilized to generate the documentation needed for the course,
   and also a detailed list of the materials used and their main features.
   We divided the design process in two main categories: 1) analog circuit
   design; and 2) digital signal processing and software development. We
   provide details about these two categories and subdivide the structure
   of the course into seven laboratory experiments to be completed
   individually or by a group of students. After the completion of this
   project, a collection of seven laboratory guides will be fully designed
   and this hands-on BSP course will be ready to be disseminated and
   implemented. In addition, all the materials and documentation created
   throughout this project are periodically uploaded into the group's Smart
   System online webpage
   (http://smartsystems.eng.fau.edu/biomedical-signal-processing/) for easy
   and free access.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid advancement of low cost embedded systems invites engineering
   educators to deliver content and skills while engaging students in
   hands-on projects that may potentially make use of a variety of
   platforms. From proprietary to open source hardware and software, from
   microcontrollers to embedded operating systems (OS) devices, students
   today are challenged to accelerate their learning pace by working on
   real-world projects in a supervised environment. Currently, students
   rely on self-guidance in order to develop the knowledge base necessary
   for achieving the goals of their team projects with respect to embedded
   systems. This paper presents the results of an embedded systems
   programming tutorial piloted with a group of 15 undergraduate students
   from across the engineering disciplines and with a mix of sophomores
   through seniors. The tutorial included a series of three lecture modules
   prepared to introduce concepts on embedded systems. The modules were
   tightly coupled with hands-on exercises that employed the DE2i-150
   development board, aimed to introduce students to the development of
   digital systems based on an Altera field programmable gate array (FPGA)
   in conjunction with an Linux-based embedded OS running on an Intel Atom
   processor. The first module provides an overview of the various inputs,
   outputs, sensors, and displays of the board. The second module
   introduces the embedded OS and guides students in establishing a
   high-speed Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) link between
   the Atom processor and the FPGA. The third module focuses on
   implementing a custom C/++ application written by students for real-time
   processing of inputs from four push buttons. Results show that the three
   lecture modules of 30 minutes each, coupled with the hands-on projects,
   offer a good introduction to the complexity of the DE2i-150 board.
   Surveys collected before the first module and after the third show a
   generally positive outcome. Recommendations for future efforts focus on
   incorporating more complex C/++ applications concurrent with FPGA
   development.}},

Abstract = {{In teaching undergraduate automatic controls, the laboratory experience
   is an important and irreplaceable component. Historically, good
   platforms for a controls laboratory have been expensive, because the
   equipment has typically been very specialized for educational purposes.
   Moreover, the equipment often is not physically robust in the face of
   student manhandling, creating major difficulties and costs in
   maintaining such a lab. The advent of inexpensive open-source controller
   hardware is revolutionizing this situation because it is now possible to
   have good controls-hardware capability at relatively low cost. The
   Arduino Mega 2560, in particular, is supported by Matlab, Simulink and
   LabView, and thus provides a great deal of flexibility in developing
   laboratory procedures for students to study controls.
   The Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on
   flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. The ``motor shield{''} is
   an add-on (daughterboard) to the Arduino that further enables control of
   dc motors. This paper explains a method and hardware to connect an
   Arduino to a separately-powered dc-motor unit. Matlab and Simulink
   provide full support of the Arduino board for feedback-controller
   design. The Arduino board is powered by, and communicates with Simulink,
   through a standard USB connection.}},

Abstract = {{The pedagogical literature has consistently and repeatedly shown that
   active learning is more effective than passive learning in teaching
   students fundamental engineering concepts, yet the lecture persists as
   the primary method of classroom organization for the vast majority of
   professors. Even among those professors who have read the literature and
   are willing to change their teaching methods, a barrier to adoption of
   active learning strategies is the time and effort required to develop
   the classroom activities for a particular course. This paper describes a
   series of experiments that can be done in class with low-cost equipment
   in an introductory circuits course. In each class period, a brief
   lecture at the beginning of the course went over the relative circuit
   theory, such as Ohm's Law and Kirchoff's laws. Then the instructor
   worked out a numerical example for a given circuit. Finally the students
   are instructed to build a circuit corresponding the example problem and
   make the necessary measurements to verify the theory. The class was
   divided into teams of four students each, and each team was given an
   equipment pack during the first week of class. The equipment packs
   included a budget digital multimeter (DMM), a number of resistors, a
   capacitor, LED, hobby-size DC motor, 9V battery, and lead wires with
   alligator clips for connecting the components. Students were instructed
   to bring the equipment packs to class every day, and they were also
   given homework assignments that required the use of the equipment packs.
   Though some breakage will occur and batteries may be accidentally
   discharged, the equipment packs can be re-used from year to year. Once
   the initial investment has been made, further upgrades with additional
   components can also be done in subsequent years. This paper contains a
   complete list of experiments that can easily be implemented by other
   instructors, and is also suitable for use in ``flipped{''} classrooms.}},

Abstract = {{Improving energy efficiency of Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning
   (HVAC) systems is a primary objective for the society. Model Predictive
   Control (MPC) techniques for HVAC systems have recently received
   particular attention, since they can naturally account for several
   factors, such as weather and occupancy forecasts, comfort ranges and
   actuation constraints. Developing effective MPC based control strategies
   for HVAC systems is nontrivial, since buildings dynamics are nonlinear
   and affected by various uncertainties. Further, the complexity of the
   MPC problem and the burden of on-line computations can lead to
   difficulties in integrating this scheme into a building management
   system.
   We propose to address this computational issue by designing a
   scenario-based explicit MPC strategy, i.e., a controller that is
   simultaneously based on explicit representations of the MPC feedback law
   and accounts for uncertainties in the occupancy patterns and weather
   conditions by using the scenarios paradigm. The main advantages of this
   approach are the absence of a-priori assumptions on the distributions of
   the uncertain variables, the applicability to any type of building, and
   the limited on-line computational burden, enabling practical
   implementations on low-cost hardware platforms.
   We illustrate the practical implementation of the proposed explicit MPC
   controller on a room of a university building, showing its effectiveness
   and computational tractability.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explains the implementation of a low cost, non-intrusive home
   energy monitoring system. The design implementation of the proof of
   concept employs open-source hardware architecture using Arduino and
   off-the-shelf sensors which lends itself to mass production, low cost
   and easy maintenance. This system is intended to service rural and low
   income urban consumers who will not be able to afford existing
   sophisticated and expensive home automation systems. A device
   identification module (DIM) that recognizes the devices in use at every
   room is implemented. The energy usage is continuously monitored and the
   user is notified of his consumption over a twenty four hour period. As
   many of the intended users are possible first time energy consumers, the
   energy monitoring system will inculcate a sense of energy consciousness
   and ensure grass root level sustainability. The energy consumption data
   is logged in the system and can be used by the utility service provider
   (USP) for future system planning, optimization and demand side
   management. The proof of concept developed and tested under laboratory
   conditions costs under USD 11 and will reduce further on
   commercialization.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new methodology proposal and hands-on activities
   in the Introduction to Computer Engineering (ICE) course, based on open
   hardware platforms. The proposal has been adopted in the Computer
   Engineering undergraduate program at the Federal University of Mato
   Grosso do Sul (UFMS) - Brazil. Most of the ICE courses from computer
   engineering programs around the world have put focus on teaching initial
   basic theoretical concepts of algorithms, logic, and digital systems.
   The ICE course at UFMS has been organized to encompass from initial
   basic concepts up to a practical and motivating set of experimental
   activities in order to clarify the program focus and to connect the
   concepts to practical applications. To evaluate the impacts of this new
   curriculum and methodology, an online anonymous survey has been carried
   out with students from 2011, 2012, and 2013 classes. After a statistical
   analysis and validation of the answers, 28\% of the students have
   pointed that the activities have been determinant to increase their
   motivation to study computer engineering. The impacts on students
   motivation, since the first semester, have been observed in the students
   evasion rate. The percentage of evasions in the computer engineering is
   less than other engineering programs at UFMS.}},

Abstract = {{With mobile and wireless devices becoming pervasive, the low-cost
   hardware implementations of security functions are being desired. A
   compact hardware implementation of SM3 hash algorithm is presented in
   this paper. A SRAM is used to do message expansion function instead of
   shift registers which are used in common hardware implementations, and
   the computation units are saved as much as possible. In addition, the
   values of A similar to H and V0 similar to V7 registers are updated in
   serial shift way when they are initialized and updated. Compared to
   traditional designs, the store resources for message expansion function
   can be shared with other modules to reduce the cost of a system. The
   Synopsys' DC synthesis results show that the area of the compact SM3 is
   approximate 9822 GEs while its throughput can be as high as 276 Mbps. If
   the SRAM can be shared with other modules, only 7806 GEs are additional
   required to add the SM3 hardware module in the system. The compact
   architecture can be accommodated to resource-constrained systems for its
   advantages of low-cost and low-power.}},

Abstract = {{To achieve a target bit-rate reduction of 50\% over H.264/AVC while

   Coding (HEVC) includes several new coding tools including a new set of
   integer transforms. Since these transforms are more complex than the
   H.264/AVC transforms, it is more challenging to design and develop
   high-performance integer transform hardware for HEVC. In this paper, we
   propose a series of high-throughput and low-cost hardware-oriented HEVC
   transform algorithms by using a butterfly structure and replacing
   multiplications by additions and shift operations in a way that
   minimizes critical computation paths. Compared to the algorithms using
   other methodologies like multiplierless multiple constant multiplication
   (MMCM) or decomposition to sparse matrices, our algorithms achieve
   around 20\% shorter critical paths while consuming relatively small
   numbers of additions and shift operations. Hardware designs applying our
   proposed algorithms can increase their throughput by 20\% while
   maintaining a reasonable resource consumption compared to when applying
   other algorithms.}},

   wide range of object properties and significant sensing errors.
   Underactuation and compliance have been shown to be an effective way to
   improve grasping performance under such uncertainty, but the degree of
   compliance plays an important role in both gently adapting to sensing
   errors and maintaining stable grasps of heavy objects. These demands
   limit the range of objects that can be grasped. We consider the role and
   required characteristics of tactile sensing as a compensation method
   when compliance alone is insufficient. By strategic use of contact
   sensing, it is possible to expand the capabilities of a hand to grasp
   effectively under a wide range of positioning errors using simple
   position-driven motors and low-cost hardware.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper the model for real-time monitoring of selected premises is
   presented and implemented as a web based interactive interface while
   utilizing open-source hardware. The rudimentary idea is based on the
   capabilities offered by contemporary web technology which enables the
   development of complex and interactive solutions - essential for our
   purpose is HTML5 and JavaScript technology. Approach we take
   incorporates three major parts - model design, interface design and
   monitoring tool development, when combined together they provide
   interface for monitoring within personal intranet or over the internet.
   Primary outputs provide the ability to monitor the movement and count
   the number of individuals. Solution presented in this paper may be
   extended to entire monitoring system consisted of multiple nodes.}},

Abstract = {{Evolution of very low-cost hardware, viz. low-resolution CMOS cameras
   and microphones, facilitating the retrieval of multimedia content from
   the environment, has prompted the conception of wireless multimedia
   sensor networks (WMSNs). Sensor nodes' energy consumption is still one
   of the main concerns while improving the network lifetime of the network
   and clustering has been proved an important tool in this regard.
   However, the directionally constrained sensing nature of nodes in one
   type of WMSN turned the routing solutions of wireless sensor networks
   (WSNs) inapplicable for WMSN. This paper proposes an energy-saving
   hierarchical clustering based on overlapping field-of-views (FoVs) of
   nodes in WMSN in presence of arbitrarily located obstacles within the
   network area. Performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated through
   simulation primarily to analyze the effect of obstacle in network area
   over clustering. Finally the efficacy of the scheme is measured in terms
   of network lifetime where results clearly show the present scheme's
   supremacy compared to one FoV based clustering with no hierarchy and the
   other with no clustering at all.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the state-of-the-art for building a low cost mobile
   robot with open-source technology based on sensor fusion. Designing
   open-source educational robots has a great impact on empowering
   engineers and those interested in mobile robots. In the last decade,
   different robots have been designed and built for this purpose. In this
   project, with the help of sensors available on a 9-axis open-source IMU
   and a robot based on open-source hardware and control software, a
   graphical user interface has been implemented to view the condition of
   motion variables in a real-time manner and combine sensor data.
   Moreover, by implementing different filter programs, such as low-pass
   filter, complementary filter and by using KF implementation and
   deliberation this mobile robot becomes suitable for improving the
   accuracy of the robot in extracting parameters required for
   localization, mapping and robot navigation. Features of the developed
   robot, the so-called TL-OSR, can be regarded as: using open-source
   hardware and software with real-time performance, low price equipment,
   presenting a solution based on sensor fusion for better accuracy in
   robot navigation and using different types of sensors. This robot can be
   used as an suitable open-source platform as a new class of mobile robots
   for educational and research purposes in mechatronics and robotics.}},

Abstract = {{Computer numerical control (CNC) machines play a central role in modern
   manufacturing. CNC machining skills provide high-paying manufacturing
   jobs to graduates of engineering and technology. Hands-on laboratory
   instruction is essential for effective student learning in the area of
   CAD/CAM/Manufacturing Technology, but the high cost of commercial and
   even educational CNC machines like mills and lathes constrains the scope
   of instruction in CNC machining. In this paper, an inexpensive two-axis
   lathe prototype is developed using off-the-shelf materials and
   components, open source hardware, and open source CAM and CNC software.
   The machine can be adapted for large scale use in engineering colleges,
   polytechnics, and industrial training institutes (ITIs). To make the CNC
   learning even more affordable, accessible and less resource-intensive, a
   web-based learning platform for using the lathe is developed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design and implementation of an OpenRISC-based
   System-on-Chip (SoC), which is composed of hardware cores implementing
   the Digital Signal Processing (DSP) functions: Finite Impulse Response
   (FIR) filter, Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filter and Fast Fourier
   Transform (FFT). The FIR-filter core is based on the transpose
   realization form, the IIR-filter core is based on the Second Order
   Sections (SOS) architecture and the FFT core is based on the Radix 2(2)
   Single Delay Feedback (R2(2) SDF) architecture. The three cores are
   compatible with the Wishbone SoC bus, and they were described using
   generic and structural VHDL. In-system hardware verification was
   performed by using an OpenRisc-based SoC synthesized on an Altera FPGA.
   Tests showed that the designed DSP cores are suitable for building SoC
   based on the OpenRisc processor and the Wishbone bus.}},

Abstract = {{We have detected a great gap between teaching of structural mechanics
   and the real world applications related with this subject. The European
   Space of Higher Education requires a higher proportion of practical
   content in courses, so that students can develop skills to solve real
   problems in the development of their professional practice. Therefore,
   we have the challenge of develop new laboratory practices to reduce the
   gap between theoretical contents of the classes and the aforementioned
   real world applications.
   When we faced with this problem, we realized that usual commercial
   equipments for educational laboratories are quite limited in flexibility
   and are often quite expensive. In this work we show how we have
   implemented the practices for a structural mechanics course in the
   second year of civil engineering studies using open hardware solutions.
   For this purpose we built our own devices and involved students from
   different courses and specialties, including undergraduate researchers
   in the development of the different mechanical and electronic
   components. The main aim of the present work has been the creation of a
   self-teaching experience for students, where they can freely build the
   models, interact with the sensors and check the correlation between the
   theoretical models and the practical results.}},

Abstract = {{Robotics teaching is nowadays limited by the expensiveness of the
   electronic material required. In this paper, a new low-cost, user
   friendly robotic system has been developed. This system provides an
   advanced mobile robotics teaching frame using cheap hardware and
   software resources. This platform consists on a little mobile robot able
   to navigate through the environment avoiding obstacles and performing a
   map of its surrounding. This system performs these tasks using open
   hardware and software tools. The robot, made from an Arduino board,
   cheap sensors, motors and wheels, has been programmed using C++ language
   on Arduino and ROS. The system communicates in real time with a PC where
   the map is drawn using OpenCV libraries.
   Regarding to the hardware, the robot has the structure of a PopBot-168
   Arduino kit, which consists of a circular structure and two motors
   connected to their corresponding wheels. The robot also has two encoders
   and a magnetometer to perform location task. The processor is an Arduino
   Mega board. The system features two infrared sensors that get the
   distances of robot's environment in every directions due to a servomotor
   that moves them.
   The developed robot is able to perform a map of its environment and draw
   it in a computer. The communication between the robot and the computer
   is performed using ROS. This project has managed to introduce a ROS node
   on the Arduino board. In the computer there are another two nodes, one
   for draw the map and another which decide where to move.
   Finally, as experimental results, an example of how the robot works
   building a 2-dimensional reconstruction from an environment is shown.
   Students can learn about the problem of auto-location and other
   difficulties due to robotics itself. It is also a very good mechanism to
   learn from the beginning to design, assemble and program a mobile robot;
   use and gather data from the sensors.}},

Abstract = {{``Music education is, in its nature, human and essentially serves to
   awaken and develop human capacities.{''} This phrase by Edgar Willems
   (1890-1978) serves as a starting point in the design, implementation,
   tuning and validation of a digital interface for teaching and musical
   creation with children from 3 years old, visually impaired or affected
   by Autism Spectrum Disorders. The values of illustrated society advocate
   the access to knowledge for people on equal conditions. Our own public
   and private education system is based on the merit declaring the
   equality of citizens. The main aim of our technological proposal is to
   demonstrate in the practice that the inclusion of students with visual
   impairment or autism spectrum disorders in the music room, both in
   schools and conservatories, is positively feasible through curricular
   changes and using some resources that optimize the inclusion. And in
   this process, the teacher is a fundamental key part of the educational
   inclusion. Teachers should have the tools, based on traditional and new
   technologies, which will help them facilitate and enhance and improve
   their task results. The design and operation of the interface, which
   allows the generation and combination of sounds in real time according
   to the movements made by the student, is based on an open hardware
   platform and on an open software development environment. These ensure,
   from the beginning, a cheap interface and make it available to the
   educational community a tool that could use and improve, if deemed, its
   performance according to their own needs.}},

   systems. Pervasive and Physical computing have a great demand in both
   the market and education. The need for creating interfaces that acquire
   data from users and their environment, has led to proliferation of
   interest in ubiquitous computing and more innovative solutions. In this
   paper, we describe the design and delivery of a training workshop that
   was developed for academics with Information Technology background; the
   key objective of this workshop's training, was to introduce them to
   concepts related to physical computing and spark their interest in
   broadening the scope of computing background for them and their
   students. The workshop features the Arduino UNO micro-controller since
   it is a cross platform, open source, and open hardware. Also, due to the
   fact it's low-cost, flexibility, and simplicity. The sessions covered
   topics of how to build a circuit, program an Arduino, demonstrate the
   (IC)-C-2 protocol and establish a serial communication. Twenty-two
   participants took part in the workshop sessions and two instructors were
   involved in running the sessions. Insights obtained from conducting the
   sessions and feedback from participants are synthesized and discussed.
   Implications for training related to introducing physical computing to

Abstract = {{Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) is one of the key
   components of the next generation air transportation system. Since ADS-B
   will become mandatory by 2020 for most airspaces, it is important that
   aspects such as capacity, applications, and security are investigated by
   an independent research community. However, large-scale real-world data
   was previously only accessible to a few closed industrial and
   governmental groups because it required specialized and expensive
   equipment. To enable researchers to conduct experimental studies based
   on real data, we developed OpenSky, a sensor network based on low-cost
   hardware connected over the Internet.
   OpenSky is based on off-the-shelf ADS-B sensors distributed to
   volunteers throughout Central Europe. It covers 720,000 km(2), is able
   to capture more than 30\% of the commercial air traffic in Europe, and
   enables researchers to analyze billions of ADS-B messages. In this
   paper, we report on the challenges we faced during the development and
   deployment of this participatory network and the insights we gained over
   the last two years of operations as a service to academic research
   groups. We go on to provide real-world insights about the possibilities
   and limitations of such low-cost sensor networks concerning air traffic
   surveillance and further applications such as multilateration.}},

Abstract = {{This paper details the implementation of a low-cost, open hardware,
   cloud-based intelligent farm automation system. Physical parameters such
   as soil moisture, temperature and humidity are measured by employing
   sensors sited across the monitored area. The parametric data is
   transmitted to the Atmel ATmega328P microcontroller from the sensors
   using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The cloud performs real time
   intelligence operations based on periodic sensor inputs obtained from
   the farm and transmits control commands to the microcontroller. The
   novelty of the system lies in the use of BLE and in the intelligence
   provided by the cloud. The physically monitored, as well as virtually
   obtained parameters, at the cloud level allow intelligent command
   generation, facilitated by a data exchange system that leverages the
   existing telecom network prevalent in developing countries. Based on the
   cloud commands, the ATmega328P microcontroller controls the operation
   time period of the irrigation system thus conserving both water and
   energy. The approximate cost of implementing the proof of concept system
   elaborated in this paper by using off the shelf components at retail
   price is about USD 16. It is expected that the system cost will further
   reduce on mass production and commercialization.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the long-term learning properties of an artificial neural
   network model, designed for sound recognition and computational auditory
   scene analysis in general, are investigated. The model is designed to
   run for long periods of time (weeks to months) on low-cost hardware,
   used in a noise monitoring network, and builds upon previous work by the
   same authors. It consists of three neural layers, connected to each
   other by feedforward and feedback excitatory connections. It is shown
   that the different mechanisms that drive auditory attention emerge
   naturally from the way in which neural activation and intra-layer
   inhibitory connections are implemented in the model. Training of the
   artificial neural network is done following the Hebb principle,
   dictating that ``Cells that fire together, wire together{''}, with some
   important modifications, compared to standard Hebbian learning. As the
   model is designed to be on-line for extended periods of time, also
   learning mechanisms need to be adapted to this. The learning needs to be
   strongly attention-and saliency-driven, in order not to waste available
   memory space for sounds that are of no interest to the human listener.
   The model also implements plasticity, in order to deal with new or
   changing input over time, without catastrophically forgetting what it
   already learned. On top of that, it is shown that also the
   implementation of shortterm memory plays an important role in the
   long-term learning properties of the model. The above properties are
   investigated and demonstrated by training on real urban sound
   recordings.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally, the complexities and costs associated with design
   conceptualization (e.g., 3D scanning) and design realization (e.g., 3D
   printing) have limited the diversity of individuals capable of
   participating in the process to individuals/entities with advanced
   technical backgrounds or substantial financial resources. The authors of
   this work propose a methodology that utiliies low cost hardware and open
   source software to make the capture, reuse and management of des01
   knowledge more accessible to the general public.
   3D scanners are digital tools that facilitate the conversion of physical
   object information into the digital space through multiple image capture
   techniques. 3D scanners have the potential to revolutionize design
   conceptualization in society by enabling individuals to seamlessly
   transform physical representations of objects into a digital 3D rendered
   version. The 3D rendered version can then be manipulated using existing
   3D CAD tools (e.g., Solid Works) and subsequently printed using a 3D
   printer.
   Design realization via 3D printers (e.g., RepRaps) is becoming an
   integral aspect of the engineering design process. While the
   conceptualization of designs (e.g. CAD models) helps designers visually
   experience potential candidate designs, product prototypes that can
   actually be touched and manipulated add an important feedback' dimension
   to the engineering design process. This scan-edit print approach to
   design conceptualization and realization will enable designers
   collaborating in online environments to work towards achieving a common
   design by providing them with tools and techniques.
   A case study is presented that demonstrates the feasibility of the scan
   (knowledge capture), edit (knowledge reuse) and print (knowledge
   management) approach to design using low cost hardware and open source
   software.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a low-cost open source prototype of a gesture
   recognition and interpretation glove that aids audio-vocally impaired
   individuals in communication. A sensor based glove for recognition of
   the gestures in the American Sign Language (ASL) is the input module to
   the system. It incorporates resistive flex sensors and contact sensors
   appropriately positioned to obtain a theoretical efficiency of 96\% in
   character recognition. When the sensors are subjected to change in
   orientation by the user, the variation in electrical resistance of each
   of the individual sensors is obtained as the input to an Arduino
   ATMega328 microcontroller that accurately maps it to the letters of the
   English alphabet through an efficient algorithm. An elegant methodology
   that is easy to implement using a microcontroller is employed for the
   mapping process to minimize the complexity of the system. The paper also
   presents a detailed study of the efficiency characteristics involved in
   the construction of the custom-designed flex sensors utilized in the
   system. The paper outlines the calibration and testing results of the
   sensors. The highlights of the system are its ergonomic and economical
   design, portability and intelligent gesture recognition and
   interpretation ability. The implemented system achieves a practical
   efficiency of up to 80\% of theoretical efficiency. The cost of the
   system is approximately less than USD 5 at laboratory condition using
   off the shelf components.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The democratization of invention is a long lasting desire for
   the advancement of society. Having access to education and the means of
   production appears as the major factors for the implementation of this
   goal. 3D printing is a revolutionary technology that has the potential
   to bring digital manufacturing to everyone. However, the rise of
   personal fabrication requires an increase in printing quality, a
   reduction on machine cost and an increase in knowledge shared by the
   open hardware community. The purpose of this paper is to explore the
   development of a new Open Hardware printer project to address these
   points.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors have designed and constructed
   a low-cost photopolymer-based 3D printer called BeamMaker. The printer
   is connected to a host computer and a digital-light-processing
   projector. This work details the design process and how improvements
   were implemented to reach good printing quality. The authors provide
   public access to the instructions, software, source code, parts list,
   user manual and STL and CAD files.
   Findings - The BeamMaker printer can build objects with a high surface
   quality that is comparable to the quality obtained by industrial
   photopolymer-based 3D printers. When testing the ability to print a
   sample cylinder, the printer shows higher accuracy when compared to
   other personal 3D printers. These findings are encouraging considering
   the low cost of the system.
   Research limitations/implications - The printing failure rate of the
   system has not been measured to date. The system requires some
   improvements to produce large objects.
   Practical implications - The printer cost is just USD380. This is five
   to eight times less expensive than popular personal 3D printers
   available today. The cost is 30 times less expensive than a personal
   photopolymer 3D printer produced by a main commercial company and yet
   producing results of similar quality. The authors expect good avenues
   for collaboration from the open-source community to continue improving
   these systems. Social implications - The high cost of current personal
   3D printers prevents users from developing countries from entering into
   the open hardware trend. A dramatic reduction in printer cost such as
   that explored in this work might contribute to the real democratization
   of personal fabrication.
   Originality/value - The authors report on the status of three other
   photopolymer-based personal 3D printer projects. To the best of the
   authors' knowledge, BeamMaker is the first fully open hardware 3D
   printer project which uses this technology.}},

Abstract = {{The hyper-spectrum data exhibits the structure, materials, and semantic
   meaning of a nature scene and its fast acquisition is of great
   importance due to its potential for parse these properties of dynamic
   scenes. Targeting for high speed hyper-spectrum imaging of a nature
   scene, this paper proposes to capture the coded hyper-spectrum
   reflectance of a nature scene using low cost hardware and reconstruct
   the latent data using a corresponding decoding algorithm. Except for a
   wide spectrum light source, the imaging system includes mainly a
   commercially available projector color wheel and a high speed camera,
   which work at their own constant periods and are self-synchronized by
   our algorithm. The introduced light source and color wheel cost less
   than 50 dollars and makes the proposed approach widely available. The
   results on the data captured by our prototype system show that, the
   proposed approach can reconstruct the high precision hyper-spectrum data
   at real time.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, with the innovation of modern medical technology, the elderly

   capability of mobile phone and the quality of nebvorking have been
   improved. With the proposed model, the elderly health care strategy is
   changed. To begin with, the questionnaire has been carried out to the
   caretaker of the elderly. The result shows that almost all of them would
   like to tend the elderly at home if these three major problems; falling,
   medicine taking, and monitoring, can be solved. In this paper, not only
   the senior patient can recuperate at home safely without home health
   aides but also, this new model runs with everyday technologies and
   low-cost equipment such as Smartphone. The falling is detected with an
   integrated tri-axial gyroscope and the alert will be sent to the
   caretaker via the Internet. The medicine taking problem is solved with
   the medicine box that can be controlled by the caretaker in a remote
   distance. Lastly, the monitoring application is developed.}},

Abstract = {{Since its inception in 19th-century Germany, the physiology laboratory
   has been a complex and expensive research enterprise involving experts
   in various fields of science and engineering. Physiology research has
   been critically dependent on cutting-edge technological support of
   mechanical, electrical, optical, and more recently computer engineers.
   Evolution of modern experimental equipment is constrained by lack of
   direct communication between the physiological community and industry
   producing this equipment. Fortunately, recent advances in open source
   technologies, including three-dimensional printing, open source hardware
   and software, present an exciting opportunity to bring the design and
   development of research instrumentation to the end user, i.e., life
   scientists. Here we provide an overview on how to develop customized,

Abstract = {{With the recent development of the RepRap, an open-source
   self-replicating rapid prototyper, low-cost three-dimensional (3D)
   printing is now a technically viable form of distributed manufacturing
   of polymer-based products. However, the aggregate environmental benefits
   of distributed manufacturing are not clear due to scale reductions and
   the potential for increases in embodied energy. To quantify the
   environmental impact of distributed manufacturing using 3D printers, a
   life cycle analysis was performed on three plastic products. The
   embodied energy and emissions from conventional large-scale production
   in low-labor cost countries and shipping are compared to experimental
   measurements on a RepRap with and without solar photovoltaic (PV) power
   fabricating products with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and
   polylactic acid (PLA). The results indicate that the cumulative energy
   demand of manufacturing polymer products can be reduced by 41-64\%
   (55-74\% with PV) and concomitant emission reductions using distributed
   manufacturing with existing low-cost open-source 3D printers when using
   <25\% fill PIA. Less pronounced positive environmental results are
   observed with ABS, which demands higher temperatures for the print bed
   and extruder. Overall, the results indicate that distributed
   manufacturing using open-source 3D printers has the potential to have a
   lower environmental impact than conventional manufacturing for a variety
   of products.}},

Abstract = {{The 4G of mobile networks will be a technology-opportunistic and
   user-centric system, combining the economical and technological
   advantages of various transmission technologies. As a part of its new
   architecture, LTE networks will implement an evolved packet core.
   Although this will provide various critical advantages, it will, on the
   other hand, expose telecom networks to serious IP-based attacks. One
   often adopted solution to mitigate such attacks is based on a
   centralized security architecture. However, this approach requires large
   processing and memory resources to handle huge amounts of traffic,
   which, in turn, causes a significant over dimensioning problem in the
   centralized nodes. Hence, it may cause this approach to fail from
   achieving its security task. In this paper, we focus on a SPAM flooding
   attack, namely SMTP SPAM, and demonstrate, through simulations and
   discussion, its DoS impact on the Long Term Evolution (LTE) network and
   subsequent effects on the mobile network operator. Our main contribution
   involves proposing a distributed architecture on the LTE network that is
   secure and that mitigates attacks efficiently by solving the over
   dimensioning problem. It is also cost-effective by utilizing
   off-the-shelf' low-cost hardware in the distributed nodes. Through
   additional simulation and analysis, we demonstrate the feasibility and
   effectiveness of our approach. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Print management solutions are necessary for organizations that need to
   monitor, report and charge printing or photocopying usage, especially in
   large domains where business goals require streamlined procedures.
   High-end print management systems offer integrated credit reception and
   efficient, parametrized accounting for the use of resources. The usage
   of printers and photocopy machines is controlled and monitored, and,
   through the latter, waste elimination is achieved. Print management
   inherently conforms with the rationale and mentality of green and
   eco-friendly technologies that also relate with the ethos of the open
   source movement in IT. One would expect that open source print
   management solutions would thrive; however, the vast majority of
   integrated management systems are commercial. There is only a small
   number of valuable open source print accounting solutions, but there are
   none that integrate accounting with a form of credit reception. This
   paper presents the design of an open system that integrates the
   provision of automated credit reception with accounting services in
   order to produce an open solution that fully automates the business
   process of print charging. The objective is to design the necessary
   automations for credit reception so that it can be realized without any
   human intervention, to plan the integration with a suitable open print
   accounting system and to specify any complementary utilities and tools
   necessary for production installations.}},

Abstract = {{In this contribution, a control strategy in phase coordinates abc is
   proposed as the reference current generator to be used by the shunt
   active power filter (APF) compensation device. The development of the
   proposed reference current generator is described in detail. Its control
   design is kept simple, and transformation between different frameworks
   is not needed, thus allowing the control strategy to be applicable for
   both three-phase and single-phase electric systems maintaining
   theoretical and practical advantages. The proposed control strategy for
   the reference current generator is tested using Matlab/Simulink (R) with
   the incorporation of the Real-Time Workshop (R) for the simulation of
   the shunt APF compensation in real time. Based on the reported real-time
   application, it is possible to obtain simulation conditions that are
   close to the true real-time environment under study using only a single
   computer, giving accurate results with relatively low-cost hardware and
   providing a more complete evaluation of the applied control strategy.
   The dynamic behavior and performance of the shunt APF, using the
   proposed reference current calculator, have shown remarkable results.

   community in this regard. Most of the approaches focus on single image
   features aiming at detecting differences between real and computer
   generated images. However, with the current technology advances, there
   is no universal image characterization technique that completely solves
   this problem. In our work, we (1) present a complete study of several CG
   versus PG approaches; (2) create a large and heterogeneous dataset to be
   used as a training and validation database; (3) implement representative
   methods of the literature; and (4) devise automatic ways for combining
   the best approaches. We compared the implemented methods using the same
   validation environment showing their pros and cons with a common
   benchmark protocol. We collected approximately 4850 photographs and 4850
   CGs with large diversity of image content and quality. We implemented a
   total of 13 methods. Results show that this set of methods can achieve
   up to 93\% of accuracy when used without any form of machine learning
   fusion. The same methods, when combined through the implemented fusion
   schemes, can achieve an accuracy rate of 97\%, representing a reduction
   of 57\% of the classification error over the best individual result. (C)

Abstract = {{With the source and detector kept stationary while an inspected object
   moves between them, straight-line-trajectory-based tomographic imaging
   (SLTTI) has the capability to provide both digital radiologic images and
   tomographic images simultaneously, at high speed and with low-cost
   equipment. It has a promising future for fast security inspection for
   air cargo examinations. In order to fully investigate the feasibility of
   this approach, an experimental SLTTI platform has been developed. In
   this work, the system design is first presented. Then, a hybrid image
   reconstruction algorithm is proposed to obtain high quality tomographic
   images from the system to solve the limited-angle problem it represents.
   In the proposed algorithm, an initial reconstruction using either a
   direct filtered-backprojection (FBP)-type algorithm or the linogram
   technique is followed by a Gerchberg-Papoulis (GP) extrapolation to
   compensate for missing data. The GP extrapolation is implemented by the
   linogram technique, and constrained by a total variation (TV)
   minimization. By taking advantage of the FBP, the linogram and the TV
   techniques, we establish a fast and stable iterative reconstruction for
   the SLTTI. Finally, numerical simulations and realistic experiments are
   given, through which our proposals are validated to be feasible and
   effective. In the numerical examples, our algorithm can reduce the
   reconstruction inaccuracies for both high contrast and low contrast
   objects by factors of more than 15 and can generate nearly artifact free
   images as if complete projection data were available. A realistic
   experiment on a CatPhan (c) 600 phantom suggests that high quality
   tomographic images can be achieved from 120-deg of source fan-beam angle
   with undersampled data. For a group of explosive simulacra using 90
   projection views over 120-deg of source fan-beam angle, the
   reconstruction inaccuracy can be reduced to lower than 4\%.}},

   maximum-likelihood denoising for real-time applications}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC IMAGING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Computationally scalable image interpolation algorithm is always
   desirable for software and hardware implementations on center processing
   unit (CPU), digital signal processor, field-programmable gate array, and
   low-cost hardware. A low-complexity, computationally scalable, and
   data-adaptive image interpolation algorithm that has a simple and
   homogeneous structure to efficiently scale the computation is proposed.
   Specifically, the image interpolation as a denoising problem is
   formulated by proposing a new image model to relate the observed
   low-resolution pixels and missing high-resolution pixels. Applying the
   maximum-likelihood estimation using the new image model results in an
   adaptive linear filter, where the filter coefficients depend on the
   local noise covariance matrix, which is estimated by local noise
   samples. Due to low overhead of the proposed interpolator, the overall
   computation efficiently scales with the number of noise samples.
   Experimental results show that the proposed scalable algorithm
   outperforms the state-of-the-art fast algorithms and achieves more than
   36 frames per second for upscaling a 540 p (960 x 540) video to a 1080 p
   (1920 x 1080) video using multithreaded C++ software implementation on a

   lifetime of 10 years. Due to major modifications ASDEX Upgrade is still
   in operation. Infrastructure like data acquisition, workstations, etc.
   is being modernized, interfaces like RS-232 are vanishing and new
   interfaces are being introduced. This leads to the necessity to adapt
   old hardware. Most of the microcontrollers used in the old hardware do
   not offer any support of the new interfaces and have to be replaced. A
   simple and efficient way is to replace them with open hardware
   microcontroller boards like the Arduino. These boards are based on 8-bit
   RISC microcontrollers and offer a software development environment with
   a large number of libraries. In this paper the use of Arduino boards for
   replacing the position unit, the stub tuner interface and its use
   controlling a direct digital synthesizer (DDS) with phase control

   within plausible reconstructions of brain connectivity. We demonstrate
   that scale-free network topology only emerges when adequately fine

Abstract = {{The combination of OFDM with joint preprocessing in adaptive
   multi-antenna systems offers both an ease of equalization in
   frequency-selective channels and keeping the signal processing at the
   mobile stations simple. In addition, the spatial dimension can be
   efficiently exploited to ensure high system throughput. With the
   utilization of higher-order modulation the performance of the system is
   highly sensitive to multiple access interference and nonorthogonal
   subchannels due to hardware impairments or insufficient adaptation to
   the current channel conditions. A further source of error in TDD systems
   are the non-reciprocal transceivers inhibiting the baseband-to-baseband
   channel reciprocity required for accurate channel state acquisition
   based on the uplink channel estimate. In this paper, measurement results
   of a low-cost hardware-based calibration are presented and the drawbacks
   are discussed leading to the utilization of a recently introduced
   relative calibration. The latter is applied to an OFDM system and
   achieves or at least approximates the baseband-to-baseband reciprocity.
   Thus, it enables the link adaptation using the uplink channel state
   information. Furthermore, preliminary hardware implementations of the
   relative calibration running on a real-time system show accurate
   results.}},

Abstract = {{The integration of nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into
   microsystems is highly desirable, in order to make use of the unique
   nanomaterial properties in real devices. However, the CNT-to-microsystem
   integration is challenging to implement in a manufacturable,

   process for making complete, integrated CMOS / MEMS systems with
   integrated CNT. We demonstrate the feasibility of the process, using
   room-temperature processing, low-cost equipment and consumables, and
   electrical control with automation possibilities. CNTs are directly
   integrated at the desired positions in the Si microsystem, forming
   closed Si / CNT / Si circuits. We explore different designs with the aim
   to obtain uniform and well-defined CNT synthesis conditions, and show
   that simplified designs can perform comparably to more complex ones. The
   Si / CNT / Si circuits obtained can show rectifying (Schottkylike) or
   near-ohmic behavior. Gas sensing possibilities are demonstrated,
   indicating the possibility of monitoring aging/fermenting of food.
   Functionalization of CNTs is demonstrated, using thermal evaporation of
   Sn and Pd, opening for selective and sensitive sensors for various gases
   and analytes. Detailed microscopic characterization of the obtained CNTs
   are presented.}},

Abstract = {{The recent development of open-source 3-D printers makes scaling of
   distributed additive-based manufacturing of high-value objects
   technically feasible and offers the potential for widespread
   proliferation of mechatronics education and participation. These
   self-replicating rapid prototypers (RepRaps) can manufacture
   approximately half of their own parts from sequential fused deposition
   of polymer feedstocks. RepRaps have been demonstrated for conventional
   prototyping and engineering, customizing scientific equipment, and
   appropriate technology-related manufacturing for sustainable
   development. However, in order for this technology to proliferate like
   2-D electronic printers have, it must be economically viable for a
   typical household. This study reports on the life-cycle economic
   analysis (LCEA) of RepRap technology for an average US household. A new
   low-cost RepRap is described and the costs of materials and time to
   construct it are quantified. The economic costs of a selection of 20
   open-source printable designs (representing less than 0.02\% of those
   available), are typical of products that a household might purchase, are
   quantified for print time, energy, and filament consumption and compared
   to low and high Internet market prices for similar products without
   shipping costs. The results show that even making the extremely
   conservative assumption that the household would only use the printer to
   make the selected 20 products a year the avoided purchase cost savings
   would range from about \$300 to \$2000/year. Assuming the 25 h of
   necessary printing for the selected products is evenly distributed
   throughout the year these savings provide a simple payback time for the
   RepRap in 4 months to 2 years and provide an ROI between >200\% and
   >40\%. As both upgrades and the components that are most likely to wear
   out in the RepRap can be printed and thus the lifetime of the
   distributing manufacturing can be substantially increased the
   unavoidable conclusion from this study is that the RepRap is an
   economically attractive investment for the average US household already.
   It appears clear that as RepRaps improve in reliability, continue to
   decline in cost and both the number and assumed utility of open-source
   designs continues growing exponentially, open-source 3-D printers will
   become a mass-market mechatronic device. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},

Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{The rapid detection and identification of infectious disease pathogens
   is a critical need for healthcare in both developed and developing
   countries. As we gain more insight into the genomic basis of pathogen
   infectivity and drug resistance, point-of-care nucleic acid testing will
   likely become an important tool for global health. In this paper, we
   present an inexpensive, handheld, battery-powered instrument designed to
   enable pathogen genotyping in the developing world. Our Microfluidic
   Biomolecular Amplification Reader (mBAR) represents the convergence of
   molecular biology, microfluidics, optics, and electronics technology.
   The mBAR is capable of carrying out isothermal nucleic acid
   amplification assays with real-time fluorescence readout at a fraction
   of the cost of conventional benchtop thermocyclers. Additionally, the
   mBAR features cell phone data connectivity and GPS sample geotagging
   which can enable epidemiological surveying and remote healthcare
   delivery. The mBAR controls assay temperature through an integrated
   resistive heater and monitors real-time fluorescence signals from 60
   individual reaction chambers using LEDs and phototransistors. Assays are
   carried out on PDMS disposable microfluidic cartridges which require no
   external power for sample loading. We characterize the fluorescence
   detection limits, heater uniformity, and battery life of the instrument.
   As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrate the detection of the HIV-1
   integrase gene with the mBAR using the Loop-Mediated Isothermal
   Amplification (LAMP) assay. Although we focus on the detection of
   purified DNA here, LAMP has previously been demonstrated with a range of
   clinical samples, and our eventual goal is to develop a microfluidic
   device which includes on-chip sample preparation from raw samples. The
   mBAR is based entirely around open source hardware and software, and in
   the accompanying online supplement we present a full set of schematics,
   bill of materials, PCB layouts, CAD drawings, and source code for the
   mBAR instrument with the goal of spurring further innovation toward
   low-cost genetic diagnostics.}},

Abstract = {{Approximately 10\%-20\% of adults and adolescents suffer from irritable
   bowel syndrome (IBS) worldwide. IBS is characterized by chronic
   gastrointestinal dysfunction which may reflect in altered motility.
   Currently, the diagnosis of IBS is made through expensive invasive
   radiographic and endoscopic examinations. However these are inconvenient
   and unsuited for community screening. Bowel sounds (BSs) can be easily
   recorded with non-invasive and low-cost equipment. Recently, several
   researchers have pointed out changes in features obtained from BS
   according to the pathological condition of bowel motility. However a
   widely accepted, simple automatic BS detection algorithm still has to be
   found, and the appropriate recording period needs to be investigated for
   further evaluation of bowel motility. In this study we propose a novel
   simple automatic method to detect the BSs based on the 3 dB bandwidth of
   the frequency peaks in the autoregressive moving average spectrum. We
   use the measure, sound-to-sound interval (SSI) obtained by the proposed
   method, to capture bowel motility. In this paper, we show that the
   proposed method for automatic detection could achieve a sensitivity of
   87.8 +/- 5.88\%, specificity of 91.7 +/- 4.33\% and area under the curve
   of 0.923 when working on 16 healthy volunteers during mosapride
   administrations. Furthermore, we show that the measured SSI averaged
   over a period of 30 min can clearly capture bowel motility. Our findings
   should have the potential to contribute toward developing automated
   BS-based diagnosis of IBS.}},

Volume = {{62}},

Abstract = {{The need of large-scale monitoring of power quality (PQ) in electrical
   power systems require the design of reliable and cost-effective
   measurement instruments. In this framework, Field Programmable Gate
   Array (FPGA) architectures seem to offer valid solutions since they
   allow powerful measurement algorithms to be implemented on low-cost
   hardware with reconfigurable firmware. This paper proposes a FPGA-based
   measurement instrument for harmonic and interharmonic monitoring in
   compliance with the most important PQ standards. Key feature of the
   proposed instrument is the very low requirements of hardware and
   firmware FPGA resources, thus making it suitable for applications that
   require cost-effective measurements. The proposed instrument shows
   performance comparable with one of the powerful and more expensive
   measurement solutions available on the market. In particular, despite
   the absence of a sampling frequency synchronization system, the proposed
   instrument proves to be compliant with IEC 61000-4-30, even in the
   presence of huge frequency deviations. After a description of the
   proposed hardware and firmware solutions, the experimental
   characterization of the proposed instrument in emulated and real
   environments is reported.}},

   It is primarily designed to study the dynamics of the upper atmosphere

   CAPRI is constructed using the open source software-defined radio
   toolkit, GNU Radio, to meet the signal processing requirements in
   combination with the open source hardware, Universal Software Radio
   Peripheral 2, for data acquisition. The resultant system is highly
   flexible, and we present the details of the design as well as a
   performance analysis. CAPRI will be deployed in Peru, near the magnetic
   equator, for long-term operations in the area. FM stations near Lima,
   Peru, will be utilized with the targets of interest being the equatorial
   electrojet and the spread F. The results will then be compared to the

Abstract = {{ManyEars is an open framework for microphone array-based audio
   processing. It consists of a sound source localization, tracking and
   separation system that can provide an enhanced speaker signal for
   improved speech and sound recognition in real-world settings. ManyEars
   software framework is composed of a portable and modular C library,
   along with a graphical user interface for tuning the parameters and for
   real-time monitoring. This paper presents the integration of the
   ManyEars Library with Willow Garage's Robot Operating System. To
   facilitate the use of ManyEars on various robotic platforms, the paper
   also introduces the customized microphone board and sound card
   distributed as an open hardware solution for implementation of robotic
   audition systems.}},

Abstract = {{For many years robotics has been benefited from the open source
   community. Software community projects like Player, Stage, Gazebo, ROS,
   or OpenCV are present in most robotic applications. In recent years this
   trend has also been initiated among electronic and mechanical
   developments (open hardware). The Arduino development platform is a good
   example of a successful hardware project with a great community of
   developers and users around it. The apparition of personal 3D printers
   is bringing the open source philosophy to the fabrication of physical
   things as well. This new technology is in need of new designing tools to
   take advantage of it. In this paper we are presenting the C++ Object
   Oriented Mechanics Library (OOML), a tool to design mechanical
   components, taking into account the needs and requirements of these
   emerging technologies. These designs can be easily shared, reused, and
   modified. The OOML brings together the advantages of (1) modelling
   things through code, (2) the object oriented programming paradigm, and
   (3) the power of C++. In the OOML, mechanical parts are described as
   geometrical combinations of basic primitives. Once a part is defined,
   fabrication files can be generated in order to print, or mechanize it.
   Models could also be used for simulation, visualization, structural
   analysis, etc.}},

Abstract = {{OpenPMU is an open platform for the development of phasor measurement
   unit (PMU) technology. A need has been identified for an open-source
   alternative to commercial PMU devices tailored to the needs of the
   university researcher and for enabling the development of new
   synchrophasor instruments from this foundation. OpenPMU achieves this
   through open-source hardware design specifications and software source
   code, allowing duplicates of the OpenPMU to be fabricated under
   open-source licenses. This paper presents the OpenPMU device based on
   the Labview development environment. The device is performance tested
   according to the IEEE C37.118.1 standard. Compatibility with the IEEE
   C37.118.2 messaging format is achieved through middleware which is
   readily adaptable to other PMU projects or applications. Improvements
   have been made to the original design to increase its flexibility. A new
   modularized architecture for the OpenPMU is presented using an open
   messaging format which the authors propose is adopted as a platform for
   PMU research.}},

Abstract = {{The high cost of what have historically been sophisticated
   research-related sensors and tools has limited their adoption to a
   relatively small group of well-funded researchers. This paper provides a
   methodology for applying an open-source approach to design and
   development of a colorimeter. A 3-D printable, open-source colorimeter
   utilizing only open-source hardware and software solutions and readily
   available discrete components is discussed and its performance compared
   to a commercial portable colorimeter. Performance is evaluated with
   commercial vials prepared for the closed reflux chemical oxygen demand
   (COD) method. This approach reduced the cost of reliable closed reflux
   COD by two orders of magnitude making it an economic alternative for the
   vast majority of potential users. The open-source colorimeter
   demonstrated good reproducibility and serves as a platform for further
   development and derivation of the design for other, similar purposes
   such as nephelometry. This approach promises unprecedented access to
   sophisticated instrumentation based on low-cost sensors by those most in
   need of it, under-developed and developing world laboratories.}},

Abstract = {{Just as the power of the open-source design paradigm has driven down the
   cost of software to the point that it is accessible to most People, the
   rise of open-source hardware is Poised to drive down the cost of doing
   experimental science to expand access to everyone. To assist in this
   aim, this paper introduces a library of open-source 3-D-printable optics
   components. This library operates as a flexible, low-cost public-domain
   tool set for developing both research and teaching optics hardware.
   First, the use of parametric open-source designs using an open-source
   computer aided design package is described to customize the optics
   hardware for any application. Second, details are provided on the use of
   open-source 3 D printers (additive layer manufacturing) to fabricate the
   primary mechanical components, which are then combined to construct
   complex optics-related devices. Third, the use of the open-source
   electronics prototyping platform are illustrated as control for optical
   experimental apparatuses. This study demonstrates an open-source optical
   library, which significantly reduces the costs associated with much
   optical equipment, while also enabling relatively easily adapted
   customizable designs. The cost reductions in general are over 97\%, with
   some components representing only 1\% of the current commercial
   investment for optical products of similar function. The results of this
   study make its clear that this method of scientific hardware development
   enables a much broader audience to participate in optical
   experimentation both as research and teaching platforms than previous
   proprietary methods.}},

Abstract = {{Argentina is an important worldwide wine producer. In this country,
   there are several recognizable provinces that produce Sauvignon blanc

   as principal component analysis (PCA), cluster analysis (CA), linear
   discriminant analysis (LDA), and partial least square discriminant
   analysis (PLS-DA). The proposed method requires low-cost equipment and
   short-time analysis in comparison with other techniques. The results are
   in very good agreement with results based on the geographical origin of

Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{23-34}},

Abstract = {{The FireFader is a simple haptic force-feedback device that is optimized
   for introducing musicians to haptics. It is based upon a
   single-degree-of-freedom potentiometer fader coupled to a DC motor, also
   known as a ``motorized fader.{''} A light is connected in parallel with
   the motor to help communicate the force's strength visually. The
   FireFader consists of only open-source hardware and open-source software
   elements. Consequently, it is relatively easy for users to repurpose it
   into new projects involving varying kinds and numbers of motors and
   sensors.
   An open-source device driver for the FireFader allows it to be linked to
   a computer via USB so that the computer can perform the feedback control
   calculations. For example, the computer can simulate the acoustics of a
   virtual musical instrument to concurrently synthesize sound and
   calculate the motor force as a function of the fader position. The
   serial connection over USB increases the latency of the control signal
   compared to embedded implementations, but the serial connection
   facilitates easier programming via the computer, and the force feedback
   can be automatically disabled when the user is not touching the fader.
   Some new devices derived from the FireFader design are presented.}},

Abstract = {{THE LIFE CYCLE OF A RADIOSONDE The development of scientific instruments
   Was, only a few years ago, confined to universities and electronics
   companies having highly specialized human and/or technical resources.
   With the advent of open hardware initiatives, engineers, scientists,
   hobbyists, and even people with limited electronic skills have been able
   to tinker with complex electronic systems. Taking advantage of these
   inexpensive and widely available tools and in the context of an
   engineering project class for undergraduates, the authors set about
   building a working radiosonde prototype from the ground up, based on an
   open hardware platform and easily accessible components.
   As a result, a fully functional radiosonde has been built that measures,
   records, and transmits pressure, temperature, humidity, and wind, plus a
   small camera that stores images on a flash card. A release system was
   also developed so that the radiosonde can be detached from a balloon
   upon reaching a certain height, pressure level, or flight time. Once it
   is released., one can attempt the recovery of the radiosonde with the
   help of a precalculated trajectory using a numerical mesoscale
   forecasting model and visualization software. The performance of the
   sonde Was compared with two commercial radiosondes using climate
   chambers and two field launches. This paper also discusses some of the
   more interesting capabilities foreseeable for such a platform: 1)
   collaboration between meteorology and engineering departments in both
   education and research, and 2) development of a flexible hardware
   platform that allows for an effective way to compare different
   commercially available sensors and to easily integrate new prototype
   sensors. (Page 187)}},

Abstract = {{Uranium deposits were recovered at the solid cathode of an
   electrorefining system, and deposited uranium dendrite normally contains
   about 30-40 wt\% LiCl-KCl eutectic salts. Therefore, a separation of the
   eutectic salts from deposited uranium is essential for reusing these
   salts and uranium. A process such as distillation was employed for
   cathode processing due to the advantages of a minimal generation of
   secondary waste, a compact unit process, and simple and low-cost
   equipment. However, the realization of a wide evaporation area or high
   distillation temperature is limited by various factors such as the
   material or structure of a distiller. Also, the electrical energy flow
   from outside has a lot of consumption to maintain the high temperature.
   Hence, in this study, solid-liquid separation experiments are proposed
   to increase the throughput of the salt removal process by the separation
   of the liquid salt prior to the distillation of the LiCl-KCl eutectic
   salt. The solid-liquid separation of salt was carried out in a vertical
   type distiller. The behavior of the solid-liquid separation of pure
   eutectic salt was investigated as a function of temperature, pressure,
   sieve size, and crucible shape. From the experimental results using pure
   eutectic salts, the amount of salt separation was achieved at more than
   94 wt\%. The rate of solid-liquid separation of salt using 600 A degrees
   C is higher than that of 500 A degrees C under the same condition. The
   influence of a vacuum for solid-liquid separation can be disregarded,
   and the separation rate of a 100 mesh was higher than that of a 150
   mesh. In addition, the rate of separation for salts using a porous
   crucible is higher than that in a non-porous crucible.}},

Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{24-28}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background: Stroke affects approximately 800,000 individuals each year,
   with 65\% having residual impairments. Studies have demonstrated that
   mass practice leads to regaining motor function in affected extremities;
   however, traditional therapy does not include the repetitions needed for
   this recovery. Videogames have been shown to be good motivators to
   complete repetitions. Advances in technology and low-cost hardware bring
   new opportunities to use computer games during stroke therapy. This
   study examined the use of the Microsoft (Redmond, WA) Kinect (TM) and
   Flexible Action and Articulated Skeleton Toolkit (FAAST) software as a
   therapy tool to play existing free computer games on the Internet.
   Subjects and Methods: Three participants attended a 1-hour session where
   they played two games with upper extremity movements as game controls.
   Video was taken for analysis of movement repetitions, and questions were
   answered about participant history and their perceptions of the games.
   Results: Participants remained engaged through both games; regardless of
   previous computer use all participants successfully played two games.
   Five minutes of game play averaged 34 repetitions of the affected
   extremity. The Intrinsic Motivation Inventory showed a high level of
   satisfaction in two of the three participants.
   Conclusions: The Kinect Sensor with the FAAST software has the potential
   to be an economical tool to be used alongside traditional therapy to
   increase the number of repetitions completed in a motivating and
   engaging way for clients.}},

Abstract = {{The availability of low-cost hardware coupled with the advancement of
   VLSI technology has promoted the development of wireless multimedia
   sensor network (WMSN). However, the strict constraints in terms of
   processing power, storage, bandwidth etc. pose a great challenge to data
   processing in WMSN. In this paper we propose an energy-saving audio data
   compression technique for WMSN combining wavelet lifting with a newly
   proposed difference detection technique for an application domain where
   data are correlated and placed in a 2D grid. In addition to capturing
   spatial correlation by wavelet, this scheme captures temporal
   correlation by introducing the difference detection round. A routing
   scheme is also proposed with a target to reduce energy consumption
   further. Performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated through
   analysis on design and simulation results. While analysis on design
   establishes design feasibility, simulation results evaluate efficacy of
   the scheme in terms of two conflicting parameters viz. energy
   consumption and SNR. Finally the comparative results confirm our
   scheme's supremacy over the competing scheme in both respects.}},

   optical based weight measurement. As an additional feature, it measures
   the severity of loss of sensation in the foot through a Vibro-tactile

Abstract = {{In the search for new paradigms to simplify multithreaded programming,
   Transactional Memory (TM) is currently being advocated as a promising
   alternative to lock-based synchronization. Among the two most important
   alternatives proposed for conflict detection and data versioning in
   today's Hardware Transactional Memory systems (HTMs), the Lazy-Lazy one
   allows increased concurrency, potentially bringing higher performance
   levels in most cases. Unfortunately, the implementation of the commit
   protocol in Lazy-Lazy systems results in increased complexity and has
   severe impact on performance and energy consumption. In this work, we
   propose GCommit, an efficient and low cost hardware implementation of
   the SEQ commit protocol based on the use of hardware locks.
   Specifically, GCommit deploys hardware locks to ensure exclusive access
   to shared data at commit time. Implementing this functionality using
   dedicated hardware brings important benefits in terms of execution time
   as well as energy consumption with respect to traditional commit
   protocols that use the general-purpose interconnection network.
   Additionally, our proposal has negligible requirements in terms of area.
   Results for a 16-core CMP show that the GCommit protocol obtains average
   reductions of 15.7\% and 13.7\% in terms of execution time and energy
   consumption, respectively, compared with a traditional implementation of
   Scalable TCC with SEQ, a high-performance commit protocol proposed in
   the literature.}},

Abstract = {{The classical way of authentication with a username-password pair is
   often insufficient: an adversary can choose from a multitude of methods
   to obtain the credentials, e.g., by guessing passwords using a
   dictionary, by eavesdropping on network traffic, or by installing
   malware on the system of the target user. To overcome this problem,
   numerous solutions incorporating a second factor in the authentication
   process have been proposed. A particularly wide-spread approach provides
   each user with a hardware token that generates a One-Time Password (OTP)
   in addition to the traditional credentials. The token itself comprises a
   secret cryptographic key that, together with timestamps and counters, is
   used to derive a fresh OTP for each authentication. A relatively new yet
   widespread example for an OTP token is the Yubikey 2 produced by Yubico.
   This device employs an open-source protocol based on the mathematically
   secure AES and emulates a USB keyboard to enter the OTP in a
   platform-independent manner. In this paper, we analyse the
   susceptibility of the Yubikey 2 to side-channel attacks. We show that by
   non-invasively measuring the power consumption and the electro-magnetic
   emanation of the device, an adversary is able to extract the full
   128-bit AES key with approximately one hour of access to the Yubikey 2.
   The attack leaves no physical traces on the device and can be performed
   using low-cost equipment. In consequence, an adversary is able to
   generate valid OTPs, even after the Yubikey 2 has been returned to the
   owner.}},

Abstract = {{This article focuses on the localization and navigation of a mobile
   differential robot in an indoor office-like environment. These are
   fundamental issues to service robotics, which is a branch with a strong
   market growth. The work implements a vision tracking system, environment
   mapping, route planning and navigation for an autonomous robot
   application inside services buildings. One goal of the methodology is
   its application with low cost equipment. The test bed chosen was a
   Pioneer P3-DX robot {[}16] in a service building, with an attached USB
   webcam, pointed at the ceiling to take advantage of the position of the
   light fixtures as natural landmarks. The robot location is estimated
   through two distinct probabilistic methods: a particle filter, when
   there is no information about the starting location of the robot, and
   the Kalman filter, given the convergence of the particle filter. Both
   methods use the detection of light fixtures together with the robot
   kinematics as information to estimate the pose. The mapping of the
   environment and its obstacles is obtained from the localization
   estimates and the information gathered by ultrasound sensors,
   representing the entire navigation space discretized in the form of an
   occupation grid. Planning the navigation path is determined by a simple
   search algorithm, namely the Wavefront algorithm, based on the
   information contained in the occupancy grid. For a given path,
   navigation is performed with obstacle avoidance using the virtual forces
   method. Replanning is used to recover from local minima situations.}},

Abstract = {{Time synchronization in wireless sensor networks is important for event
   ordering and efficient communication scheduling. In this paper, we
   introduce an external hardware-based clock tuning circuit that can be
   used to improve synchronization and significantly reduce clock drift
   over long periods of time without waking up the host MCU. This is
   accomplished through two main hardware sub-systems. First, we improve
   upon the circuit presented in {[}1] that synchronizes clocks using the
   ambient magnetic fields emitted from power lines. The new circuit uses
   an electric field front-end as opposed to the original magnetic-field
   sensor, which makes the design more compact, lower-power, lower-cost,
   exhibit less jitter and improves robustness to noise generated by nearby
   appliances. Second, we present a low-cost hardware tuning circuit that
   can be used to continuously trim a micro-controller's low-power clock at
   runtime. Most time synchronization approaches require a CPU to
   periodically adjust internal counters to accommodate for clock drift.
   Periodic discrete updates can introduce interpolation errors as compared
   to continuous update approaches and they require the CPU to expend
   energy during these wake up periods. Our hardware-based external clock
   tuning circuit allows the main CPU to remain in a deep-sleep mode for
   extended periods while an external circuit compensates for clock drift.
   We show that our new synchronization circuit consumes 60\% less power
   than the original design and is able to correct clock drift rates to
   within 0.01 ppm without power hungry and expensive precision clocks.}},

Abstract = {{Since its introduction in 1992, Global System for Mobile Communications
   (GSM) has evolved to become a worldwide standard in mobile telephony.
   Security in GSM, albeit being one of the most important issues, has not
   yet been scrutinized to a level it deserves owing mainly to the
   expensive hardware requirements and lack of thorough understanding of
   GSM protocols in general. This scenario is changing significantly with
   the growing rate of development of open-source tools, which can serve to
   harness the RF signaling and enable processing on a general purpose
   workstation. In this paper, these open-source tools are utilized to
   study the feasibility of developing a GSM Protocol Analyzer and
   investigating the theoretical security protocols and procedures through
   practical implementation of such system. Universal Software Programmable
   Radio Peripheral (USRP) was selected as the RF frontend for the protocol
   analyzer. The USRP is a general purpose, open-hardware transceiver that
   can be linked to a workstation via an RJ45 Gigabit Ethernet link.
   Various open-source software, based primarily on GNU Radio, are then
   utilized to synchronize, demodulate and decode the received signal.}},

Abstract = {{An increasing number of applications require 3D content. However, its
   creation from real-world data either necessitates expensive equipment,
   artistic skills, or is constrained, for example, by the range of the
   utilized sensors. Image-based modeling is rapidly increasing in
   popularity since cameras are very affordable, widely available, and have
   a wide image acquisition range suitable for objects of vastly different
   size. The technique is especially suitable for mobile robotics involving
   low cost equipment and robots with a light payload, for example, small
   UAVs. In this paper we describe a novel image-based modeling system,
   which produces high-quality 3D content automatically from a collection
   of unconstrained and uncalibrated 2D images. The system estimates camera
   parameters and a 3D scene geometry using Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and
   Bundle Adjustment techniques. The point cloud density of 3D scene
   components is enhanced by exploiting silhouette information of the
   scene. This hybrid approach dramatically improves the reconstruction of
   objects with few visual features, for example, unicolored objects, and
   improves surface smoothness. A high quality texture is created by
   parameterizing the reconstructed objects using a segmentation and
   charting approach which also works for objects which are not
   homeomorphic to a sphere. The resulting parameter space contains one
   chart for each surface segment. A texture map is created by back
   projecting the best fitting input images onto each surface segment, and
   smoothly fusing them together over the corresponding chart by using
   graph-cut techniques.}},

Abstract = {{With the growing need of the high quality image captured by the camera
   in smartphones and other portable equipment, it is necessary to
   implement the demosaicking algorithm hardcore into the embedded system
   to balance the tradeoff between the power and performance. However,
   current demosaicking algorithms either produce poor image quality due to
   their focus on low cost hardware, or are too complex to be implemented
   into the embedded system. In this paper, we propose a cost effective
   demosaicking algorithm based on edge-orientation map and realize the
   algorithm in hardware. The proposed algorithm can reduce great hardware
   cost by adjusting the interpolation flow and simplifying the topology of
   edge-orientation map. The algorithm has been verified to be high
   performance by subjective measurement and color peak signal to noise
   ratio (CPSNR) and has been implemented in Altera FPGA with greatly
   reduced resources and a real time speed of 200MHz.}},

Abstract = {{Stationary CCTV cameras are often used to help monitor car movements and
   detect any anomalies-e.g., accidents, cars going faster than the allowed
   speed, driving under the influence of alcohol, etc. The height of the
   cameras can limit their effectiveness and the types of image processing
   algorithm which can be used. With advancements in the development of
   inexpensive aerial flying objects and wireless devices, these two
   technologies can be coupled to support enhanced surveillance. The flying
   objects can carry multiple cameras and be sent well above the ground to
   capture and feed video/image information back to a ground station. In
   addition, because of the height the objects can achieve, they can
   capture videos and images which could lend themselves more suitably for
   the application of a variety of video and image processing algorithms to
   assist analysts in detecting any anomalies. In this paper, we examine
   some main challenges of using flying objects for surveillance purposes
   and propose some potential solutions to these challenges. By doing so,
   we attempt to provide the basis for developing a framework to build a
   viable system for improved surveillance based on low-cost equipment.}},

Abstract = {{Statistical simulation based design error debug approaches strongly rely
   on quality of the diagnostic test. At the same time there exists no
   dedicated technique to perform its quality assessment and engineers are
   forced to rely on subjective figures such as verification test quality
   metrics or just the size of the diagnostic test. This paper has proposed
   two new approaches for assessing diagnostic capability of diagnostic
   tests for automated bug localization. The first approach relies on
   probabilistic simulation of diagnostic experiments. The second
   assessment method is based on calculating Hamming distances of the
   individual sub-tests in the diagnostic test set. The methods are
   computationally cheap and they provide for a measure of confidence in
   the localization results and allow estimating impact of the diagnostic
   test enhancement. The approach is implemented as a part of an
   open-source hardware design and debugging framework zamiaCAD.
   Experimental results with an industrial processor design and a set of
   documented bugs demonstrate feasibility and effectiveness of the
   proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Data replication increases data availability in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks
   (MANETs). Preventing data loss and increasing data availability in
   MANETs is a nontrivial problem due to their low-cost hardware, harsh
   working environments, node mobility, failure of mobile devices from
   battery exhaustion and node compromise attacks. In addition, different
   routing algorithms and larger size of the network can cause
   communication links to fail creating several disjoint partitions which
   causes data loss. The typical fault-tolerant systems would fail in these
   conditions. Existing approaches fail due to the limitations caused by
   their dependence on lower node mobility or constrained by node
   distribution, unpredictable partitions and routing mechanisms. In this
   paper, we propose Combinatorial Replication and Partition (CORP) of data
   which is a combinatorial arrangement with pairwise balanced design
   property to prevent data loss and increase data availability. Our scheme
   provides low access latency and reduces communication overhead. By
   partitioning and replicating data in such a combinatorial arrangement,
   our scheme directly supports object-oriented constructs in distributed
   fault-tolerant networks.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the design and installation of a spectrometer system for
   monitoring solar radiation in Cochabamba, Bolivia. Both the light
   intensity and the spectral distribution affect the power produced by a
   photovoltaic device. Local variations in the solar spectrum (especially
   compared to the AM1.5 standard) may have important implications for
   device optimization and energy yield estimation.
   The spectrometer system, based on an Ocean Optics USB4000 (300-900nm)
   spectrometer, was designed to increase functionality. Typically systems
   only record the global horizontal radiation. Our system moves a
   fiber-optic cable 0-90 degrees and takes measurements in 9 degree
   increments. Additionally, a shadow band allows measurement of the
   diffuse component of the radiation at each position. The electronic
   controls utilize an Arduino UNO microcontroller to synchronizes the
   movement of two PAP bipolar (stepper) motors with the activation of the
   spectrometer via an external trigger. The spectrometer was factory
   calibrated for wavelength and calibrated for absolute irradiance using a
   Sellarnet SL 1-Cal light source.
   We present preliminary results from data taken March-June, 2013, and
   comment on implications for PV devices in Cochabamba.}},

Abstract = {{We present new solutions based on Virtual Reality technologies for
   improving the delivery of physical therapy and rehabilitation. Three
   main aspects are addressed: 1) the ability to allow therapists to create
   new exercises and therapy programs intuitively by direct demonstration,
   2) automatic therapy delivery and monitoring with the use of an
   autonomous virtual tutor that can monitor and quantitatively assess the
   motions performed by the patient, and 3) networked collaborative remote
   therapy sessions via connected applications displaying the motions of
   both the therapist and the patient.
   We also provide 3D assessment tools for monitoring changes in the range
   of motion, and for allowing the visualization of a number of properties
   during or after the execution of exercises. The presented system has
   been implemented for a low-cost hardware solution based on Kinect and
   for a high-end immersive virtual reality facility.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a hardware platform aimed at the recently defined
   White Space Radio spectrum, but, furthermore, to describe how this
   hardware can also form the basis of a commensal radar system using the
   emissions of the Whitespace communication system. We envisage White
   Space communication systems being established in sparsely populated
   areas to provide communications. This communication network of nodes can
   be used as nodes of a multistatic network of Radars to track moving
   targets (especially aerial). The radar system is commensal in that it
   has no impact on the design and operation of the communications system.
   The choice of Whitespace spectrum has many advantages. First of all, it
   will give access to a wide bandwidth, which in turn means better
   resolution for the commensal radar system. Secondly, the standardization
   process for Whitespace communication is over. And lastly, this will be a
   communication system of choice for sparsely populated areas, which are
   also sites suitable for Radar surveillance. The UHF frequencies of White
   Space Radio have excellent propagation properties, including foliage
   penetration. Our development of hardware is because of a dearth of low
   cost hardware platforms, which are specifically tailored for such a
   purpose. The proposed platform, named White RHINO (Whitespace
   Reconfigurable Hardware Interface for ComputiNg and RadiO), envisages to
   bridge the gap and provide innovators a cost-effective, reliable as well
   as efficient platform to develop novel solutions for shared spectrum
   Networked Radar.}},

Abstract = {{Ethernet is widely recognized as an attractive networking technology for
   modern distributed real-time systems. However, standard Ethernet
   components require specific modifications and hardware support to
   provide strict latency guarantees necessary for safety-critical
   applications. Although this is a well-stated fact, the design of
   hardware components for real-time communication remains mostly
   unexplored. This becomes evident from the few solutions reporting
   prototypes and experimental validation, which hinders the consolidation
   of Ethernet in real-world distributed applications.
   This paper presents Atacama, the first open-source framework based on
   reconfigurable hardware for mixed-criticality communication in
   multi-segmented Ethernet networks. Atacama uses specialized modules for
   time-triggered communication of real-time data, which seamlessly
   integrate with a standard infrastructure using regular best-effort
   traffic. Atacama enables low and highly predictable communication
   latency on multi-segmented 1Gbps networks, easy optimization of devices
   for specific application scenarios, and rapid prototyping of new
   protocol characteristics. Researchers can use the open-source design to
   verify our results and build upon the framework, which aims to
   accelerate the development, validation, and adoption of Ethernet-based
   solutions in real-time applications.}},

Abstract = {{There is no alternative of visual percepts to brain for accomplishing
   any easy to complex problem solution. Sustaining in the everyday world
   environment demands a lot from visual information processing of brain.
   But a large number of the human being is devoid of the blessings of
   visual percepts due to biological or accidental causes. This paper
   presents a critique on vision aided systems and suggests an inexpensive
   alternative to develop an aided system for visually impaired persons. We
   propose a real-time solution which utilizes image processing methodology
   and low cost hardware to support the visually impaired for every day
   path navigation and obstacle avoidance. A head mounted camera processes
   the image to identify plausible path and obstacle. The identified path
   direction and obstacle are converted into pre-defined vocabularies with
   audio annotation output to the physically challenged people's ears. This
   method has been tested over varying environmental conditions and is
   found to be effective for visually impaired navigation.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanomyogram (MMG) signals are the mechanical signals obtained from
   muscles during contractions. They are less sensitive to skin impedance,
   sensor placement and require only low cost hardware to process the
   signal. Till date there are only very few applications in which MMG
   signals are used. The work aims at development of a standalone system
   for generating control signals required to drive assistive devices which
   provide support for disabled and elderly people. This paper presents the
   initial phase of the work, which focuses on the development of a fuzzy
   classifier. The classifier is developed to categorize the different
   speeds of elbow movements into rest, slow and fast. For this, MMG signal
   from biceps brachii are acquired and processed. Two time-domain features
   namely, mean absolute value and variance are extorted from the segmented
   data and is given to the fuzzy inference system. The average accuracy of
   the classifier is found to be 72.72\%.}},

Abstract = {{The field of wireless communication has become the hottest area and
   Software Defined Radio (SDR) is revolutionizing it. By bringing much
   functionality as software, SDR reduces the cost of hardware maintenance
   and up-gradation. Open source hardware such as USRP (Universal Software
   Radio Peripheral) and software called GNU Radio-Companion are commonly
   used to do experiments in SDR. Since the cost of USRP is high, a low
   cost set up is needed which is affordable by the student community. In
   this paper a low cost alternative to USRP is proposed using RTL-SDR
   (Realtek Software Defined Radio) which is only used for reception. For
   transmitting purpose, a mixer circuit can be used to map the baseband
   signal to the band that can be received by RTL-SDR on the other end on
   Linux / Windows platform. Initially, the experiment is done in
   simulation. After that, it is tested with low cost hardware such as
   mixer and RTL-SDR. The cost for total transceiver system can be less
   than USD 100 which is 10 times less than the existing one.}},

Abstract = {{3DP (Three Dimensional Printing) technology is one of the SFF (Solid
   Freeform Fabrication) technologies which have recently come into the
   spotlight due to its adaptability to various applications. However,
   commercial 3DP machines are limited as to the use of building material,
   without voiding the warranty on the machine.
   At the same time, a rise in domestic rapid prototyping machines is
   observed, but none of these machines use the 3DP process. Therefore, an
   open source 3DP machine is designed and built. In this study, the
   machine is discussed and the first experiments are carried out to create
   ceramic (alumina and zirconia) membranes with specific physical
   properties.
   The purpose for developing this machine was opening up the opportunity
   to investigate printing ceramic membranes and reactors. Were, contrary
   to many other applications, maximal compaction of the powder during
   deposition is not desirable, to maintain an open structure the walls of
   the printed object. The machine is able to deposit the powder with
   adjustable bulk density, which is used to alter the properties of the
   membrane. The design of the printer (drawings, electronic layout,
   software) is publicly released under an open source license, free for
   others to adapt, build and use, e.g. in academic research. (C) 2013 The

   Point-of-Care in vitro Diagnostics testing and in vivo or in vitro
   samples' morphological data acquisition and processing capabilities, by
   employing custom developed software-tools and adjustments, on any
   commercially available inexpensive digital microscope and adapting it to
   operate also, as a reliable visual spectrophotometer. Second, provides
   for custom-made low-cost hardware and software means, allowing for
   Pulmonary-Sounds acquisition, processing and visualization, setting-up
   thus, a useful electronic Auscultation and Monitoring device. Both

Abstract = {{We present the software-defined radio (SDR) implementation of a Radio
   Frequency IDentification (RFID) Listener, a passive receive-only device
   that decodes the signals exchanged between the RFID Reader and the
   interrogated Tag following the Electronic Product Code Class-1
   Generation-2 standard. Our RFID Listener is based on the open-source
   project GNU Radio. It provides complete flexibility and full control
   over the entire protocol stack down to the physical layer. As such, it
   can be used as a powerful but inexpensive tool for testing and measuring
   the performance of RFID systems in real operating conditions. In this
   paper, we leverage the SDR Listener for a number of experiments that,
   taken collectively, are illustrative of the potential of such tool for
   RFID research. First, we use it to test comparatively different timing
   recovery schemes for the reception of the Tag signal in uplink, through
   the analysis of bit-error statistics measured experimentally. We find
   that the scheme proposed by Harris and Rice based on polyphase filter
   bank displays excellent performance in this context, very close to the
   theoretical bound and with a gain of 5 dB over the more common Mueller
   and Muller scheme. Second, we use the Listener to evaluate the impact of
   frequency nulls in the uplink RFID channel for different indoor
   scenarios. We find that frequency nulls are pronounced particularly in
   the presence of metal objects and obstructions of the Fresnel zone, but
   frequency hopping is effective in counteracting the problem. Our
   experiments show that the signal backscattered by a passive Tag can be
   correctly received up to a distance of 35 m, with low-cost equipment and
   without highly directional antennas.}},

   using low-cost hardware and software tools. Using XBee radio technology
   (Digi International), educational resources, design challenges, and
   laboratories have been developed to support multi robot education for
   undergraduate engineering and information science students. A
   multi-robot design challenge for a regional robot contest, multi-robot
   classroom and laboratory activities, and a programmable controller for
   multi-robot communication are presented. The capabilities of these
   development tools also support multi-robot solutions across several
   low-cost mobile robot platforms, including VEX, Lego NXT, Arduino, and
   beyond. Based on the successes described, educators will have the tools
   to integrate multi-robot technology into the undergraduate STEM

Abstract = {{Nanomaterials such as Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) show a long range of
   properties opening for new applications, but their integration into
   microsystems remains a challenge for widespread use as functional
   materials in electronics and smart systems. This paper presents our work
   towards a process for making complete, integrated CNT / CMOS / MEMS
   systems. We demonstrate the feasibility of the process, using
   room-temperature processing, low-cost equipment and consumables, and
   electrical control with automation possibilities. CNTs are directly
   integrated at the desired positions in the Si microsystem, forming
   closed Si / CNT / Si circuits. These circuits can show rectifying
   (Schottky-like) or near-ohmic behavior. A Si / CNT / Si circuit is shown
   to respond to CO2 presence in Ar atmosphere, indicating the possible of
   monitoring aging/ fermenting of food packaged in inert atmosphere by a
   sensor fabricated by the method investigated in this paper. The
   possibility of functionalization of CNTs is demonstrated, using thermal
   evaporation of Pd. This opens for selective and sensitive sensors for
   various gases and analytes. Detailed microscopic characterization of the
   obtained CNTs are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Direct-conversion radio receivers can provide highly-integrated and
   low-cost hardware solutions for cognitive radio (CR) devices. However,
   such receiver structures are also known to suffer from various RF
   circuit imperfections, especially IQ imbalance. When studying the
   performance of various spectrum sensing methods, most existing work in
   literature neglect the effects of such RF imperfections. In this paper,
   we analyze the performance of a well-known eigenvalue based sensing
   method, namely maximum-to-minimum eigenvalue test, in the challenging
   multichannel spectrum sensing context under sensing receiver RF IQ
   imbalance. It is analytically shown that under RF IQ imbalance, the
   false alarm probability of the spectrum sensor is always higher compared
   to ideal RF front-end case. Then, in order to compensate for such
   degradation in the ability to identify free spectrum, a waveform level
   interference cancellation solution is deployed to enhance the
   performance, and optimum cancellation coefficient together with a
   practical sample estimator are formulated. Extensive computer
   simulations are provided to illustrate the degradation of false alarm
   probability in the presence of practical IQ imbalance values.
   Furthermore, the simulations also show that the proposed interference
   cancellation method can efficiently suppress the IQ imbalance effects,
   achieving identical false alarm probability with the ideal RF front-end
   case.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a method for efficient data acquisition from sensor
   network with large number of nodes is proposed. A specific design allows
   simple device connection in daisy-chain configuration, thus removing
   addressing problems and allowing synchronized sampling design using just
   4 wires. Several limitations are considered to provide mathematical
   model for estimation of maximum number of sensor nodes. An experimental
   setup was designed which demonstrated theoretical ability to acquire
   data from up to 200 sensors with 50 Hz sampling rate using conventional
   low-cost hardware, however, more advanced setup could allow to increase
   maximum number of sensors several times. The wiring structure of the
   network as well as hardware is specifically designed for use in smart
   garments or similar applications that require sensor integration in
   compact environment and low-power, real-time performance.}},

Abstract = {{There is a increasing interest in creating wearable smartphone
   interaction technologies. A novel smartphone wearable hybrid interaction
   framework based on mixed low-cost hardware and software is proposed in
   this work. The software application renders touch-less application
   graphics and status information using smart phone's screen. Augmented
   reality image rendering technology is employed for a convenient
   hand/foot and phone interaction. The users interact with the application
   using hand/foot gesture motion behind the camera, which trigger the
   interaction event and generate activity sequences for interactive
   buffers. The touch-less algorithm provides a core support for
   hand/foot-gesture interaction by accurately detecting and tracking the
   hand/foot gesture. Four proof-of-concept application prototypes are
   developed based on the wearable hybrid framework. The user study
   evaluation demonstrates the social acceptability of the designed
   hand/foot gestures and the usability of the applications on proposed
   wearable hybrid framework with touch-less interaction approach.}},

Abstract = {{Robust velocity and position estimation at high update rates is crucial
   for mobile robot navigation. In recent years optical flow sensors based
   on computer mouse hardware chips have been shown to perform well on

   typical indoor and outdoor low-light conditions, their practical use is
   limited. We present an open source and open hardware design (1) of an
   optical flow sensor based on a machine vision CMOS image sensor for
   indoor and outdoor applications with very high light sensitivity.
   Optical flow is estimated on an ARM Cortex M4 microcontroller in
   real-time at 250 Hz update rate. Angular rate compensation with a
   gyroscope and distance scaling using a ultrasonic sensor are performed
   onboard. The system is designed for further extension and adaption and

Abstract = {{This paper presents a robust velocity estimation algorithm applicable to
   low-cost monocular platform with a tri-axial gyroscope. The algorithm is
   developed based on PX4FLOW platform which is an open software and open
   hardware solution for monocular speed estimation. The paper provides
   three main contributions. The first is the improved robustness achieved
   by various methods including feature block selection, feed-forward
   rotation, motion compensation, failure case detection and filtering. The
   second contribution is the improved performance in terms of resolution
   and search range achieved by adaptive frame interval and advanced search
   algorithm. The final contribution is a systematical strategy for
   parameter selection to fully utilize the hardware resources and optimize
   the performance in different contexts. The performance was benchmarked
   against the PX4FLOW and GPS. Results indicated that the proposed
   algorithm achieved levels of robustness exceeding that of PX4FLOW in
   measuring velocity. Also, the integrated trajectory agreed with the
   position calculated by an on-board GPS system.}},

Abstract = {{Access to a prototype during R\&D can play a crucial role in early
   identification of the weaknesses in the design. Under circumstances that
   a particular commercial subsystem with the exact required specific
   features is unavailable, the realization of such a prototype can be
   delayed. In this paper, an example of rapid prototyping for a
   dual-channel biosignal data acquisition system based on the open-source
   concept is described. The selected biosignal is the finger
   photoplethysmogram. Except for Matlab, all other software components are
   open-source. The hardware design of the optical sensor utilized to
   record the signals is also open-source, making the system extremely
   affordable with the advantage of flexibility and customization. Precise
   timing of the samples allows for proper alignment and delay estimation
   between the acquired traces, useful in arterial stiffness studies.
   Although the results presented concern only two channels, the system has
   the ability to be expanded to six channels. Further possible expansions
   include the addition of custom filtering, on-board data compression and
   advanced GUI.}},

Abstract = {{Although motion correction in medical imaging is well established and
   has attracted much interest and research funding, a gap still exists in
   that there is a lack of reliable, low-cost hardware to enable such
   techniques to be widely adopted in healthcare. For PET, motion during
   scanning causes image blur which degrades image quality and
   quantifiability. In most marker based motion tracking systems used for
   brain imaging, a single tracking tool is fixed to the subject, however
   it is crucially important to ensure that the tool is rigidly fixed to
   the subject's head otherwise the tool may slip and the tracking data
   becomes unreliable. A tracking system has been developed using open
   source code and a single low cost digital camera that tracks multiple,
   small (<= 10 mm(2)) target markers printed onto adhesive paper which are
   attached to the subject's forehead. The system can track the 6 degree of
   freedom motion of the head to sub mm precision and in real-time while
   being robust against facial deformations that may move the target
   markers non-rigidly. In this study a standard, consumer grade, visible
   light webcam was used with a resolution of 1600 x 1200, operated at 30
   Hz, and achieved simultaneous tracking of multiple markers with 0.2 mm
   and 0.3 degrees mean error. Calibration to PET space was performed using
   simultaneous tracking of a F-18 point source doped marker with mean
   positional error of 0.7 mm.}},

Abstract = {{Human Computer Interaction (HCI) is one of the major disciplines in the
   field of computing which defines the way people interact with machines.
   HCI is a combination of computer science, behavioral science, design and
   several other areas which determines the best and optimized ways to
   interact with computers. The way people interact with machines changed
   dramatically after the 21st century due to the advancements of the
   computing devices. Computers became more portable and embedded to the
   environment with the improvement of processing power and miniaturization
   of devices. New concepts such as ubiquitous computing are also emerged
   with these advancements of technology. Traditional HCI concepts were
   failed to meet the requirements of the emerging technologies since most
   of these new concepts requires natural interactions rather using
   tangible devices. This paper present a computer vision based interactive
   surface application for human computer interaction which enable users to
   perform QWERTY keyboard and mouse interactions on a flat surface.
   Primarily, this research addresses the existing issues related to
   gesture based interactive interfaces by presenting a novel approach to
   perform interactions without stereoscopic vision and wearable markers.
   The proposing approach present a system (V-Touch) based on Haar-like
   features with single camera and a laser projection module that allows
   users to perform traditional keyboard and mouse interactions naturally
   using low cost hardware setup.}},

Abstract = {{The use of proprietary and licensed softwares for computational use
   cannot be taken for granted, especially in academia. Use of open source
   computational softwares like Scilab should be encouraged at all levels.
   Any desktop based computation software package's use can often be
   limited by its hardware requirements and most of them are not yet ready
   for the next generation of low cost hardware devices. Here we present a
   cloud based service model that allows user to run Scilab codes from
   remote locations using just a browser. We have also come up with a
   comprehensive database of Scilab examples from engineering textbooks :
   Textbook Companion Project. The user can select from a pool of more than
   6000 Scilab examples and run it directly from the browser, thus making
   installation of Scilab natively unessential. Scilab on Cloud is offered
   as a Web 2.0 service with a public application programming
   interface(API) which can be used freely to execute codes on the cloud as
   a SaaS(Software as a Service). This service not only provides an
   educational interface to Scilab beginners but also makes Scilab
   computing accessible to low cost and minimal hardware computational

Abstract = {{In order to overcome the shortages that motion-level robot language is
   difficult to be transplanted, robot's functions are difficult to be
   extended because of the closed language environment and lacking of a
   standard motion-level robot language among robot manufacturers, a
   compiling and interpreting system of industrial robot which is based on
   the Lua script language in an open hardware control system is proposed.
   In this system, a set of more relatively general-used motion-level robot
   language has been designed. The structure of the software has been
   designed in using of object-oriented programming and the functions of
   the software have also been modularized to facilitate function
   extending. Implementation strategy of the interpreting part has been
   also designed in using of chain of responsibility pattern. Thus, the
   compiling and interpreting system becomes fully open-ended. The software
   which is constructed by the system has been demonstrated on Visual
   Studio 2008 platform, the experimental results indicate that the robot
   can move accurately under the control of the software and the functions
   of the software can be extended conveniently, thereby proves the
   compiling and interpreting system to be a suitable and effective method.}},

Abstract = {{Medical imaging has become an absolutely essential diagnostic tool for
   clinical practices; at present, pathologies can be detected with an
   earliness never before known. Its use has not only been relegated to the
   field of radiology but also, increasingly, to computer-based imaging
   processes prior to surgery. Motion analysis, in particular, plays an
   important role in analyzing activities or behaviors of live objects in
   medicine. This short paper presents several low-cost hardware
   implementation approaches for the new generation of tablets and/or
   smartphones for estimating motion compensation and segmentation in
   medical images. These systems have been optimized for breast cancer
   diagnosis using magnetic resonance imaging technology with several
   advantages over traditional X-ray mammography, for example, obtaining
   patient information during a short period. This paper also addresses the
   challenge of offering a medical tool that runs on widespread portable
   devices, both on tablets and/or smartphones to aid in patient

Abstract = {{This article examines the open paradigm in design research and
   introduces a new conceptualization for `open design' and a three-layer

   the data gathered during the design process, and the commercialization
   of the end-product. The aspects of the product and the process merge in
   this framework, intertwining the aspects of technical, legal and
   commercial openness. Finally, the article proposes a research agenda for
   open design. The article builds on an extensive literature review about
   studies on `open' in design: open-source software, open hardware, and

Abstract = {{Notwithstanding laser scanning technology is a mature technology used in
   widening application fields, a variety of barriers hinds its integration
   in robotized production lines. To face well know problems, as high-costs
   and not customizable solutions among others, the authors have developed
   a new family of laser scanning devices based on off the shelves and low
   cost hardware components and on a modular design that allow the
   customization of the device according to the specific application
   requirements. High accuracy is guaranteed through a computationally
   efficient non-parametric calibration procedure. Keeping limited the
   overall cost of the solution provided while increasing in general the
   sensing capabilities of an Industrial Robot (IR) and in particular the
   autonomous recognition of position, orientation and furthermore shape
   and geometrical features of objects within the robotic workspace, can
   boost the penetration of IRs in typical traditional industrial sectors
   where SMEs productive scenario is mainly characterized by manual
   fabrication processes, high product variability, small batches and
   little capital investments. High added value footwear industry is a
   paradigmatic example where hard automation is limited from one side by
   high variability of products and huge request of autonomous adaptation
   to cope with different loosely structured fabrication processes and from
   the other side by a low propensity towards high capital investment that
   make difficult the penetration of industrial robots. Within the
   framework of the European Project ROBOFOOT (EU-FP7-SMP), authors have
   conceived and developed a new family of low cost modular and
   reconfigurable laser scanners and successfully applied in the footwear
   fabrication scenario. Various operations should be improved by actual
   measure of the shoe being manufactured, and among the others, the
   identification of the relative positioning between the last (the plastic
   clement on top of which is built the shoe) and the gripping device is
   extremely critical because it is still performed manually. Positioning
   errors in this phase are critical since all robot part-programs depend
   on the correct alignment of the last with the robot end-effector. To
   face this problem, a procedure, based on the Iterative Closest Points
   (ICP) optimization method, has been developed and integrated on board of
   the laser scanning device that directly communicates with the robot
   controller to adapt and autonomously correct the part-program to align
   the tool nominal path with the actual shoe being manufactured. Efficacy
   of the proposed methods has been proved by measuring the interaction
   forces between the tool and the last handled by a robot during different
   technological operations (roughing, polishing etc) typical of the shoe
   fabrication cycle. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. Open

Pages = {{803-810}},
Abstract = {{Technical progress in the open-source self replicating rapid prototyper
   (RepRap) community has enabled a distributed form of additive
   manufacturing to expand rapidly using polymer-based materials. However,
   the lack of an open-source metal alternative and the high capital costs
   and slow throughput of proprietary commercialized metal 3-D printers has
   severely restricted their deployment. The applications of commercialized
   metal 3-D printers are limited to only rapid prototyping and expensive
   finished products. This severely restricts the access of the technology
   for small and medium enterprises, the developing world and for use in
   laboratories. This paper reports on the development of a <\$2000
   open-source metal 3-D printer. The metal 3-D printer is controlled with
   an open-source micro-controller and is a combination of a low-cost
   commercial gas-metal arc welder and a derivative of the Rostock, a
   deltabot RepRap. The bill of materials, electrical and mechanical design
   schematics, and basic construction and operating procedures are
   provided. A preliminary technical analysis of the properties of the 3-D
   printer and the resultant steel products are performed. The results of
   printing customized functional metal parts are discussed and conclusions
   are drawn about the potential for the technology and the future work
   necessary for the mass distribution of this technology.}},

   was firstly put forward to absorb the additional pollutants between the
   old and the new Chinese emission standards. Designed of the equipment
   was proceeded based on the uniform bag filtration and the AC absorption.
   The absorber was optimized by the flow field simulation. Two guide
   plates' angle of 45 degrees, the uniformly distributed bags and the
   opposed bend pipes can make the flow field in the IPCE uniform. The
   large AC inlet velocity is good for the uniform AC distribution.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular combing is an established technique for aligning DNA nanowires
   on a surface. When performed on micro-patterned surfaces, this technique
   can be used to reliably align and stretch DNA nanowires across micro
   pillars. Imprinting of these aligned DNA nanowires is an affordable
   technique for fabrication of arrays of nano-scale channels across
   micro-scale reservoirs. In the past, DNA combing and imprinting (DCI)
   have been performed manually to fabricate polymer chips that are used in
   biomedical applications such as gene therapy and drug delivery studies.
   Automation of the DCI process is necessary to improve the yield and to
   scale-up production for these applications. However, existing automated
   techniques are not appropriate for DNA nanowire imprinting because these
   techniques cannot handle (i) fragile stamps and (ii) individual chip
   scale stamps of size similar to 1 cm(2). Herein, we present the design,
   fabrication and performance evaluation of an imprinting stage that
   enables (i) handling fragile stamps via low-cost equipment and (ii)
   production scale-up via simultaneous handling of multiple stamps. The
   stage is based on a self-aligning imprinting technique that passively
   aligns a stamp parallel to the substrate thereby enabling simultaneous
   imprinting of multiple stamps via a single stage. This self-alignment
   technique minimizes nanowire breakage by ensuring (i) minimal in-plane
   stamp motion during imprinting and (ii) that the contact forces do not
   exceed the weight of the stamp. Based on this technique we have
   designed/fabricated a stage that can simultaneously handle three stamps
   and is capable of further scale-up. The stage consists of a movable
   platform that is mounted on linear bearings and is actuated via a
   stepper motor. Stamps are loaded onto a holder that is mounted on the
   movable platform via kinematic couplings. This allows one to rapidly
   attach and detach the holder from the stage and also makes it possible
   to handle fragile stamps during loading/unloading. Imprinting of DNA
   nanowires with a manual stage has demonstrated the feasibility of the
   self-alignment scheme. Experiments that were performed to test the
   alignment capability of the stage verify that conformal stamp contact
   can be achieved across all three stamps even in the presence of an
   angular misalignment of 5 between the stamp and the glass slide. This
   ability to simultaneously align multiple stamps is a critical step in
   being able to scale-up and fully automate the DCI process.}},

Abstract = {{Photovoltaic (PV) systems are growing popular nowadays due to the
   incessant demand for power. This has resulted in increased awareness and
   interest among the engineering students to learn these systems. However,
   PV related laboratory courses have ceased to exist due to the cost of PV
   panels and the relevant equipment required as well as the complexity
   involved in handling and testing of such systems mainly due to the
   dependence on the external weather conditions. This work proposes low
   cost and low power equipment for hands on experimentation of concepts
   like VI curves, Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT), partial shading,
   interconnection schemes to enhance the power generation in a PV array
   etc., in a laboratory at an undergraduate level. The experimental setup
   along with the procedure for performing the experiments in a compendious
   manner has been explained for various real life problems in PV
   generation systems. The outcomes of the proposed prototype with small
   rating PV cells and artificial light sources demonstrate the articulate
   nature as well as the didactic contributions of the equipment.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of the project was to investigate the flight behavior of a
   futuristic blended wing body concept in high altitudes. The shape to be
   tested was based on cooperation with its Swiss inventor Koni Schafroth
   from Team Smartfish {[}I]. The overall motivation for the project is the
   search for new reentry technologies. VEXREDUS stands for Vehicle with
   EXtended REentry Duration University of Stuttgart{''}, referring to
   reentry vehicles with a high Lift to Drag ratio.
   The project work involved the following tasks:
   CNC/CAM based mold construction
   Building of airframe in CFRP/GFRP sandwich technology
   Development of own autopilot software on existing open source hardware
   Implementation of own telemetry protocol
   Development of a ground station
   Development of a Redundant power supply
   Development of a parachute system
   Thermal and vacuum testing
   As a BEXUS team we were part of two launch campaigns at the ESRANGE
   facility in Northern Sweden. Though we had our share of setbacks, we
   were able to demonstrate the airframe's excellent flying characteristics
   and suitability for high altitude missions. The paper shall take a look
   at the technical challenges we've been facing and the investigations we
   made to learn more about the things that didn't work as expected, as
   well as the results drawn from the whole experiment.}},

Abstract = {{Second-Order Extended Kalman Filter (EKF2) is an elaboration of Extended
   Kalman Filter (EKF) that takes the nonlinearity of the measurements
   models into consideration and performances better than EKF in accuracy
   and filtering, but the computational complexity of EKF2 is larger than
   EKF. In this paper, a low-complexity second-order extended Kalman filter
   algorithm (LEKF2) is proposed for GPS positioning having the same
   performance with EKF2 and almost the same complexity with EKF. The
   second-order Taylor expansions of measurements are used to derive the
   algorithm process according the Kalman theory, and then modifying the
   algorithm process, especially the Kalman Gain matrix and the error
   covariance matrix, to meet the requirements of stability and
   computational burden. The computation analyses show that the
   computations of LEKF2 are greatly reduced, e.g. a reduction of up to
   about 60\% for EKF2 positioning algorithm, which is the same as EKF. The
   static and dynamic simulations of LEKF2, EKF and EKF2 show that they
   have similar performance and the second-order algorithms are better than
   first-order algorithm in filtering. Long time static testing under
   multipath improve LEKF2 stability and accuracy, meanwhile, dynamic tests
   under weak signal and multipath show that LEKF2 also does well at
   filtering. Hence, the proposed algorithm LEKF2 offers potential for
   low-cost hardware implementation for hybrid positioning and other
   applications and is greatly light on positioning computational load with
   a good performance.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: eHealth tools and telemedicine systems have become
   commonly used to provide better care to patients located in remote areas
   or regions lacking in specialized medical opinion. These improvements
   can be achieved by continuous education of local health professionals,
   remote evaluation of patient exams or second opinions on clinical cases,
   given by experts located in reference centres. However, in order to
   enable this swift information exchange, it is necessary to make use of
   digital - technology. Unfortunately, small clinics and health care units
   do not always have the financial resources to acquire new digital
   equipment and/or do not want to dispose of their analogical devices.
   Therefore, alternative methods must be made available. Objective: The
   present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of photographed ECGs
   (Photo-ECGs) as an alternative tool for facilitating remote cardiologic
   second opinion. Methods: Three hundred and one paper ECGs were
   photographed twice (n=602), using a Canon digital camera and a Nokia
   mobile phone with integrated camera. A series of pilot studies
   determined the best configuration that should be used for each camera.
   The Photo-ECGs were then randomized, encrypted and sent (single-blind)
   to two physicians by email, together with an evaluation form containing
   gender and age only, while the paper ECGs were delivered personally
   without randomization. Concordance between results of the paper ECGs and
   their respective Photo-ECGs were evaluated by the weighted Kappa, giving
   an average K = 0.508 for the camera Photo-ECGs and an average K = 0.511

Abstract = {{TV White Spaces (TVWS) technology and regulation has the potential to
   make connectivity both technically and economically feasible in rural
   Africa where affordable access remains a challenge. The superior
   propagation characteristics of TVWS technology make it particularly well
   suited to connecting remote communities. Evidence collected from our
   measurements in Malawi and Zambia suggest that most UHF spectrum is
   already available both in urban as well as in rural areas and could be
   used to provide Internet connectivity. In this paper we present the
   findings of a TVWS spectrum measurement initiative in Malawi and Zambia.
   We introduce an open hardware device that geo-tags spectrum measurements
   and saves the results on a micro SD card. The device can also be used to
   record the use of spectrum over long periods of time.}},

Abstract = {{There have been several recent developments in Open Source Hardware that
   enable the creation of relatively low-cost sensors for remote
   deployment. The initial work done by ICFOSS for soil and atmosphere
   monitoring sensor networks, where the sensors had wired connections
   within each node, had limited their deployment to very short distances
   around the node. A hybrid approach using a mesh network consisting of
   `motes'-based sensors is proposed in conjunction with the Raspberry
   Pi-based management layer to un-tether the sensors, leading to
   simplified field-based deployments. This approach enables multiple
   applications such as remote monitoring for disaster management,
   precision agriculture, wildlife monitoring or pollution monitoring in
   urban areas.}},

Abstract = {{For rural areas, wireless is the only viable alternative for providing
   affordable telecommunications services. One limiting factor to the
   growth of wireless broadband penetration is the lack of available
   spectrum. White Spaces broadband uses gaps in spectrum bands that have
   been reserved for TV broadcasts. These frequencies offer significant
   capacity to help alleviate pressures on existing wireless networks and
   allow connectivity in remote areas due to their good propagation
   capabilities. This paper describes an assessment study on TV White
   Spaces availability in Malawi using affordable tools. The conclusion of
   the study is that 1) it is possible to assess the spectrum usage using
   low cost equipment 2) ample spectrum for TV White Spaces deployment is
   available in Malawi.}},

Abstract = {{Outdoor air pollution now contributes annually to over 3.2 million
   premature deaths worldwide and is among the top health risk factors.
   Urban air pollution is on course to become the top environmental cause
   of mortality by 2050 - greater than the effects of dirty water and lack
   of sanitation. This risk is especially high in developing countries,
   where it is often difficult or expensive to obtain air quality data.
   This paper outlines the initial development of a system for mapping
   crowd-sourced air quality data in urban environments in developing
   countries. This system includes a (1) low cost wearable air quality
   monitor and (2) a mapping and data visualization web application for use
   in urban settings in developing countries. Based on open source hardware
   and software, the air quality monitor is composed of an Arduino
   microcontroller and sensor shields and collects real-time geographically
   explicit air quality data, with data storage on removable memory. The
   mapping and data visualization web application uses javascript functions
   and Google Maps API to visualize the paths travelled and the intensity
   of ozone and particulate matter as a heat map.}},

Abstract = {{3D reconstruction has been already one of the most interesting research
   areas among photogrammetry and computer vision researchers. This thesis
   aims to evaluate digital fringe projection method in reconstruction of
   small objects with complicated shape. Digital fringe projection method
   is a novel method in structured light technique which integrates
   interferometric and triangulation methods. In this method, a digital
   projector projects a series of sinusoidal fringe patterns onto the
   object surface. Then, a camera from a different point of view captures
   images of patterns that are deformed due to object's surface topography.
   Afterward, the captured images will be processed and the depth related
   phase would be calculated. Due to using arctangent function in the
   process of phase extraction, the computed phase ranges from -pi to +pi,
   so a phase unwrapping step is necessary. Finally, the unwrapped phase
   map would be converted to depth map with some mathematical models. This
   method has many advantages like high speed, high accuracy, low cost
   hardware, high resolution (each pixel will have a depth at end), and
   simple computations.
   This paper aims to evaluate different parameters which affect the
   accuracy of the final results. For this purpose, some test were designed
   and implemented. These tests assess the number of phase shifts, spatial
   frequency of the fringe pattern, light condition, noise level of images,
   and the color and material of target objects on the quality of resulted
   phase map. The evaluation results demonstrate that digital fringe
   projection method is capable of obtaining depth map of complicated
   object with high accuracy. The contrast test results showed that this
   method is able to work under different ambient light condition; although
   at places with high light condition will not work properly. The results
   of implementation on different objects with various materials, color and
   shapes demonstrate the high capability of this method of 3D
   reconstruction.}},
