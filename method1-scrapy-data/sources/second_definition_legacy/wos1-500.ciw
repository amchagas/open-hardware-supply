AB Air pollution is a serious problem and has caused public health concerns all over the world. Despite the evidence, the preparedness and response of citizens has been limited. This underlines the importance of having sustainable air quality monitoring solutions that foster inclusion and multi-stakeholder partnerships for social-scientific interventions. This study illustrates how AirBox project has emerged in Taiwan, where makers and citizens use the sensors to sense air quality and provide the public with actionable data about their environments. The AirBox project includes elements of technology-innovation and citizen science: (1) Participatory Sensing ? Static and mobile air quality sensing, (2) Open Data ? Open hardware, software and access to data, (3) Co-creation Citizen Science ? Citizen-led campaigns and forums, and (4) Outreach ? Knowledge sharing, trust building and multi-stakeholder collaboration. The project uses a wide range of sensors to provide extendable solutions and data at fine spatio-temporal resolution. The results are highlighted using five cases studies that show how integrating social dimensions in an air quality monitoring framework can lead to public awareness, data-driven applications and environmentally sustainable cities. The multi-faceted approach highlights the effects of a bottom-up citizen science approach that considers local culture, practices and problems at grassroots.

DE Purchasing portfolio model; Segmentation model; Military logistics;

AB This study explains the constructs of a purchasing portfolio model (PPM) that defence authorities can use in practice in defence procurement and designs a segmentation model. We identify open PPM design and application questions in the literature and conduct a Delphi study with twenty experts from Swedish defence authorities to design a segmentation model that is fit-for-purpose. The paper addresses the open design and application questions discussed in the literature and satisfies the operational requirements of the Swedish Armed Forces (SwAF). The proposed segmentation model builds on three dimensions: the operational requirements of the SwAF, the market's ability to deliver supplies on time, and limitations in the SwAF operational capability if the market does not deliver supplies on time. To reduce complexity, we propose a two-stage model in which we use one dimension as a precursor to a two-dimensional model. In the latter, we merge sixteen elements into one square along with three other segments which users should treat differently. The paper contributes to extant academic knowledge on PPMs by eliciting practitioners' views on open design and application questions. We develop the proposed segmentation model in cooperation with practitioners and believe that it will be of value in defence procurement practice.

AB Recently, the passive seismic techniques based on the microtremor measurements have emerged as an alternative to conventional seismic and geotechnical methods used in engineering seismology and earthquake engineering, especially in the local site effect investigations. These methods are basically based on the recording of seismic ambient noise and analysis of its spectral features. Although these techniques are more practical than traditional seismic methods, the commercial instruments designed for recording the seismic ambient noise are quite expensive. Furthermore, most of these instruments require an external computer for recording and monitoring the data. In this sense, this article intends to present a low-cost and Raspberry Pi single-board microcomputer aided seismic ambient noise recording and monitoring system (RaspMI) as an alternative to the computer aided commercial seismic noise measurement systems. RaspMI is an open-source hardware and software system that is controlled by a graphical user interface developed by using the MonoDevelop cross-platform and C# programming language. This system has many features such as 72 dB dynamic range, 100 Hz sampling frequency, timer recording mode, text and SAC data file format, and latitude, longitude, date and time support with GPS module. RaspMI has subjected to the various tests in terms of the reliability and sensitivity. The obtained results have shown that RaspMI can be used as an alternative instrument for seismic ambient noise measurements.

DE Retrofit; EnergyPlus; Solar air collector; Monitoring; Arduino
AB In this research, a full rehabilitation study (retrofit) of an isolated villa in a Mediterranean climate was carried out in order to show how a retrofit of a building with a combination of simple passive and active strategies can improve the sustainability, energy efficiency and the thermal comfort. This is performed thanks to the design of a methodology of using a thermal simulation tool with experimental measurements based on a low-cost open source hardware platform in order to evaluate the energy saving measures and analyse the thermal comfort and energy savings. To accomplish this, a study of the housing needs is performed a priori to later design the different actions in the rehabilitation, using if possible, ecological materials in its development. Basically, walls and ceilings are insulated, three solar air collectors are included to heat the air ventilation and decrease the heating demand, and two pellet stoves are installed. Finally, the refurbished house is modeled and simulated in EnergyPlus and compared with the indoor air temperature and relative humidity measurements, made using an Open-Source Monitoring System (OSMS) developed for this research in Arduino, obtaining results with no significant differences without the need to calibrate the system. The results of thermal comfort, heating and cooling demand and heating energy consumption of the house before and after the renovation are compared providing a decrease in thermal demand of 66% and a decrease in heating energy consumption of 50% in the winter season, where 60% of the energy consumed is contributed from renewable sources. In terms of thermal comfort, the comparison of the PPD and PMV values shows an improvement in the house in heating and cooling season.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Do-it-yourself; open design; replicability; residential rainwater
   harvesting systems; sustainability
AB Open design (OD) is a promising approach to address global sustainability challenges. At the same time, however, the increased use of OD brings new challenges. To understand the potential of OD in a specific context, we adopted the concept of a residential rainwater harvesting system (RWHS) as a case study. We first identified the critical design features of the RWHS. After that, we analysed the potential for local reproduction of these features at the grassroots level of low-income communities in developing countries. This analysis revealed that varying limitations related to materials, skills, and manufacturing tools may hamper the adoption of OD by local communities when trying to improve their water management. In the light of our findings, we argue that OD processes are likely to face challenges if replicability, substitutability and adaptability are not successfully integrated into the design. We suggest a design-for-frugality mindset and adoption of parametric design processes and design parameters as key strategies to boost OD processes in low-income communities. We also stress the importance of safety and liability aspects in the studied context.

AB Air, water, and soil are essential for terrestrial life, but pollution, overexploitation, and climate change jeopardize the availability of these primary resources. Thus, assuring human health and food production requires efficient strategies and technologies for environmental protection. Knowing key parameters such as soil moisture, air, and water quality is essential for smart farming and urban development. The MeteoMex project aims to build simple hardware kits and their integration into current Internet-of-Things (IoT) platforms. This paper shows the use of low-end Wemos D1 mini boards to connect environmental sensors to the open-source platform ThingsBoard. Two printed circuit boards (PCB) were designed for mounting components. Analog, digital and (IC)-C-2 sensors are supported. The Wemos ESP8266 microchip provides WiFi capability and can be programed with the Arduino IDE. Application examples for the MeteoMex aeria and terra kits demonstrate their functionality for air quality, soil, and climate monitoring. Further, a prototype for monitoring wastewater treatment is shown, which exemplifies the capabilities of the Wemos board for signal processing. The data are stored in a PostgreSQL database, which enables data mining. The MeteoMex IoT system is highly scalable and of low cost, which makes it suitable for deployment in agriculture 4.0, industries, and public areas. Circuit drawings, PCB layouts, and code examples are free to download from https://github.com/robert-winkler/MeteoMex.

AB Home anomaly monitoring is crucial for the elderly who live alone. A number of IoT-based home monitoring systems have been available, but most rely on privacy-intrusive cameras. With more and more concerns on privacy and security of human data, anomaly detection based on nonintrusive IoT devices becomes more desirable. Considering the elderly consumers, a low-cost system with good detection accuracy is further critical for the system's acceptability by elderly users. We propose a smart home monitoring system for living-alone senior citizens, relying on carefully designed, low-cost infrared sensor devices, as well as a cloud-based data processing and anomaly detection platform. Our PIR sensor device is effective in continuous monitoring of motion data in a user's apartment, and an open-hardware software platform is devised to support sensors manufactured by various vendors in the IoT system, all for cost reduction purpose. For privacy preservation, we encrypt collected data and store data indices in a blockchain system, to achieve efficient data access control and auditing. For motion anomaly detection, we propose a simple but effective environment adaptation method to work with the one-class support vector machine (OCSVM) method. Experiments driven by real-world traces show good reliability, accuracy, and efficiency of our system.

AB In recent years, a trend toward utilizing open access resources for laboratory research has begun. Open-source design strategies for scientific hardware rely upon the use of widely available parts, especially those that can be directly printed using additive manufacturing techniques and electronic components that can be connected to low-cost microcontrollers. Open-source software eliminates the need for expensive commercial licenses and provides the opportunity to design programs for specific needs. In this review, the impact of the "open-source movement" within the field of chemical separations is described, primarily through a comprehensive look at research in this area over the past five years. Topics that are covered include general laboratory equipment, sample preparation techniques, separations-based analysis, detection strategies, electronic system control, and software for data processing. Remaining hurdles and possible opportunities for further adoption of open-source approaches in the context of these separations-related topics are also discussed. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB Robotic observatories are ideal infrastructures that can be remotely accessed by scientists, amateurs, and general public for research and education in Astronomy. Its robotization is a complex process for ensuring autonomy, safety, and coordination among all subsystems. Some observatories, such as Francisco Sanchez's, are equipped with two types of telescopes: one for the night and one for the day. The night-time telescope must be protected from exposure to sunlight in order to use them in an automated way. For this purpose, this article proposes the design and construction of a smart cover that opens and closes according to the time of day. The mechatronic design covers the electronic, mechanical, and software programming, and it has been devised taking while taking the principles of open design, ease of reproduction, low-cost, and smart behaviour into account. The design has been parameterized, so that it can be adapted to telescopes of any size. The final prototype is lightweight, cost-effective, and can be built while using common 3D printing and PCB milling machines. The complete design is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 and all the documentation, schematics, and software are available in public repositories, like Zenodo, GitHub, and Instructables.

AB In this paper, we describe the main outcomes of AGILE (acronym for "Adaptive Gateways for dIverse muLtiple Environments"), an EU-funded project that recently delivered a modular hardware and software framework conceived to address the fragmented market of embedded, multi-service, adaptive gateways for the Internet of Things (IoT). Its main goal is to provide a low-cost solution capable of supporting proof-of-concept implementations and rapid prototyping methodologies for both consumer and industrial IoT markets. AGILE allows developers to implement and deliver a complete (software and hardware) IoT solution for managing non-IP IoT devices through a multi-service gateway. Moreover, it simplifies the access of startups to the IoT market, not only providing an efficient and cost-effective solution for industries but also allowing end-users to customize and extend it according to their specific requirements. This flexibility is the result of the joint experience of established organizations in the project consortium already promoting the principles of openness, both at the software and hardware levels. We illustrate how the AGILE framework can provide a cost-effective yet solid and highly customizable, technological foundation supporting the configuration, deployment, and assessment of two distinct showcases, namely a quantified self application for individual consumers, and an air pollution monitoring station for industrial settings.

AB Spatial light modulators (SLMs) are key research tools in several contemporary applied optics research domains. In this paper, we present the argument that an open platform for interacting with SLMs would dramatically increase their accessibility to researchers. We introduce HoloBlade, an open-hardware implementation of an SLM driver-stack, and provide a detailed exposition of HoloBlade's architecture, key components, and detailed design. An optical verification rig is constructed to demonstrate that HoloBlade can provide Fourier imaging capability in a 4f system. Finally, we discuss HoloBlade's future development roadmap and the opportunities that it presents as a research tool for applied optics. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America

AB Objective. Researchers are developing biomedical devices with embedded closed-loop algorithms for providing advanced adaptive therapies. As these devices become more capable and algorithms become more complex, tasked with integrating and interpreting multi-channel, multi-modal electrophysiological signals, there is a need for flexible bench-top testing and prototyping. We present a methodology for leveraging off-the-shelf audio equipment to construct a biosignal waveform generator capable of streaming pre-recorded biosignals from a host computer. By re-playing known, well-characterized, but physiologically relevant real-world biosignals into a device under test, researchers can evaluate their systems without the need for expensive in vivo experiments. Approach. An open-source design based on the proposed methodology is described and validated, the NeuroDAC. NeuroDAC allows for 8 independent channels of biosignal playback using a simple, custom designed attenuation and buffering circuit. Applications can communicate with the device over a USB interface using standard audio drivers. On-board analog amplitude adjustment is used to maximize the dynamic range for a given signal and can be independently tuned for each channel. Main results. Low noise component selection yields a no-signal noise floor of just 5.35 +/- 0.063. NeuroDAC's frequency response is characterized with a high pass -3 dB rolloff at 0.57 Hz, and is capable of accurately reproducing a wide assortment of biosignals ranging from EMG, EEG, and ECG to extracellularly recorded neural activity. We also present an application example using the device to test embedded algorithms on a closed-loop neural modulation device, the Medtronic RC+S. Significance. By making the design of NeuroDAC open-source we aim to present an accessible tool for rapidly prototyping new biomedical devices and algorithms than can be easily modified based on individual testing needs.

AB In this work, an omnidirectional sensor that enables identification of the direction of the celestial sphere with maximum solar irradiance is presented. The sensor, based on instantaneous measurements, functions as a position server for dual-axis solar trackers in photovoltaic plants. The proposed device has been developed with free software and hardware, which makes it a pioneering solution because it is open and accessible as well as capable of being improved by the scientific community, thereby contributing to the rapid advancement of technology. In addition, the device includes an algorithm developed ex professo that makes it possible to predetermine the regions of the celestial sphere for which, according to the geometric characteristics of the PV plant, there would be shading between the panels. In this way, solar trackers do not have to locate the Sun's position at all times according to astronomical models, while taking into account factors such as shadows or cloudiness that also affect levels of incident irradiance on solar collectors. Therefore, with this device, it is possible to provide photovoltaic plants with dual-axis solar tracking with a low-cost device that helps to optimise the trajectory of the trackers and, consequently, their radiative capture and energy production.

AB To meet various requirements for electron transfer (ET) at the substrate/electrolyte interface, mixed redox couples assigned to different functions have been applied. While in all studies the mixed redox species had different redox potentials, such redox systems inherently lose energy by ET between the species. We report interfacial ET kinetics employing mixed-ligand electrolytes based on Co2+/3+ complexes with mixtures of dimethyl- and dinonyl-substituted bipyridyl (bpy) ligands with the same redox potential. The ET rates of the mixed electrolytes decrease with the increasing ratio of the dinonyl-bpy ligand, with substrates adsorbed by molecules without alkyl chains due to a blocking effect. However, when the molecules on substrates have four alkyl chains, the ET rate between the molecules and the electrolytes with increasing ratio of the dinonyl-bpy ligand is enhanced. The substrate-dependent behavior is explained by selective intermolecular interactions. The results open design flexibility for mixed-redox electrolyte systems to control ET at multi-substrate interfaces and provide a novel means to tune ET rates simultaneously for various ET processes in a system without losing energy by the ET.

AB It is important for agricultural chemical applicators to follow proper spray procedures to prevent susceptible crops, animals, people, or other living organisms from being injured far downwind. Spraying during stable atmospheric conditions should be avoided to prevent surface-temperature inversion-induced off-target drift of crop protection materials. Previous statistical analysis determined times of high likelihood of stable atmospheric conditions, which are unfavorable for spraying, during the day under clear and cloudy conditions in hot summer months in the Mississippi Delta. Results validated the thresholds of temperature increase in the morning and temperature drop in the afternoon with wind speeds and the transition between stable and unstable atmospheric conditions. With this information, an algorithm was developed to calculate if atmospheric conditions were favorable for spraying based on field temperature and wind speed at any instant. With this algorithm, a web application was built to provide real-time determination of atmospheric stability and hourly online recommendation of whether aerial applications were appropriate for a location and time in the Mississippi Delta. This study further developed another web application specifically for Stoneville, Mississippi, with data measured from weather stations constructed from inexpensive open-source electronics, accessories, and software for more accurate online guidance for site-specific drift management. The web application is adapted for accessing on mobile terminals, such as smartphones and tablets, and provides timely guidance for aerial applicators and producers to avoid spray drift and air quality issues long distances downwind in the area.

AB The courses and disciplines in the exact sciences are based on practical work (PW) which complements the theoretical teaching. Remote Labs are a recent approach used for educating experimental manipulations by using the performance of information and communication technologies. This work aims to propose the design of an IoT system allowing several remote manipulations in analog electronics. This solution is mainly based on the Red Pitaya STEMLab board, in particular for communication and remote control for measurements and data acquisition through different protocols. The low-cost system provides an intelligent selection between the different integrated practical works on a developed board, as well as other ones carried out externally as extensions according to the professor's needs. The analysis of the integrated manipulations was done taking into account the minimum latency of the remote control as well as its portability to save time, space, and money without loss of quality and quantity. The presented results relate to a PW of analog electronics, a "RC charging and discharging circuit" has been considered for a comparison of this Remote system with the same PW performed by the classical method "hands-on laboratory". Our purpose in this study is the development of a control system to maximize the available resource as well as to improve self-learning ability in the electronic field.

AB To secure various forms of data, a polymorphic variant of the Advanced Encryption Standard (P-AES) has been introduced. In the P-AES, the AES parameters' values will change with every new key. The exact values will be available only to legitimate communicating parties during execution time. To achieve these objectives, the basic AES transformations, SubBytes, ShiftRows, and MixColumns, have been made key-dependent in the proposed P-AES. Hence, with every new key, these transformations will operate differently. The receiver can retrieve the operations' details from the encryption key. Consequently, polymorphism has been achieved and interoperability remains intact. P-AES has been implemented seamlessly using the existing AES modules, and the performance was more or less equal to the AES performance (71 and 70 milliseconds to encrypt 500 bytes using the P-AES and the AES respectively). From a security standpoint, the proposed P-AES fully complies with Kerckhoff's principle. This means the cipher has an open design, and the security provided by the P-AES depends only on the secrecy of the encryption key. The cipher resistance to differential and linear attacks has been proved. Moreover, the resulting proposed cipher can operate in 128 different ways, which will significantly reduce the capabilities of any sophisticated attacker. Furthermore, the proposed P-AES's scores of the key avalanche and the plaintext avalanche were 0.496 and 0.504 respectively. Finally, the Statistical Test Suite (STS) recommended by the NIST has been used to ensure the randomness of the cipher output, and the cipher has passed all the STS tests.

TI SOTPM: Software One-Time Programmable Memory to Protect Shared Memory on
   ARM Trustzone
SO IEEE ACCESS
LA English

DE ARM TrustZone; secure communication; shared memory
ID SECURE
AB In ARM TrustZone-based architecture, shared memory is one of the most useful schemes to enable isolated execution environments supported by TrustZone to communicate between environments. However, it is already known that shared memory is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks since mechanisms to check integrity or authenticate callers for the shared memory payload are not supported in TrustZone. While an encryption-based method that resolves this limitation does exist, there are some architectural limitations. Indeed, even with key protection countermeasures applied, there is a risk that encryption keys may be leaked, as they are placed in insecure user memory during communication. Moreover, countermeasures for key leakage cause system performance overhead. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and secure scheme for shared memory, called Software One-Time Programmable Memory (SOTPM). SOTPM is a software-implemented, one-time programmable shared memory. It is based on the idea that payload encryption in the shared memory layer is unnecessary because sensitive data is already encrypted in the application layer before being written to the shared memory. SOTPM is set to read-only after data is written into SOTPM due to the one-time programmable characteristic. Therefore, attackers are unable to manipulate content in SOTPM during communication. Since it is not necessary for SOTPM to encrypt the payload in order to prevent malicious payload manipulation, it is possible to remove the risk of key leakage posed in previous studies. Additionally, in contrast with the existing method, our method can dramatically reduce system performance overhead. We implemented our prototype on an open-source hardware board with an Armv8-A processor and performed a security analysis and performance evaluation. The results show that SOTPM provides a sufficient level of security and less than 1% performance overhead, implying that SOTPM is a reasonable solution for current commercial products.

AB Purpose
   Existing wheelchair (WC) designs lack independent toilet accessibility, transferability and indoor manoeuvrability combined in a WC. In this regard, a new WC model is proposed to simultaneously accommodate these distinct and essential features. In this open-source hardware project, the design, analysis and fabrication of a new active commode WC for indoor applications are performed.
   Materials and method
   A field survey is conducted to identify the requirements of users so as to choose specific features and design constraints for the WC. In this multipurpose self-propelled model, a temporarily detachable circular section is fitted in the seat position to access the water closet bowl. This hinged portion can be released by gravity before reaching above the closet basin. After the toilet usage, the circular lid can be brought back to the initial seating using a lever mechanism and a spring-loaded lock restrains its downward movement. Thereafter, it can be used as an ordinary WC for indoor applications. Moreover, a small wheel with 22 in diameter and removable hand-rests ensured the transferability between utilities. A CAD model is prepared and numerical simulation is performed to verify the structural stability of the design.
   Results
   The optimized model is fabricated using standard manufacturing practices and is delivered to different persons with disabilities to collect user feedback. A systematic skill test is conducted to validate the compliance of the prototype with the user requirements including transferability and independent restroom access.
   Conclusion
   The opinions from most of the users are positive which categorically indicated that the proposed design addresses the multipurpose mobility requirements at indoors.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has seen a surge in development of Open Source Hardware, especially open source ventilators. Many of these open source ventilator projects have adopted an open-when-finished model due to legitimate legal and liability concerns. This, however, has led to a proliferation of projects with teams across the world independently designing over a hundred mutually incompatible ventilators, representing a huge amount of duplicated effort. A functioning design is necessary but not sufficient for a project to help patients. The device must be taken through regulatory approval by a manufacturer that understands why design decisions were taken. In this article we argue that the open design process developed for Open Source Software can be used for Open Source Hardware. This process not only allows remote teams to work together improving a single design, it also provides the rich history of design decisions that manufacturers need to take the device through regulatory approval.

AB In this study, the authors consider the problem of exchanging secrete messages in cyber-physical systems (CPSs) without resorting to cryptographic solutions. In particular, they consider a CPS where the networked controller wants to send a secrete message to the plant. They show that such a problem can be solved by exploiting a Wyner wiretap-like encoding scheme taking advantage of the closed-loop operations typical of feedback control systems. Specifically, by resorting to the control concept of one-step reachable sets, they first show that a wiretap-like encoding scheme exists whenever there is an asymmetry in the plant model knowledge available to control system (the defender) and to the eavesdropper. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is confirmed by means of a numerical example. Finally, they conclude the study by presenting open design challenges that can be addressed by the research community to improve, in different directions, the secrete message exchange problem in CPSs.

AB In recent years, some official reports, to produce best products regarding quality, quantity and economic conditions, recommend that the farming sector should benefit with new tools and techniques coming from Information and Communications Technology (ICT) realm. In this way, during last decade the deployment of sensing devices has increased considerably in the field of agriculture. This fact has led to a new concept called smart agriculture, and it contemplates activities such as field monitoring, which offer support to make decisions or perform actions, such as irrigation or fertilization.
   Apart from sensing devices, which use the Internet protocol to transfer data (Internet of Things), there are the so-called crop models, which are able to provide added value over the data provided by the sensors, with the aim of providing recommendations to farmers in decision-making and thus, increase the quality and quantity of their production.
   In this scenario, the current work uses a low-cost sensorized platform, capable of monitoring meteorological phenomena following the Internet of Things paradigm, with the goal to apply an alert disease model on the cultivation of the vine. The edge computing paradigm is used to achieve this objective; also our work follows some advances from GIScience to increase interoperability. An example of this platform has been deployed in a vineyard parcel located in the municipality of Vilafames (Castello, Spain). (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The FloripaSat-I project consists of an initiative from the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC), in Brazil, to train students to design, test and integrate innovative space systems. The group just developed its first open-source CubeSat, the FloripaSat-I, which aims to empower students to develop space systems through a practical approach, where they have full control of the design and test of a real spacecraft. The project has already gone through all the stages of a CubeSat mission prior to the launching and operation stages. A prototype of the satellite, as well the engineering models 1 and 2 (EM-I and EM-II) were built. The expertise provided by the engineering models allows the development of a functional flight model (FM). This paper presents the validation and qualification tests that pass various FloripaSat-I models, from the engineering model to the flight model. All stages of the project are described, the tests performed in each phase, as well as the lessons learned. Thus, this paper serves as a guidance for other university teams that want to test their own CubeSats, as well as teams that want to use the open-source hardware and software left as heritage by this project.

AB Inadequate weather conditions are one of the main threats to the correct development of sensitive crops, where a bad situation can lead to greater stress on plants and their weakness against various diseases. This statement is especially decisive in the cultivation of the vineyard. Meteorological monitoring of vineyard parcels is vital to detect and prevent possible fungal diseases. The development of new Information and Communication Technologies, linked to the Smart Farming movement, together with the reduced cost of electronic components, have favoured a greater availability of meteorological monitoring stations to get to know first-class hand the state of the vineyard smallholdings. This work provides a set of over 750,000 environmental raw data records collected by low-cost Internet of Things nodes, primarily located within vineyard smallholdings. The published observations were collected between 2018-04-01 and 2018-10-31 and were validated in previous research to determine the data's reliability. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

ID RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT
AB The blade wrap angle of impeller is an important structural parameter in the hydraulic design of open-design vortex pump. In this paper, taking a vortex pump with a cylindrical blade structure as the research object, two kinds of different blade wrap angle of vortex pump impellers are designed. The experiment and numerical simulation research is carried out, and the results of external characteristics and internal flow field are obtained under different flow rate. The results show that when ensuring that other main structural parameters remain unchanged, the efficiency and head of open-design vortex pump increase with the blade wrap angle decreases. In the case of blade wrap angle increasing, the length of rotating reflux back from lateral cavity to inlet is longer. For the same type of vortex pump, the length of rotating reflux to inlet decreases with the increase of flow rate. At the inlet area of impeller front face, there is an area where liquid flows back to the lateral cavity. The volute section shows that after passing through the impeller and lateral cavity, the liquid is discharged to the pump outlet with strong spiral strength. It is found that the blade wrap angle decreases and the shaft power increases, while the pump efficiency increases. The impeller blade wrap angle of vortex pump can be considered to select a smaller value.

AB Although the cure for the SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) will come in the form of pharmaceutical solutions and/or a vaccine, one of the only ways to face it at present is to guarantee the best quality of health for patients, so that they can overcome the disease on their own. Therefore, and considering that COVID-19 generally causes damage to the respiratory system (in the form of lung infection), it is essential to ensure the best pulmonary ventilation for the patient. However, depending on the severity of the disease and the health condition of the patient, the situation can become critical when the patient has respiratory distress or becomes unable to breathe on his/her own. In that case, the ventilator becomes the lifeline of the patient. This device must keep patients stable until, on their own or with the help of medications, they manage to overcome the lung infection. However, with thousands or hundreds of thousands of infected patients, no country has enough ventilators. If this situation has become critical in the Global North, it has turned disastrous in developing countries, where ventilators are even more scarce. This article shows the race against time of a multidisciplinary research team at the University of Huelva, UHU, southwest of Spain, to develop an inexpensive, multifunctional, and easy-to-manufacture ventilator, which has been named ResUHUrge. The device meets all medical requirements and is developed with open-source hardware and software.

TI Hyperspectral super-resolution imaging with far-red emitting

SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS

ID OPTICAL RECONSTRUCTION MICROSCOPY; MEMBRANE; PROTEINS; STORM
AB New innovations in single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) have revolutionized optical imaging, enabling the characterization of biological structures and interactions with unprecedented detail and resolution. However, multi-color or hyperspectral SMLM can pose particular challenges which affect image quality and data interpretation, such as unequal photophysical performance of fluorophores and non-linear image registration issues, which arise as two emission channels travel along different optical paths to reach the detector. In addition, using evanescent-wave based approaches (Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence: TIRF) where beam shape, decay depth, and power density are important, different illumination wavelengths can lead to unequal imaging depth across multiple channels on the same sample. A potential useful approach would be to use a single excitation wavelength to perform hyperspectral localization imaging. We report herein on the use of a variable angle tunable thin-film filter to spectrally isolate far-red emitting fluorophores. This solution was integrated into a commercial microscope platform using an open-source hardware design, enabling the rapid acquisition of SMLM images arising from fluorescence emission captured within similar to 15 nm to 20 nm spectral windows (or detection bands). By characterizing intensity distributions, average intensities, and localization frequency through a range of spectral windows, we investigated several far-red emitting fluorophores and identified an optimal fluorophore pair for two-color SMLM using this method. Fluorophore crosstalk between the different spectral windows was assessed by examining the effect of varying the photon output thresholds on the localization frequency and fraction of data recovered. The utility of this approach was demonstrated by hyper-spectral super-resolution imaging of the interaction between the mitochondrial protein, TOM20, and the peroxisomal protein, PMP70.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS

DT Review; Early Access
DE Coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2; Infectious agent; Feces; Sanitary; Hygiene
AB The novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 has infected over 46 million people in 219 countries and territories. Following evidence of viral loadings and infectivity of feces of infected individuals, public health authorities have suggested to take precautions on the transmission of COVID-19 via fecal-associated routes. Recent discussions on fecal transmission of COVID-19 have mainly focused on municipal sewage. Yet, a widely neglected aspect in containing the virus is that a major part of the population in developing regions do not have access to private, clean sanitary facilities. Therefore, we hypothesize that open defecation and the prevalent use of squat toilets are additional risk factors in those communities. Here, we review fecal transmission of COVID-19, the practices of open defecation, and the resultant routes of transmission of fecal pathogens. Also, we highlight the open design of common squat toilets and the potential exposure to fecal droplets and residues. We observed that at least 20 countries reporting more than 10,000 confirmed infections have 5-26% of their population practicing open defecation. We illustrate the potential routes of transmission of COVID-19 and other fecal pathogens via human feces in communities practicing open defecation. Here, poor hand hygiene, contaminated shoes and objects, mechanical vectors, and outdoor human activities can all contribute to fecal transmission. Other risk factors include squat pans with lidless designs and open flushing mechanisms, in-cubicle open waste bins, and the lack of water-sealing U-traps in squat toilets.

AB This paper presents a fuzzy inference system and microcontroller-based protection scheme for a combined underground (UG) cable and overhead (OH) transmission line system. The scheme detects, classifies, and locates the fault occurring either in an UG cable or OH transmission line network. Furthermore, the scheme identifies the faulty section. An existing Indian power network i.e., real power system network of C.G. state, consisting of 132 kV, 50 Hz power transmission network connecting Doma substation 220/132 kV to the 132/33 kV Gas Insulated Substation Rawanbhata through combined transmission network is considered. This real power transmission network is simulated by using MATLAB/Simulink software. In this paper, the hardware implementation is also carried out using an open-source hardware, Arduino, which consists of an Atmel 8-bit AVR microcontroller. Both the simulation and hardware results validate that the proposed scheme is accurately detecting, classifying, and locating the fault in less than a half cycle time. Moreover, the percentage error in determining the location of a fault is less than 0.7%.

TI Estimation of US Children's Educational Attainment and Years of Life
   Lost Associated With Primary School Closures During the Coronavirus
   Disease 2019 Pandemic
SO JAMA NETWORK OPEN
LA English
DT Article
ID STRIKES; MORTALITY
AB This decision analytical model estimates the potential years of life lost among US primary school-aged children associated with school closures during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.
   Importance United States primary school closures during the 2020 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic affected millions of children, with little understanding of the potential health outcomes associated with educational disruption. Objective To estimate the potential years of life lost (YLL) associated with the COVID-19 pandemic conditioned on primary schools being closed or remaining open. Design, Setting, and Participants This decision analytical model estimated the association between school closures and reduced educational attainment and the association between reduced educational attainment and life expectancy using publicly available data sources, including data for 2020 from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US Social Security Administration, and the US Census Bureau. Direct COVID-19 mortality and potential increases in mortality that might have resulted if school opening led to increased transmission of COVID-19 were also estimated. Main Outcomes and Measures Years of life lost. Results A total of 24.2 million children aged 5 to 11 years attended public schools that were closed during the 2020 pandemic, losing a median of 54 (interquartile range, 48-62.5) days of instruction. Missed instruction was associated with a mean loss of 0.31 (95% credible interval [CI], 0.10-0.65) years of final educational attainment for boys and 0.21 (95% CI, 0.06-0.46) years for girls. Summed across the population, an estimated 5.53 million (95% CI, 1.88-10.80) YLL may be associated with school closures. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a total of 88241 US deaths from COVID-19 through the end of May 2020, with an estimated 1.50 million (95% CI, 1.23-1.85 million) YLL as a result. Had schools remained open, 1.47 million (95% credible interval, 0.45-2.59) additional YLL could have been expected as a result, based on results of studies associating school closure with decreased pandemic spread. Comparing the full distributions of estimated YLL under both "schools open" and "schools closed" conditions, the analysis observed a 98.1% probability that school opening would have been associated with a lower total YLL than school closure. Conclusions and Relevance In this decision analytical model of years of life potentially lost under differing conditions of school closure, the analysis favored schools remaining open. Future decisions regarding school closures during the pandemic should consider the association between educational disruption and decreased expected lifespan and give greater weight to the potential outcomes of school closure on children's health.
   Question Based on the current understanding of the associations between school disruption and decreased educational attainment and between decreased educational attainment and lower life expectancy, is it possible to estimate the association between school closure during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and decreased life expectancy of publicly educated primary school-aged children in the United States? Findings This decision analytical model found that missed instruction during 2020 could be associated with an estimated 5.53 million years of life lost. This loss in life expectancy was likely to be greater than would have been observed if leaving primary schools open had led to an expansion of the first wave of the pandemic. Meaning These findings suggest that the decision to close US public primary schools in the early months of 2020 may be associated with a decrease in life expectancy for US children.

AB Single-molecule Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) is a powerful technique capable of resolving both relative and absolute distances within and between structurally dynamic biomolecules. High instrument costs, and a lack of open-source hardware and acquisition software have limited smFRET's broad application by non-specialists. Here, we present the smfBox, a cost-effective confocal smFRET platform, providing detailed build instructions, open-source acquisition software, and full validation, thereby democratising smFRET for the wider scientific community. Broad uptake of smFRET has been hindered by high instrument costs and a lack of open-source hardware and acquisition software. Here, the authors present the smfBox, a cost-effective open-source platform capable of measuring precise FRET efficiencies between dyes on freely diffusing single molecules.

TI Easy to build low-power GPS drifters with local storage and a cellular
   modem made from off-the-shelf components
SO GEOSCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTATION METHODS AND DATA SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB Drifters that track their position are important tools in studying the hydrodynamic behavior of rivers. Drifters that can be tracked in real time have so far been rather expensive. Recently, due to the rise of the open-hardware revolution and the associated Arduino ecosystem, both GPS receivers and cellular modems have become available at lower prices to "tinkering scientists", i.e., scientists that like to build their own measurement devices as much as is possible. This article serves two goals. Firstly, we provide detailed instructions on how to build a low-power GPS drifter with local storage and cellular model that we tested in a fieldwork on the confluence of the Chindwin and Ayeyarwady rivers in Myanmar. The device was designed from easily connected off-the-shelf components, allowing construction without a background in electrical engineering. The instructions allow fellow geoscientists to recreate the device. Secondly, we set the following question: has the open-hardware revolution progressed to the point that a low-power GPS drifter that wirelessly transmits its position can be made from open-hardware components by most geoscientists?. We feel this question is relevant and timely as more low-cost open-hardware devices are promoted, but in practice applicability is often restricted to the "tinkering engineer". We argue that because of the plug-and-play nature of the components geoscientists should be able to construct these type of devices. However, to get such devices to operate at low power levels that fieldwork often demands requires detailed (micro)electrical expertise.

AB The importance of monitoring the pressures in the water supply system combined with the high costal implementation and maintenance of devices capable of this, corroborated the objective of this study. Therefore, we seek to develop low-cost equipment to measure water pressure. For this, 15 MPR dataloggers were produced, costing R$ 20815 each, calibrated with a commercial equipment. The equipment were installed in residences with different consumptions profiles and altitudes in the municipality of Lucas do Rio Verde, Mato Grosso, for 43 days. The results obtained were satisfied, promising, and showed that the equipment is robust and precise with a R-2 of 0.9986 when compared with the commercial equipment, in addition to being possible to evaluate the city's supply system and the necessary interventions.

AB Microencapsulation is a widely studied cell therapy and tissue bioengineering technique, since it is capable of creating an immune-privileged site, protecting encapsulated cells from the host immune system. Several polymers have been tested, but sodium alginate is in widespread use for cell encapsulation applications, due to its low toxicity and easy manipulation. Different cell encapsulation methods have been described in the literature using pressure differences or electrostatic changes with high cost commercial devices (about 30,000 US dollars). Herein, a low-cost device (about 100 US dollars) that can be created by commercial syringes or 3D printer devices has been developed. The capsules, whose diameter is around 500 mu m and can decrease or increase according to the pressure applied to the system, is able to maintain cells viable and functional. The hydrogel porosity of the capsule indicates that the immune system is not capable of destroying host cells, demonstrating that new studies can be developed for cell therapy at low cost with microencapsulation production. This device may aid pre-clinical and clinical projects in low- and middle-income countries and is lined up with open source equipment devices.

AB In this paper, a modular and open micro X-ray Computed Tomography (mu XRCT) system is presented, which was set up during the last years at the Institute of Applied Mechanics (CE) of the University of Stuttgart and earlier at the Institute of Computational Engineering of Ruhr-University Bochum. The system is characterized by its intrinsic flexibility resulting from the modular and open design on each level and the opportunity to implement advanced experimental in situ setups. On the one hand, the presented work is intended to support researchers interested in setting up an experimental XRCT system for the microstructural characterization of materials. On the other hand, it aims to support scientists confronted with the decision to set up a system on their own or to buy a commercial scanner. In addition to the presentation of the various hardware components and the applied modular software concept, the technical opportunities of the open and modular hard- and software design are demonstrated by implementing a simple and reliable method for the compensation of bad detector pixels to enhance the raw data quality of the projections. A detailed investigation of the performance of the presented system with regard to the achievable spatial resolution is presented. XRCT datasets of three different applications are finally shown and discussed, demonstrating the wide scope of options of the presented system.

AB Multispectral imaging (MI) techniques are being used very often to identify different properties of nature in several domains, going from precision agriculture to environmental studies, not to mention quality inspection of pharmaceutical production, art restoration, biochemistry, forensic sciences or geology, just to name some. Different implementations are commercially available from the industry and yet there is quite an interest from the scientific community to spread its use to the majority of society by means of cost effectiveness and ease of use for solutions. These devices make the most sense when combined with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), going a step further and alleviating repetitive routines which could be strenuous if traditional methods were adopted. In this work, a low cost and modular solution for a multispectral camera is presented, based on the use of a single panchromatic complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensor combined with a rotating wheel of interchangeable band pass optic filters. The system is compatible with open source hardware permitting one to capture, process, store and/or transmit data if needed. In addition, a calibration and characterization methodology has been developed for the camera, allowing not only for quantifying its performance, but also able to characterize other CMOS sensors in the market in order to select the one that best suits the budget and application. The process was experimentally validated by mounting the camera in a Dji Matrice 600 UAV to uncover vegetation indices in a reduced area of palm trees plantation. Results are presented for the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) showing a generated colored map with the captured information.

AB Precision aquaculture is a new field that allows farmers to have better control over aquaculture processes, facilitating decision-making and improving efficiency. The implementation and evaluation of a low-cost water-quality monitoring system based on open-source hardware, which is easy to rebuild for scientific applications, is reported in this paper. The proposed system measures temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH, taking records and sending information through a wireless protocol (ZigBee) to a graphical user interface which can display information numerically and graphically, as well as simultaneously storing the information in a database. These variables are very important for aquaculture, as they have a direct influence on critical culture parameters such as growth and survival. Although it is a low-cost system, it offers good quality data and demonstrates efficiency for its use in precision aquaculture.

AB Servo systems are feedback control systems characterized by position, speed, and/or acceleration outputs. Nowadays, industrial advances make the electronic stages in these systems obsolete compared to the mechanical elements, which generates a recurring problem in technological, commercial and industrial applications. This article presents a methodology for the development of an open-architecture controller that is based on reconfigurable hardware under the open source concept for servo applications. The most outstanding contribution of this paper is the implementation of a Genetic Algorithm for online self tuning with a focus on both high-quality servo control and reduction of vibrations during the positioning of a linear motion system. The proposed techniques have been validated on a real platform and form a novel, effective approach as compared to the conventional tuning methods that employ empirical or analytical solutions and cannot improve their parameter set. The controller was elaborated from the Graphical User Interface to the logical implementation while using free tools. This approach also allows for modification and updates to be made easily, thereby reducing the susceptibility to obsolescence. A comparison of the logical implementation with the manufacturer software was also conducted in order to test the performance of free tools in FPGAs. The Graphical User Interface developed in Python presents features, such as speed profiling, controller auto-tuning, measurement of main parameters, and monitoring of servo system vibrations.

AB The measurement of RNA abundance derived from massively parallel sequencing experiments is an essential technique. Methods that reduce ribosomal RNA levels are usually required prior to sequencing library construction because ribosomal RNA typically comprises the vast majority of a total RNA sample. For some experiments, ribosomal RNA depletion is favored over poly(A) selection because it offers a more inclusive representation of the transcriptome. However, methods to deplete ribosomal RNA are generally proprietary, complex, inefficient, applicable to only specific species, or compatible with only a narrow range of RNA input levels. Here, we describe Ribo-Pop (ribosomal RNA depletion for popular use), a simple workflow and antisense oligo design strategy that we demonstrate works over a wide input range and can be easily adapted to any organism with a sequenced genome. We provide a computational pipeline for probe selection, a streamlined 20-min protocol, and ready-to-use oligo sequences for several organisms. We anticipate that our simple and generalizable "open source" design strategy would enable virtually any laboratory to pursue full transcriptome sequencing in their organism of interest with minimal time and resource investment.

AB Affordable and readily available microelectronics are becoming prevalent in teaching laboratories however these useful and economic tools are not used widely in either academia or industry. Herein we report how a metal organic framework (MOF) synthetic route can be optimized using an in situ monitoring apparatus designed in-house on open source hardware for under $100. We demonstrate that the MOF can be produced at atmospheric pressure, an improvement over previous reports, but also with a reduction in reaction time of 93%. This improvement in reaction time was predicted after a single experiment using the monitoring kit showing how efficiencies in the lab can be gained with very little experimental and monetary overhead while minimising the resources used.

AB Emerged at the intersection of open-source, do-it-yourself and maker movements, and blurring of the lines among users, designers and producers, open design suggests a continuous process of co-designing open to everyone and demonstrates opportunities for repair, reuse and upgrading through transparent processes and design sharing. While such opportunities are conceptualized in literature, how they can (or should) be reflected in design is an open question worth exploring. This paper presents an exploratory study on product/part longevity, personalization and reuse to find out the implications of open design for transforming an already established product category like small kitchen appliances. For this purpose, research through co-designing methodology was developed and utilized through two design workshops on practices shaped around small kitchen appliances. The study revealed sustainable design considerations for idea-generation, open part properties that respond to them, the strategies for iterating open designs and their implications for product/part longevity, personalization and reuse.

AB The development of lab-on-a-chip technology and its applications in biochemical and biomedical analyses has, during the last two decades, led to the potential realisation of portable and on-site detection devices, the so-called point-of-care (PoC) detection systems. These are essentially cheap, easy-to-handle systems, offering rapid sample-to-answer results to non-technical operators. In this perspective, we do not review all the current advances of Lab-on-a-chip techniques for the realisation of PoC. Instead, we aim to provide insight into what we foresee as the three most important factors to play the essential roles for succeeding in making commercially viable PoC pathogen-detection devices. The three insights are namely: the utilizations of (i) disposable polymer (microfluidic) chips, (ii) the implementation of surface-bound (or solid-phase) nucleic-acid amplification techniques and (iii) relying (more) on open-source hardware and software.

   The customizable clip system opens new possibilities for occupational health professionals since the basic design can be altered to hold different kinds of samplers and tools. The solution is shared using an open source methodology to allow for distributed manufacturing of the free designs.
   Design for additive manufacturing is adopted to help solve problems inherent to attaching active personal sampler systems to workers for monitoring their breathing zone. A novel and parametric 3D printable clip system was designed with an open source Computer-aided design (CAD) system and was additively manufactured. The concept was first tested with a simple clip design, and when it was found to be functional, the ability of the innovative and open source design to be extended to other applications was demonstrated by designing another tooling system. The clip system was tested for mechanical stress test to establish a minimum lifetime of 5000 openings, a cleaning test, and a supply chain test. The designs were also tested three times in field conditions. The design cost and functionalities of the clip system were compared to commercial systems. This study presents an innovative custom-designed clip system that can aid in attaching different tools for personal exposure measurement to a worker's harness without hindering the operation of the worker. The customizable clip system opens new possibilities for occupational health professionals since the basic design can be altered to hold different kinds of samplers and tools. The solution is shared using an open source methodology.

AB Relevant to mobile health, the design of a portable electrocardiograph (ECG) device using AD823X microchips as the analog front-end is presented. Starting with the evaluation board of the chip, open-source hardware and software components were integrated into a breadboard prototype. This required modifying the microchip with the breadboard-friendly Arduino Nano board in addition to a data logger and a Bluetooth breakout board. The digitized ECG signal can be transmitted by serial cable, via Bluetooth to a PC, or to an Android smartphone system for visualization. The data logging shield provides gigabytes of storage, as the signal is recorded to a microSD card adapter. A menu incorporates the device's several operating modes. Simulation and testing assessed the system stability and performance parameters in terms of not losing any sample data throughout the length of the recording and finding the maximum sampling frequency; and validation determined and resolved problems that arose in open-source development. Ultimately, a custom printed circuit board was produced requiring advanced manufacturing options of 2.5 mils trace widths for the small package components. The fabricated device did not degrade the AD823X noise performance, and an ECG waveform with negligible distortion was obtained. The maximum number of samples/second was 2380 Hz in serial cable transmission, whereas in microSD recording mode, a continuous ECG signal for up to 36 h at 500 Hz was verified. A low-cost, high-quality portable ECG for long-term monitoring prototype that reasonably complies with electrical safety regulations and medical equipment design was realized.

AB Hydrocarbon contamination plagues high-resolution and analytical electron microscopy by depositing carbonaceous layers onto surfaces during electron irradiation, which can render carefully prepared specimens useless. Increased specimen thickness degrades resolution with beam broadening alongside loss of contrast. The large inelastic cross-section of carbon hampers accurate atomic species detection. Oxygen and water molecules pose problems of lattice damage by chemically etching the specimen during imaging. These constraints on high-resolution and spectroscopic imaging demand clean, high-vacuum microscopes with dry pumps. Here, we present an open-hardware design of a high-vacuum manifold for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) holders to mitigate hydrocarbon and residual species exposure. We quantitatively show that TEM holders are inherently dirty and introduce a range of unwanted chemical species. Overnight storage in our manifold reduces contaminants by one to two orders of magnitude and promotes two to four times faster vacuum recovery. A built-in bakeout system further reduces contaminants partial pressure to below 10(-10 )hPa (Torr) (approximately four orders of magnitude down from ambient storage) and alleviates monolayer adsorption during a typical TEM experiment. We determine that bakeout of TEM holder with specimen held therein is the optimal cleaning method. Our high-vacuum manifold design is published with open-source blueprints, parts, and cost list.

AB Despite advances in measuring fluid viscosity, we still lack portable viscometers to analyze shear ratevarying fluid characteristics in the form of open-source hardware that non-expert users can easily make and use. We present a hand-held, automatic capillary viscometer, termed Viscopette which can be fabricated simply by assembling globally available mechanical (a stepper motor and an inline pressure sensor), fluidic (a positive-displacement pipette and a cut tubing piece), electronic (an Arduino board) parts in a 3D-printed housing. The Viscopette is specifically designed to improve user experience by adopting how to use commercial micropipettes, and fits within 7.3 cm x 7.3 cm x 38.8 cm (without the cut tubing piece) with an overall weight of 437 g for portable use. By exploiting the high level of controllability of the open-source microcontroller, the Viscopettes enables time-varying shear-rate (or flow-rate) control for viscosity analysis, and simple viscosity measurement by calculating the ratio of a pressure value measured using the inline pressure sensor and a set flow-rate condition. With the advantages of easeof-use, portability, and shear-rate controllability, we demonstrate the Viscopette's ability to accurately analyze Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. Our method addresses the unmet need in portable, highperformance viscometers suitable for use as an open-source equipment, which can facilitate on-site, accurate viscosity analysis even by non-expert users.

AB Taiwan is an aging society, but the appropriate designs must be considered in senior care spaces. Universal design knowledge has been addressed in universities, but students cannot imagine how age affects the needs of senior citizens physically and psychologically. The teaching practice in this study adopted a dyadic teaching method whereby students observed the needs of individuals in a nursing care center for elderly people. It also used cooperative learning methods for nursing students to discuss the needs of senior citizens and to help design students understand the lifestyles of senior citizens through the use of simulation devices. Through the feedback from the learning process, statistical analysis was used to assess the learning performance of students. The design studio used these two teaching methods, and the respective work was entered into an open design competition to verify whether teaching performance was successful. Approximately 70% of the works earned design awards. This provided a preliminary validation of the success of the respective teaching practice method.

AB Repeat observations underpin our understanding of environmental processes, but financial constraints often limit scientists' ability to deploy dense networks of conventional commercial instrumentation. Rapid growth in the Internet-Of-Things (IoT) and the maker movement is paving the way for low-cost electronic sensors to transform global environmental monitoring. Accessible and inexpensive sensor construction is also fostering exciting opportunities for citizen science and participatory research. Drawing on 6 years of developmental work with Arduino-based open-source hardware and software, extensive laboratory and field testing, and incorporation of such technology into active research programmes, we outline a series of successes, failures and lessons learned in designing and deploying environmental sensors. Six case studies are presented: a water table depth probe, air and water quality sensors, multi-parameter weather stations, a time-sequencing lake sediment trap, and a sonic anemometer for monitoring sand transport. Schematics, code and purchasing guidance to reproduce our sensors are described in the paper, with detailed build instructions hosted on our King's College London Geography Environmental Sensors Github repository and the FreeStation project website. We show in each case study that manual design and construction can produce research-grade scientific instrumentation (mean bias error for calibrated sensors -0.04 to 23%) for a fraction of the conventional cost, provided rigorous, sensor-specific calibration and field testing is conducted. In sharing our collective experiences with build-it-yourself environmental monitoring, we intend for this paper to act as a catalyst for physical geographers and the wider environmental science community to begin incorporating low-cost sensor development into their research activities. The capacity to deploy denser sensor networks should ultimately lead to superior environmental monitoring at the local to global scales.

AB A CE instrument that can be assembled from commercially available components with minimal construction effort is described. Except for the electronic control circuitry no specially made parts are required. It is based on a flexible design of microfluidic, electropneumatic, and electronic sections and different configurations can easily be implemented. Automated injection into the capillary is performed hydrodynamically by the application of a pressure for a controlled length of time. The performance of the device was tested with a contactless conductivity detector by separating different metal ions. In addition, nine metal cations related to the quality of honey were separated in 2.3 min and four honey samples were analysed quantitatively to demonstrate the applicability of the method.

SO GEOSCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTATION METHODS AND DATA SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB The commercial data acquisition instruments designed for three-component microtremor measurements are usually very expensive devices. In this paper, a low-cost, computer-aided, and geophone-based system designed to record, monitor, and analyze three-component microtremor data is presented. This proposed system is not a simple data acquisition system. It is also an integrated system developed to interpret the microtremor data using the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (H/V) method without any external software. Therefore, the H/V peak frequency and amplitude can be easily estimated using this system. The proposed system has several features such as a 200 Hz sampling frequency, approximately 72 dB dynamic range, text data format, and data analysis tools. This system consists of a graphical user interface developed by using the .NET Framework 4.5.2 and external hardware that includes signal conditioning circuits, voltage converter circuit, external analog-to-digital converter, and Arduino Uno board. The proposed system uses low-cost vertical and horizontal geophones with a 4.5 Hz natural frequency to measure three-component microtremor data. The developed software undertakes many tasks such as communication between the external hardware and computer, transferring, monitoring, and recording the seismic data to the computer, and interpretation of the recorded data using the Nakamura method. Channel consistency and internal noise measurement tests were performed to demonstrate the accuracy and precision of the proposed system. The proposed system was compared to a commercial triaxial digital seismograph, and satisfactory results were obtained. The developed system is a completely open-source and open-hardware system and can be easily used in academic studies conducted by researchers and university students who are interested in seismic ambient noise analysis.

ID DANIO-RERIO; HUSBANDRY; MODEL
AB Recently, the zebrafish has gained in popularity as a vertebrate animal model for biomedical research. Commercial zebrafish housing systems are available and are designed to maximize stocking density of fish for a given space, but these systems are expensive and purchasing them may not be feasible for emerging laboratories with limited funding. In this article, we describe the construction of a simple and affordable recirculating zebrafish housing system. This system can be constructed in 3 working days, with materials readily available in hardware stores. The cost for construction of the system was only 3,000 MYR (750 USD). The system consists of a water reservoir, a supply line that delivers water to the shelves holding the zebrafish tanks, and a drainage line that receives water from both the supply line and the shelves containing the fish tanks and returns this water to the reservoir. This system also has a 3-stage filtration process to ensure that clean water is delivered to the zebrafish tank. The system can house up to 360 zebrafish. This low-cost housing system may make research using zebrafish feasible some laboratories.

DE Homeothermic; Modeling; Open Hardware
AB This work presents an experimental activity developed in a teacher training course in natural sciences. In the activity, a physical phenomenon present in the homeothermic animals was modeled, consisting of the greater exposure to heat transfer in young animals compared to adult specimens of the same species. This thermal situation has important consequences for animal behavior. The explanation is based on the fact that the relationship between the body area of the small animal and that of the adult, gives a greater value than the relationship between the respective volumes. Representative aluminum pieces are used to model the phenomenon, and open hardware is used to perform the temperature measurements in a calorimetry experiment. The construction of the necessary elements to develop it is detailed.

DE in situ sensor; open-source hardware; underwater imaging; zooplankton
AB Zooplankton play vital ecological roles that maintain aquatic ecosystems. Imaging instruments have enabled in situ observations of these organisms that can be automated and are less invasive than traditional sampling methods. However, these instruments are often costly and require sophisticated engineering expertise to operate. The In situ Plankton Assemblage eXplorer (IPAX) is an open-source low-cost imaging platform for zooplankton studies. The IPAX is a programmable instrument that has powerful LED illumination and a high-resolution camera that can image zooplankton in situ, while material costs are less than USD $450. The optical performance of the instrument was calibrated in the laboratory using a calibration target and preserved zooplankton. The IPAX was then deployed in the field to observe diversity, emergent patterns and phototactic behaviour of demersal zooplankton at night to demonstrate its practicality. Laboratory calibration indicated that the IPAX can resolve 100 mu m features with 70% contrast at the focal plane with 5 cm x 3 cm field of view and 5 mm depth of field. The instrument also resolved fine morphological details of preserved zooplankton when in focus. The field deployment demonstrated capability to resolve the myriad of zooplankton present in addition to the different phototactic behaviour that was elicited and observed from the different colour LEDs. The IPAX enables economical and autonomous surveys of zooplankton in various aquatic habitats. Its low cost facilitates construction and deployment of multiple units that can cover large spatial areas, while its versatility also allows adaptations to many experimental needs for aquatic ecology.

AB Objective: Evaluate the clinical utility of combinatorial pharmacogenomic testing for informing medication selection among older adults who have experienced antidepressant medication failure for major depressive disorder (MDD). Design: Post hoc analysis of data from a blinded, randomized controlled trial comparing two active treatment arms. Setting: Psychiatry specialty and primary care clinics across 60 U.S. community and academic sites. Participants: Adults age 65 years or older at baseline (n = 206), diagnosed with MDD and inadequate response to at least one medication on the combinatorial pharmacogenomic test report during the current depressive episode. Intervention: Combinatorial pharmacogenomic testing to inform medication selection (guided-care), compared with treatment as usual (TAU). Outcomes: Mean percent symptom improvement, response rate, and remission rateat week 8, measured using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; medication switching; and comorbidity moderator analysis. Results: At week 8, symptom improvement was not significantly different for guided-care than for TAU (Delta = 8.1%, t = 1.64, df = 187; p = 0.102); however, guided-care showed significantly improved response (Delta = 13.6%, t = 2.16, df = 187; p = 0.032) and remission (Delta = 12.7%, t = 2.49, df = 189; p = 0.014) relative to TAU. By week 8, more than twice as many patients in guided-care than in TAU were on medications predicted to have no gene-drug interactions (chi(2) = 19.3, df = 2; p <0.001). Outcomes in the guided-care arm showed consistent improvement through the end of the open-design 24-week trial, indicating durability of the effect. Differences in outcomes between arms were not significantly impacted by comorbidities. Conclusions: Combinatorial pharmacogenomic test-informed medication selection improved outcomes over TAU among older adults with depression.

AB Recent developments in information and communication technology have caused a major impact on training and production techniques.The concept of virtual instrument has led to the application of new techniques in the area of measurement and production systems design.Virtual instruments have begun to replace the expensive and complex instruments that are the main part of real laboratories.Thus, the process of designing, realizing and modernizing laboratories has been facilitated. Today, developments in NdFeb magnets have caused these magnets to become essential elements in many technology fields. NdFeB magnets are widely used in the engines of hybrid electric vehicles due to the maximum energy product (BHmax). In addition, usage of NdFeB in applications such as magnetic resonance imaging, electric motors, various generators and in large-scale or small-scale wind energy generators have increased significantly. In this study, before the production of NdFeB magnets, a virtual laboratory platform which can be used in research and development studies and production is realized.The developed virtual platform is designed and run as a desktop application. In future studies, web based applications will be developed by using open source hardware.In the study, mathematical functions were obtained from data related to B-r(permanent magnetism), H-c(magnetic coercivity), BHmax, and Curie temperature obtained in researches on different NdFeB alloys in real laboratory.The virtual laboratory platform was prepared with the obtained functions. The laboratory system can be used in industry for multi-purpose. In addition, it also allows for use for educational purposes. It is aimed to save cost and time during the the research and development studies in magnet design and to perform different magnet works.

AB The separation of suspensions and immiscible liquids by the laboratory centrifuge is widely used in such fields as chemistry, biology, biochemistry, and clinical medicine. In this paper, an Arduino-based microcentrifuge was fabricated using a computer DVD (digital versatile disc) drive. The hardware part consisted of inexpensive mechanical and electronic parts such as the recycled parts of a computer DVD drive, an Arduino microcontroller, a motor driver, a magnetic sensor (for speed measurement), and a display. The microcentrifuge provided a wide speed range of 1,000-10,000 rpm. The fabrication process is easy, and the total fabrication cost of the fabricated microcentrifuge is less than $25. Since the fabricated microcentrifuge has open-source hardware and software parts, it is appropriate for educational purposes and laboratory settings.

ID SYSTEMS
AB Additive manufacturing (AM) is an important, rapidly emerging, manufacturing technology that takes the information from a computer-aided design (CAD) and builds parts in a layer-by-layer style. Thus, since the development of 3D printing, the fused deposition modeling (FDM) is one of the most promising and inexpensive techniques for shaping free-form parts. It used a thermoplastic filament as a starting material to extrude, layer by layer, the suitable 3D object. It is assisted by a large community of developers, searchers, and users and with multiple free hardware and software open sources expanding the scope of its applications. However, in this process, printing objects with multi-materials and multicolors becomes a major challenge for most extrusion system of printing platforms. For example, in case it is required to print multi-material and multicolored parts, a high-quality head extruder should be used. The main objective of this work is to show the importance of proposing a new extruder system of printing parts with multicolors and materials. For this purpose, in the present paper, the different extrusion systems capable of printing parts with multicolors and materials were presented. The operating principle of each extrusion system is well explained through functional diagrams. Then, its advantages and disadvantages are cited. Finally, some prospects for improving these systems are presented and that will be the work of the next paper.

AB Background Root-retained overdentures (OD) are one treatment option for partially edentulous patients. However, the available evidence regarding factors influencing abutment survival in root-retained ODs is limited. Purpose This retrospective study included clinical examinations and evaluated the survival rate of roots restored with precision attachments soldered to post-and-core (gold cap) retained ODs, analysed with respect to various patient- and prosthesis-related factors. Methods Patients receiving at least one OD with gold caps in the past were invited for comprehensive clinical examinations. The primary outcome parameter was the abutment survival rate over the observation period (2002-2016). Possible contributing factors (eg closed vs open OD design) were analysed. Analyses included Kaplan-Meier estimators, Cox regressions and hazard ratios (HR). Results 114 patients with 128 ODs originally retained by 280 abutments, with a cumulative total exposure time of 2035.4 years, were examined. Twenty-seven abutment teeth (9.6%) were lost after a mean observation period of 7.9 +/- 3.4 years. Significant factors associated with abutment loss were a closed, compared to an open OD design (HR 8.38 (95% CI 1.11-63.59),P = .040), which was independent of the number of abutments per OD. Furthermore, the loss rate was higher when the denture was not worn day-and-night (HR 3.52 (95% CI 1.32-9.40),P = .012). Oral hygiene behaviour was associated with higher HRs. Conclusions ODs remain a viable treatment option for patients with few teeth remaining in the dental arch. It is advisable to choose an open design for the OD, irrespective of the number of abutment teeth. Furthermore, gold cap-retained ODs should not be removed overnight.

ID RESOLUTION; SPECIMEN; ROTATION; TOOL
AB Optical projection tomography (OPT) is a 3D imaging alternative to conventional microscopy which allows imaging of millimeter-sized object with isotropic micrometer resolution. The zebrafish is an established model organism and an important tool used in genetic and chemical screening. The size and optical transparency of the embryo and larva makes them well suited for imaging using OPT. Here, we present an open-source implementation of an OPT platform, built around a customized sample stage, 3D-printed parts and open source algorithms optimized for the system. We developed a versatile automated workflow including a two-step image processing approach for correcting the center of rotation and generating accurate 3D reconstructions. Our results demonstrate high-quality 3D reconstruction using synthetic data as well as real data of live and fixed zebrafish. The presented 3D-printable OPT platform represents a fully open design, low-cost and rapid loading and unloading of samples. Our system offers the opportunity for researchers with different backgrounds to setup and run OPT for large scale experiments, particularly in studies using zebrafish larvae as their key model organism.

ID CO-CREATION
AB Collaborative arrangements between users and designers today are enacted in a broadening array of circumstances. These include extended, even years-long projects within corporations, the public and third sectors, as well as open-ended, peer-to-peer open design initiatives. Building on a literature review and analysis of four concrete participatory design projects, in this paper we argue that besides skills in selecting and implementing co-design methods, there is a larger repertoire of issues that need attention, if one takes the promises and limits of participatory design seriously. We elaborate on how these issues have purchase in the interplay of four interrelated domains: the strategic considerations that drive all those implicated, the mundane acts involved in co-design work, the choice of methods that is conditioned by strategic and mundane issues, and the producing of design outcomes permeated in turn by all the above. These domains co-constitute each other in such a way that one domain cannot easily be considered apart from the others. Participatory design understood from this perspective is not about facilitation skills, but rather skills to translate among strategic, mundane, method and design domains, and being aware of how they qualify and permeate each other in order to achieve results.

ID ATTENUATION; DEFORMATION; SEDIMENTS
AB OpenSWAP is a class of innovative open architecture, low cost autonomous vehicles for geological/geophysical studies of shallow water environments. Although they can host different types of sensors, these vehicles were specifically designed for geophysical surveys, i.e., for the acquisition of bathymetric and stratigraphic data through single- and multibeam echosounders, side-scan sonars, and seismic-reflection systems. The main characteristic of the OpenSWAP vehicles is their ability of following pre-defined routes with high accuracy under acceptable weather and sea conditions. This would open the door to 4D (repeated) surveys, which constitute a powerful tool to analyze morphological and stratigraphic changes of the sediment/water interface and of the shallow substratum eventually caused by sediment dynamics (erosion vs. deposition), slumps and gravitative failures, earthquakes (slip along seismogenic faults and secondary effects of shaking), tsunamis, etc. The low cost and the open hardware/software architectures of these systems, which can be modified by the end users, lead for planning and execution of cooperative and adaptive surveys with different instruments not yet implemented or tested. Together with a technical description of the vehicles, we provide different case studies where they were successfully employed, carried out in environments not, or very difficultly accessed through conventional systems.

AB The development of sharing economy and social media technology leads to a new design mode-community-based product design (CPD), including crowdsourcing design, open source design, and maker product design. CPD projects have the potential to use socialized design resource for creative product development because they are openly participated by a large number of socialized designers. However, CPD projects are unreliable, unpredictable, and usually endure low success rate. We believe that the reason for these problems is that many unreliable factors caused by the nature of CPD mode are disturbing the implementation of CPD projects, but few research works can provide systematic and quantitative understanding of the relationship between these factors and CPD project feasibility, which makes it difficult for stakeholders to evaluate and manage their CPD projects. To mitigate these problems, in this paper an improved Bayesian causal map approach is developed and used to build a CPD project feasibility analysis model. The model can reveal the interaction relationship among the factors, and provide quantitative evaluation of CPD project feasibility given the states of the factors. In this way, the model can help the stakeholders in CPD project management by showing them which factors require priority processing and providing them with the prediction of project success rate, and eventually improve the overall reliability of CPD projects. The model has been verified through sensitivity analysis and post analysis on real CPD projects.

Light-sheet microscopy uses orthogonal illumination and detection to create a thin sheet of light which does not illuminate the sample outside of the depth of field of the detection axis. Typically, this configuration involves a pair of orthogonal objectives which constrains the positioning and length of cover slips in the range of the detection objective. Here, we present an open-hardware sample mounting system for light-sheet microscopes using large detection objectives, built using 3D printed components and demonstrate the chamber's efficacy on live biological samples in a custom light-sheet microscope.

AB Architecture is never fixed: buildings and (urban) spaces change as their use(r)s and contexts change over time. Even when architectural projects receive recognition of their dynamic nature, it remains unclear how to deal with this during design processes. The need for sustainable building raises interest in this topic in architecture research. This interest converges with discourse on open design in other design fields. Work in human-computer interaction and industrial design engineering is generating more concrete design strategies that bring into view in design processes the dynamic with which artefacts become part of real (end-use) environments. Examples include open-ended design and open script design. We propose such strategies may enrich architectural education particularly in the face of the challenge to move towards a more sustainable architecture that changes meaningfully through time. In this article we explore the value of, and requirements for, teaching open design strategies in architectural education. In the context of a master course on actual topics in architecture we involved architectural engineering students as researchers to explore the value and applicability of these strategies in architectural design. Analysis of focus group interviews and students' intermediary and final coursework suggests that open design makes explicit a topic that is latently present to these students in their education. They perceive open design as having high societal relevance that will help them in their future practice to approach (design) problems (e.g., including environmental and social challenges) in new ways.

AB Purpose: To implement a modular, flexible, open-source hardware configuration for parallel transmission (pTx) experiments on medical implant safety and to demonstrate real-time mitigation strategies for radio frequency (RF) induced implant heating based on sensor measurements.
   Methods: The hardware comprises a home-built 8-channel pTx system (scalable to 32-channels), wideband power amplifiers and a positioning system with submillimeter precision. The orthogonal projection (OP) method is used to mitigate RF induced tip heating and to maintain sufficientB1+for imaging. Experiments are performed at 297MHz and inside a clinical 3T MRI using 8-channel pTx RF coils, a guidewire substitute inside a phantom with attached thermistor and time-domainE-field probes.
   Results: Repeatability and precision are similar to 3% forE-field measurements including guidewire repositioning, similar to 3% for temperature slopes and an similar to 6% root-mean-square deviation betweenB1+measurements and simulations. Real-time pTx mitigation with the OP mode reduces theE-fields everywhere within the investigated area with a maximum reduction factor of 26 compared to the circularly polarized mode. Tip heating was measured with similar to 100 mu K resolution and similar to 14 Hz sampling frequency and showed substantial reduction for the OP vs CP mode.
   Conclusion: The pTx medical implant safety testbed presents a much-needed flexible and modular hardware configuration for the in-vitro assessment of implant safety, covering all field strengths from 0.5-7 T. Sensor based real-time mitigation strategies utilizing pTx and the OP method allow to substantially reduce RF induced implant heating while maintaining sufficient image quality without the need for a priori knowledge based on simulations or in-vitro testing.

AB Overview In this article we frame the concept of a hardware-rich open source ecosystem (H-ROSE) that generates software and hardware components. In an H-ROSE, the designs of some components are accessible under open source licenses, while other component designs remain proprietary. We describe seven adoption factors used by the multinational French firm Thales to assess the efficacy of RISC-V to design processors. Other companies can use these adoption factors to explore whether an open hardware initiative supported by an H-ROSE is worthwhile.

DE DIY communities; COVID-19; healthcare equipment; critical making;
   hacking; open source
AB Shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) and medical devices needed during the COVID-19 pandemic were widely reported in early 2020. In response, civic DIY volunteers explored how they could produce the required equipment. Members of communities such as hacker- and makerspaces employed their skills and tools to manufacture, for example, face shields and masks. The article discusses these civic innovation practices and their broader social implications by relating them to critical making theory. Methodologically, it is based on a digital ethnography approach, focusing on hacker and maker communities in the UK. Communities' DIY initiatives display characteristics of critical making and 'craftivism', as they assessed and counteracted politicised healthcare supply shortages. It is argued that their manufacturing activities during the COVID pandemic relate to UK austerity politics' effects on healthcare and government failure to ensure medical crisis supplies. Facilitated by open source design, communities' innovation enabled healthcare emergency equipment. At the same time, their DIY manufacturing raises practical as well as ethical issues concerning, among other things, efficacy and safety of use.

AB Recently, Internet-based devices have evolved into platforms for new networks, with Internet of Things technology being applied in various areas. The expansion of scope of this technology and exchange of real-time information enables users to check their content whenever. The real-time Internet of Things motion detection platform has been developed to detect and monitor users in installed spaces. In this article, the real-time Internet of Things motion detection platform utilizes a non-contact sensor module and motion recovery printed circuit board module to quickly respond to emergency situations through real-time monitoring. This is visualized on the display by sending data extracted from the motion recovery printed circuit board module combined with open source hardware by the non-contact sensor module receiving information from smartphone users. The administrator's display continuously analyzes real-time moving objects by detecting them with respect to location coordinates and providing automatically recognized data to the cloud server. In addition, real-time Internet of Things motion detection monitoring system was configured to quickly respond to real-time alerts and effectively manage problems. Therefore, installing real-time Internet of Things motion detection platform at an actual site will enable quick resolving of emergency situations through information provision and user awareness monitoring.

AB The variable stiffness joint is a kind of flexible actuator with variable stiffness characteristics suitable for physical human-robot interaction applications. In the existing variable stiffness joints, the antagonistic variable stiffness joint has the advantages of simple implementation of variable stiffness mechanism and easy modular design of the nonlinear elastic element. The variable stiffness characteristics of antagonistic variable stiffness joints are realized by the antagonistic actuation of two nonlinear springs. A novel design scheme of the equivalent nonlinear torsion spring with compact structure, large angular displacement range, and desired stiffness characteristics is presented in this article. The design calculation for the equivalent quadratic torsion spring is given as an example, and the actuation characteristics of the antagonistic variable stiffness joint based on the equivalent quadratic torsion spring are illustrated. Based on the design idea of constructing the antagonistic variable stiffness joint with compact structure and high compliance, as well as the different design requirements of the joints at different positions of the multi-degrees of freedom robot arm, nine types of mechanical schemes of antagonistic variable stiffness joint with the open design concept are proposed in this article. Finally, the conceptual joint configuration schemes of the robot arm based on the antagonistic variable stiffness joint show the application scheme of the designed antagonistic variable stiffness joint in the multi-degrees of freedom robot.

AB Background Given the wide implications of cognitive impairment for prognosis and outcome in schizophrenia, the research on pharmacological approaches aimed at addressing dysfunctional cognition has been extensive; nevertheless, there are no currently available licensed drugs, and the evidence in this field is still unimpressive. Vortioxetine is a multimodal antidepressant, which has been proposed as a suitable treatment option for cognitive symptoms in depression. Methods Twenty schizophrenia outpatients (mean age +/- SD, 40.7 +/- 10.6 years) on stable clozapine treatment, assessed by neuropsychological (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Verbal Fluency, and Stroop task) and psychodiagnostic instruments (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS] and Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia), received vortioxetine at the single daily dose of 10 mg/d until week 12; the dose was increased at 20 mg/d afterward, and this dosage was maintained unchanged until week 24. A physical examination, electrocardiogram with QTc measurement, and laboratory tests were also performed. Results Vortioxetine supplementation significantly improved Stroop test (P= 0.013) at week 12 and Stroop test (P= 0.031) and Semantic Fluency (P= 0.002) at end point. Moreover, a significantly reduction of PANSS domains "positive" (P= 0.019) at week 12 and of PANSS domains positive (P= 0.019) and total score (P= 0.041) and of depressive symptoms (Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia,P= 0.032) at end point. There was no significant change in clinical, metabolic, and safety parameters, and no subject spontaneously reported adverse effects. Conclusions Despite the limitations (open design, lack of a control group, small sample size, and short intervention period), our findings suggest for the first time that vortioxetine augmentation of clozapine may be a promising therapeutic strategy for addressing cognitive deficits in patients with schizophrenia.

AB Currently beraprost sodium (BPS) is widely proposed to ameliorate the symptoms caused by chronic arterial occlusive disease. The objective of this study is to investigate the BPS pharmacokinetic characteristics, its vasodilating effect and the relationship between plasma concentration vs response effect. 12 healthy Chinese volunteers (6 male, 6 female) were chosen to participate in a single center, random, and open design study. After overnight fasting, BPS (dose = 40 mu g) was administrated orally to each volunteer. The blood samples were collected at different time points (from 0 to 5 h after administration) and BPS concentration was analyzed by LC-MS/MS method. The vasodilating effect was evaluated by detecting the skin microcirculation blood flow of volunteers' fingers with laser Doppler fluxmetry. The C-max of BPS was (601.14 +/- 214.81) pg/mL, the T-max was (0.58 +/- 0.48) h, and AUC(0-t) was (1020.41 +/- 214.63) pg/mL.h. BPS exhibited significant vasodilating effect since the skin microcirculation blood flow increased definitely at 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 h (all p<0.05) after drug administration, and a positive correlation was presented between the pharmacokinetics and the vasodilating effect, which would be beneficial for guiding BPS dosage in clinical.

This article presents an Heart rate and SpO(2) monitoring method without physical contact with the patient using imaging photoplethysmography. Eulerian video magnification (EVM) was employed in the proposed solution to amplify the changes in skin color due to the heart cycle. The developed software operates on a widely available, low-cost open hardware platform. Experiments were performed with nine healthy individuals. When comparing the experimental results to those obtained with a reference pulse oximeter, the proposed solution showed good accuracy in SpO(2) measurements, with a difference of less than 2%, meeting the requirements of the standard that regulates pulse oximetry equipment.

AB For five years, OpenPiton has provided hardware designs, build and verification scripts, and other infrastructure to enable efficient, detailed research into manycores and systems-on-chip. It enables open-source hardware development through its open design and support of a plethora of open simulators and CAD tools. OpenPiton was first designed to perform cutting-edge computer architecture research at Princeton University and opening it up to the public has led to thousands of downloads and numerous academic publications spanning many subfields within computing. In this article, we share some of the lessons learned during the development of OpenPiton, provide examples of how OpenPiton has been used to efficiently test novel research ideas, and discuss how OpenPiton has evolved due to its open development and feedback from the open-source community.

AB As the benefits of Moore's Law diminish, computing performance, and efficiency gains are increasingly achieved through specializing hardware to a domain of computation. However, this limits the hardware's generality and flexibility. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), microchips which can be reprogrammed to implement arbitrary digital circuits, enable the benefits of specialization while remaining flexible. A challenge to using FPGAs is the complex computer-aided design flow required to efficiently map a computation onto an FPGA. Traditionally, these design flows are closed-source and highly specialized to a particular vendor's devices. We propose an alternate data-driven approach, which uses highly adaptable and retargettable open-source tools to target both commercial and research FPGA architectures. While challenges remain, we believe this approach makes the development of novel and commercial FPGA architectures faster and more accessible. Furthermore, it provides a path forward for industry, academia, and the open-source community to collaborate and combine their resources to advance FPGA technology.

In addition to compelling benefits from using the Python language, PyMTL3 is designed to provide flexible, modular, and extensible workflows for both hardware designers and computer architects. PyMTL3 supports a seamless multilevel modeling environment and carefully designed modular software architecture using a sophisticated in-memory intermediate representation and a collection of passes that analyze, instrument, and transform PyMTL3 hardware models. We believe PyMTL3 can play an important role in jump-starting the open-source hardware ecosystem.

   Generators; Acceleration
AB RTL simulation is a critical tool for hardware design but its current slow speed often bottlenecks the whole design process. Simulation speed becomes even more crucial for agile and open-source hardware design methodologies, because the designers not only want to iterate on designs quicker, but they may also have less resources with which to simulate them. In this article, we execute multiple simulators and analyze them with hardware performance counters. We find some open-source simulators not only outperform a leading commercial simulator, they also achieve comparable or higher instruction throughput on the host processor. Although advanced optimizations may increase the complexity of the simulator, they do not significantly hinder instruction throughput. Our findings make the case that there is significant room to accelerate software simulation and open-source simulators are a great starting point for researchers.

AB The integration of large amounts of renewable energy will require multiterminal high-voltage direct-current (MTDC) grids to reliably transport the energy over long distances. However, before building an MTDC grid, a functional protection system design is needed. Realistic and industrial studies are required to validate the functionality of such a system. In addition, further academic research as well as education in the field are needed. This paper presents an open-source, low-cost protection intelligent electronic device (IED) prototype for use in a laboratory environment. In particular, the IED design, its fastest measured performance, example results for different fault scenarios, and an assessment of its use in education are shown. The open-source IED is useful to accelerate industrial and academic research, as well as to enable education in protection for MTDC grids.

We design and build the hardware using a reduced number of components and with a very low-cost. Moreover, we propose a method for the detection of open eyes (oE) and closed eyes (cE) states based on computing a power ratio between different frequency bands of the acquired signal. We compare several real- and complex-valued transformations combined with two decision strategies: a threshold-based method and a linear discriminant analysis. Simulation results show both classifier accuracies and their corresponding system delays.

ID CONTINUUM ROBOTS
AB Soft continuum robots have the potential to revolutionize minimally invasive surgery. The challenges for such robots are ubiquitous; functioning within sensitive, unstructured and convoluted environments which are inconsistent between patients. As such, there exists an open design problem for robots of this genre. Research currently exists relating to the design considerations of on-board actuated soft robots such as fluid and tendon driven manipulators. Magnetically reactive robots, however, exhibit off-board actuation and consequently demonstrate far greater potential for miniaturization and dexterity. In this letter we present a soft, magnetically actuated, slender, shape forming 'tentacle-like' robot. To overcome the associated design challenges we also propose a novel design methodology based on a Neural Network trained using Finite Element Simulations. We demonstrate how our design approach generates static, two-dimensional tentacle profiles under homogeneous actuation based on predefined, desired deformations. To demonstrate our learnt approach, we fabricate and actuate candidate tentacles of 2 mm diameter and 42 mm length producing shape profiles within 8% mean absolute percentage error of desired shapes. With this proof of concept, we make the first step towards showing how tentacles with bespoke magnetic profiles may be designed and manufactured to suit specific anatomical constraints.

In Colombia, few buildings have an energy management system characterized by its adaptability to the user and with a certain degree of intelligence. Thus, this document describes the summarized research process for the development of an Internet of Things (IoT) system, which has been designed to promote an intelligent lighting service in an academic environment. The IoT system orchestrates a series of sensors, monitoring systems and controlled actions, all based on the principle of making the system functions and consumption records available in real-time, via web services. The devices used are "Things" with improved functionality, becoming "Smart Things" within the IoT paradigm. Methodologically, an experimental process was followed, linking the development of electronic tools, the construction of services, and the development of interfaces for a pleasant user experience. Research contributes to two essential areas: intelligent buildings, through the intelligent adaptation of an environment; and sustainability and eco-innovation, since the system provides appropriate information for environmental education, in terms of real-time energy consumption, that impacts directly on the fair-use culture of a service expensive for the environment.

AB Distributed digital manufacturing offers a solution to medical supply and technology shortages during pandemics. To prepare for the next pandemic, this study reviews the state-of-the-art of open hardware designs needed in a COVID-19-like pandemic. It evaluates the readiness of the top twenty technologies requested by the Government of India. The results show that the majority of the actual medical products have some open source development, however, only 15% of the supporting technologies required to produce them are freely available. The results show there is still considerable research needed to provide open source paths for the development of all the medical hardware needed during pandemics. Five core areas of future research are discussed, which include (i) technical development of a wide-range of open source solutions for all medical supplies and devices, (ii) policies that protect the productivity of laboratories, makerspaces, and fabrication facilities during a pandemic, as well as (iii) streamlining the regulatory process, (iv) developing Good-Samaritan laws to protect makers and designers of open medical hardware, as well as to compel those with knowledge that will save lives to share it, and (v) requiring all citizen-funded research to be released with free and open source licenses.

AB This report describes a direction-dependent optical microscope operated with Raspberry Pi, with LED array illumination patterns controlled by Raspberry Pi. Images are obtained with a Raspberry Pi camera module. We demonstrate the use of Raspberry-Pi-based microscopes for multimodal imaging including bright-field microscopy, dark-field microscopy, differential phase-contrast microscopy, and polarization microscopy. We also demonstrate acquisition of direction-dependent dark-field and differential phase-contrast images. From a pair of opposite line or rectangular illumination, structures along the illumination axis were enhanced in dark-field images and differential phase-contrast images. Raspberry-Pi is open-source hardware. Raspberry-Pi-based compact, cost-effective, and multi-contrast microscopes are expected to be useful for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education.

AB To extend the choice of inertial motion-tracking systems freely available to researchers and educators, this paper presents an alternative open-source design of a wearable 7-DOF wireless human arm motion-tracking system. Unlike traditional inertial motion-capture systems, the presented system employs a hybrid combination of two inertial measurement units and one potentiometer for tracking a single arm. The sequence of three design phases described in the paper demonstrates how the general concept of a portable human arm motion-tracking system was transformed into an actual prototype, by employing a modular approach with independent wireless data transmission to a control PC for signal processing and visualization. Experimental results, together with an application case study on real-time robot-manipulator teleoperation, confirm the applicability of the developed arm motion-tracking system for facilitating robotics research. The presented arm-tracking system also has potential to be employed in mechatronic system design education and related research activities. The system CAD design models and program codes are publicly available online and can be used by robotics researchers and educators as a design platform to build their own arm-tracking solutions for research and educational purposes.

AB Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties with social interaction, repetitive behavior, and additional features, such as special interests. Its precise etiology is unclear. Recently, immunological mechanisms, such as maternal autoantibodies/infections, have increasingly been the subject of discussion. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) investigations play a decisive role in the detection of immunological processes in the brain. This study therefore retrospectively analyzed the CSF findings of adult patients with ASD. CSF basic measures (white blood cell count, total protein, albumin quotient, immunoglobulin G (IgG) index, and oligoclonal bands) and various antineuronal antibody findings of 36 adult patients with ASD, who had received lumbar puncture, were compared with an earlier described mentally healthy control group of 39 patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. CSF protein concentrations and albumin quotients of patients with ASD were significantly higher as compared to controls (age corrected: p=0.003 and p=0.004, respectively); 17% of the patients with ASD showed increased albumin quotients. After correction for age and gender, the group effect for total protein remained significant (p=0.041) and showed a tendency for albumin quotient (p=0.079). In the CSF of two ASD patients, an intrathecal synthesis of anti-glutamate decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) antibodies was found. In total, more of the ASD patients (44%) presented abnormal findings in CSF basic diagnostics compared to controls (18%; p=0.013). A subgroup of the patients with adult ASD showed indication of a blood-brain barrier dysfunction, and two patients displayed an intrathecal synthesis of anti-GAD65 antibodies; thus, the role of these antibodies in patients with ASD should be further investigated. The results of the study are limited by its retrospective and open design. The group differences in blood-brain barrier markers could be influenced by a different gender distribution between ASD patients and controls.

TI Low-cost, easy-to-build noninvasive pressure support ventilator for
   under-resourced regions: open source hardware description, performance
   and feasibility testing
SO EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID BREATHING PATTERN; MECHANICAL VENTILATORS; ASSIST; HEALTH; BENCH
AB Aim: Current pricing of commercial mechanical ventilators in low-/middle-income countries (LMICs) markedly restricts their availability, and consequently a considerable number of patients with acute/chronic respiratory failure cannot be adequately treated. Our aim was to design and test an affordable and easy-to-build noninvasive bilevel pressure ventilator to allow a reduction in the serious shortage of ventilators in LMICs.
   Methods: The ventilator was built using off-the-shelf materials available via e-commerce and was based on a high-pressure blower, two pressure transducers and an Arduino Nano controller with a digital display (total retail cost <75 USD), with construction details provided open source for free replication. The ventilator was evaluated, and compared with a commercially available device (Lumis 150 ventilator; Resmed, San Diego, CA, USA): 1) in the bench setting using an actively breathing patient simulator mimicking a range of obstructive/restrictive diseases; and b) in 12 healthy volunteers wearing high airway resistance and thoracic/abdominal bands to mimic obstructive/restrictive patients.
   Results: The designed ventilator provided inspiratory/expiratory pressures up to 20/10 cm H2O, respectively, with no faulty triggering or cycling; both in the bench test and in volunteers. The breathing difficulty score rated (1-10 scale) by the loaded breathing subjects was significantly (p<0.005) decreased from 5.45 +/- 1.68 without support to 2.83 +/- 1.66 when using the prototype ventilator, which showed no difference with the commercial device (2.80 +/- 1.48; p=1.000).
   Conclusion: The low-cost, easy-to-build noninvasive ventilator performs similarly to a high-quality commercial device, with its open-source hardware description, which will allow for free replication and use in LMICs, facilitating application of this life-saving therapy to patients who otherwise could not be treated.

TI Correlation between process openness and collaboration tool usage in
   open source hardware design: an empirical study

DE Open design; Collaborative design; Empirical study
AB Open source hardware has developed rapidly since the last 2 decades, thanks to access to Internet and availability of novel interactive manufacturing technologies (for example 3D printing or collaborative platforms). Several researchers worked on how to characterize OSH. Bonvoisin and Mies (Procedia CIRP 78:388-393, 2018) defined the "open-o-meter", i.e. a series of criteria to measure the openness of an OSH project. These criteria fall into two categories: product openness and process openness. The open-o-meter gives clear guidelines on measuring product openness by verifying access to specific types of documents, however the criteria to measure process openness are relatively implicit. In this paper, we propose to measure an OSH project's process openness by identifying different types of collaboration tools in that project. We will evaluate 226 OSH projects' process openness by analysing their usage of collaboration tools, for example social media, wiki, GitHub etc. This empirical study showed that the usage of collaboration tools in OSH projects decreases as the score of open-o-meter decreases, which implies that the open-o-meter measures correctly an OSH project's process openness. This research not only validates open-o-meter, but also offers an explicit way to measure an OSH project's process openness that might be very useful for companies to evaluate potential collaborations.

AB Free and open-source hardware (FOSH) is rapidly gaining momentum because it provides customized research hardware with over 90% savings compared to the costs of proprietary tools. However, the focused skill sets of researchers who aim to facilitate their own research limit FOSH complexity. The most expensive research equipment normally requires an interdisciplinary team. To overcome this complexity barrier and obtain large returns on investment for research funders by replacing the most expensive proprietary research equipment with FOSH, new development funding mechanisms are needed. To guide such research policy, this paper provides the first analysis of the strategic national benefit of applying the FOSH approach to major research equipment for any nation. The results of an example analysis for a single nation indicate Finland's science funders could save between 2.84-27.7m(sic)/year directly on scientific equipment purchases if research hardware is converted to FOSH and the nation would likely garner the well-established concomitant benefits of increased research innovation within their economy. Finally, a detailed generalized model for determining national research policy in hardware development is derived and research policy mechanisms for accelerating FOSH deployment and greater accessibility to research equipment are discussed.

AB High-speed imaging equipment can be an expensive investment, especially when certain applications require custom solutions. In this paper, we present a low-cost high-speed prototype camera built on a low-end Zynq-7000 System-on-Chip (SoC) platform and off-the-shelf components with the aim of removing the entry barrier into various high-speed imaging applications. The camera is standalone (does not require a host computer) and can achieve 211 frames per second (fps) at its maximum resolution of 1280x1024, and up to 2329 fps at a 256x256 resolution. With a current cost of only several hundred dollars and resource utilization of similar to 5%, the open-source design's modularity and customizability allows users with sufficient hardware or programming experience to modify the camera to suit their needs, potentially driving the cost lower. This can be done by utilizing the large remaining programmable logic for custom image processing algorithms, creating user interface software on the CPU, attaching extensions through the peripheral Module connections, or creating custom carrier or daughter boards. The development and design of the camera is described and a figure-of-merit is presented to provide a value assessment of some available commercial high-speed cameras against which our camera is competitive. Finally, the camera was tested to record low frequency spatial vibration and was found to be useful in investigating phenotypes associated with aging in a leading animal model, the nematode (worm) Caenorhabditis elegans.

SO INDUSTRIAL ROBOT-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS RESEARCH AND
   APPLICATION
LA English
DT Article
DE Medical robots; Rehabilitation robots; Healthcare robots
ID ADAPTIVE-CONTROL; NEUROREHABILITATION; SYSTEM
AB Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to design and develop a new robotic device for the rehabilitation of the upper limbs. The authors are focusing on a new symmetrical robot which can be used to rehabilitate the right upper limb and the left upper limb. The robotic arm can be automatically extended or reduced depending on the measurements of the patient's arm. The main idea is to integrate electrical stimulation into motor rehabilitation by robot. The goal is to provide automatic electrical stimulation based on muscle status during the rehabilitation process.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The developed robotic arm can be automatically extended or reduced depending on the measurements of the patient's arm. The system merges two rehabilitation strategies: motor rehabilitation and electrical stimulation. The goal is to take the advantages of both approaches. Electrical stimulation is often used for building muscle through endurance, resistance and strength exercises. However, in the proposed approach the electrical stimulation is used for recovery, relaxation and pain relief. In addition, the device includes an electromyography (EMG) muscle sensor that records muscle activity in real time. The control architecture provides the ability to automatically activate the appropriate stimulation mode based on the acquired EMG signal. The system software provides two modes for stimulation activation: the manual preset mode and the EMG driven mode. The program ensures traceability and provides the ability to issue a patient status monitoring report.
   Findings
   The developed robotic device is symmetrical and reconfigurable. The presented rehabilitation system includes a muscle stimulator associated with the robot to improve the quality of the rehabilitation process. The integration of neuromuscular electrical stimulation into the physical rehabilitation process offers effective rehabilitation sessions for neuromuscular recovery of the upper limb. A laboratory-made stimulator is developed to generate three modes of stimulation: pain relief, massage and relaxation. Through the control software interface, the physiotherapist can set the exercise movement parameters, define the stimulation mode and record the patient training in real time.
   Research limitations/implications
   There are certain constraints when applying the proposed method, such as the sensitivity of the acquired EMG signals. This involves the use of professional equipment and mainly the implementation of sophisticated algorithms for signal extraction.
   Practical implications
   Functional electrical stimulation and robot-based motor rehabilitation are the most important technologies applied in post-stroke rehabilitation. The main objective of integrating robots into the rehabilitation process is to compensate for the functions lost in people with physical disabilities. The stimulation technique can be used for recovery, relaxation and drainage and pain relief. In this context, the idea is to integrate electrical stimulation into motor rehabilitation based on a robot to obtain the advantages of the two approaches to further improve the rehabilitation process. The introduction of this type of robot also makes it possible to develop new exciting assistance devices.
   Originality/value
   The proposed design is symmetrical, reconfigurable and light, covering all the joints of the upper limbs and their movements. In addition, the developed platform is inexpensive and a portable solution based on open source hardware platforms which opens the way to more extensions and developments.
   Electrical stimulation is often used to improve motor function and restore loss of function. However, the main objective behind the proposed stimulation in this paper is to recover after effort. The novelty of the proposed solution is to integrate the electrical stimulation powered by EMG in robotic rehabilitation.

AB The development of light-sheet fluorescence microscopy has been a revolution for developmental biology as it allows long-term imaging during embryonic development. An important reason behind the quick adoption has been the availability of open hardware alternatives. In this work, we present a robust and compact version of a light-sheet fluorescence microscope that is easy to assemble and requires little to no maintenance. An important aspect of the design is that the illumination unit consists of reflective elements, thereby reducing chromatic aberrations an order of magnitude as compared to refractive counterparts.

AB This article presents the theoretical analysis of passive charge sharing-based segmented successive-approximation-register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC), where the precise reference source in a capacitive digital-to-analog converter (CDAC) is replaced by a capacitor that is \beta times larger than its bit capacitor and precharged to the reference level, known as a reference charge reservoir (RCR). A segmented SAR-ADC uses a coarse SAR-ADC to compute some most significant bits (MSBs). Four methods, namely aligned switching (AS) with bitwise RCRs, AS with a subsample-wise RCR, detect-and-skip aligned switching (DAS-AS) with bitwise RCRs, and DAS-AS with a subsample-wise RCR are introduced for setting fine MSBs. Closed-form analytic expressions of the reference error due to the finite reference capacitance are derived and validated by behavioral modeling and circuit simulation of an 11-bit 50 MS/s segmented SAR ADC in 65-nm CMOS technology. The error expressions can be used to select one of the four methods for setting the fine MSBs and to determine \beta for the required linearity or for implementing digital circuitry for precise error correction.

AB In this work, the generation and posterior chemometric resolution of third-order data, obtained from samples processed by liquid chromatography (LC) with online registering of excitation-emission fluorescence matrices (EEM) is reported. Samples were instrumentally processed in a relatively short time, and neither an intentional reduction of the linear flow rate nor an unconventional fluorescence instrument were required. Through the inclusion of external circuitry based on open-source hardware, the occurrence time of each individual fluorescence intensity reading was recorded. For the reported instrumental setup, irregular signal sampling was verified. In order to consider samples-specific time measurements, the PARAFAC (Parallel Factor Analysis) algorithm, and the derived APARAFAC (Augmented-PARAFAC) strategy, were adapted. The functional information was employed during the computational stages, through the development and implementation of smoothing strategies. To tackle differences between the rate of spectral acquisition and the rate of change in the concentration of the mobile fluorophores, Expectation Maximization was implemented. Data from samples with one calibrated analyze (Vitamin B6-Pyridoxine), in presence of uncalibrated interferents, were modeled. In order to preserve the original data structure, unfolding data operations were minimized. The resolved profiles of all species were in agreement with the corresponding chromatographic and spectral references. Results suggest that the effects derived from the loss of trilinearity previously reported in the literature for LC-EEM data, depend on interpretation and subsequent modeling of the data. The reported strategies can be useful with other flow techniques and kinetics.

AB Imaging and manipulating individual atoms with submicrometer separation can be instrumental for quantum simulation of condensed matter Hamiltonians and quantum computation with neutral atoms. Here we present an open-source design of a microscope objective for atomic strontium, consisting solely of off-the-shelf lenses, that is diffraction-limited for 461 nm light. A prototype built with a simple stacking design is measured to have a resolution of 0.63(4) mu m, which is in agreement with the predicted value. This performance, together with the near diffraction-limited performance for 532 nm light, makes this design useful for both quantum gas microscopes and optical tweezer experiments with strontium. Our microscope can easily be adapted to experiments with other atomic species such as erbium, ytterbium, and dysprosium, as with rubidium Rydberg atoms.

TI Developing synthetic biology in Argentina: the Latin American TECNOx

ID EMERGENCE; NETWORK; DESIGN
AB Synthetic biology emerged in the USA and Europe twenty years ago and quickly developed innovative research and technology as a result of continued funding. Synthetic biology is also growing in many developing countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America, where it could have a large economic impact by helping its use of genetic biodiversity in order to boost existing industries. Starting in 2011, Argentine synthetic biology developed along an idiosyncratic path. In 2011-2012, the main focus was not exclusively research but also on community building through teaching and participation in iGEM, following the template of the early "MIT school" of synthetic biology. In 2013-2015, activities diversified and included society-centered projects, social science studies on synthetic biology and bioart. Standard research outputs such as articles and industrial applications helped consolidate several academic working groups. Since 2016, the lack of a critical mass of researchers and a funding crisis were partially compensated by establishing links with Latin American synthetic biologists and with other socially oriented open technology collectives. The TECNOx community is a central node in this growing research and technology network. The first four annual TECNOx meetings brought together synthetic biologists with other open science and engineering platforms and explored the relationship of Latin American technologies with entrepreneurship, open hardware, ethics and human rights. In sum, the socioeconomic context encouraged Latin American synthetic biology to develop in a meandering and diversifying manner. This revealed alternative ways for growth of the field that may be relevant to other developing countries.

AB Due to a lack of autonomy and difficulty in social interactions, people with physical disabilities generally suffer from a diminished quality of life. The following document describes the development of a low-cost mobile platform capable of assisting people with severe motor disabilities on independent social interactions.Platform requires a wireless mobile base; adapting two interaction devices, a camera and an eye tracker; and developing a software to integrate all components for an easy-to-use application. Then, in order to validate the operation of the platform, several tests were carried out, using a usability measurement methodology, with different users within a certain age range, with and without disabilities. Consequently, as a first instance of validation, the low-cost platform fulfills the expected function of social interaction assistance for people with disabilities. Finally, as it is an open design and its functioning has been verified, all the necessary information for the construction of the device is freely accessible through the project's electronic page.

   (IoT); automatic repeat request (AQR); open hardware; open source
AB In our modern world, many Internet of Things (IoT) technologies are being researched and developed. IoT devices are currently being used in many fields. IoT devices use Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, however, communication distance is short and battery consumption is high. In areas such as smart cities and smart farms, IoT technology is needed to support a wide coverage with low power consumption. Low Power Wide Area (LPWA), which is a transmission used in IoT supporting a wide area with low power consumption, has evolved. LPWA includes Long Range (LoRa), Narrowband (NB-IoT), and Sigfox. LoRa offers many benefits as it communicates the longest distances, is cheap and consumes less battery. LoRa is used in many countries and covers a range of hundreds of square kilometers (km(2)) with a single gateway. However, if there are many obstacles to smart cities and smart farms, it causes communication problems. This paper proposes two (2) solutions to this problem: the relay method which is a multi-hop method and the Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) system that detects packet loss in real-time and requests retransmission for LoRa. In this study, the actual performance of LoRa in the problematic environment was measured and the proposed method was applied. It was confirmed that the transmission rate of LoRa dropped when there were many obstacles such as trees. To use LoRa in a smart farm with a lot of space, multi-hop was observed to be better. An ARQ system is needed to compensate for the unexpected drop in the forward rate due to the increase in IoT devices. This research focused on reliability, however, additional network methods and automatic repeat request (ARQ) systems considering battery time should be researched in symmetry. This study covers the interdisciplinary field of computer science and wireless low power communication engineering. We have analyzed the LoRa/LoRaWAN technology in an experimental approach, which has been somewhat less studied than cellular network or WiFi technology. In addition, we presented and improved the performance evaluation results in consideration of various local and climatic environments.

AB With the current rapid spread of COVID-19, global health systems are increasingly overburdened by the sheer number of people that need diagnosis, isolation and treatment. Shortcomings are evident across the board, from staffing, facilities for rapid and reliable testing to availability of hospital beds and key medical-grade equipment. The scale and breadth of the problem calls for an equally substantive response not only from frontline workers such as medical staff and scientists, but from skilled members of the public who have the time, facilities and knowledge to meaningfully contribute to a consolidated global response. Here, we summarise community-driven approaches based on Free and Open Source scientific and medical Hardware (FOSH) as well as personal protective equipment (PPE) currently being developed and deployed to support the global response for COVID-19 prevention, patient treatment and diagnostics.

TI A high-resolution polarimeter formed from inexpensive optical parts
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
ID ROTATORY DISPERSION; DFT
AB We describe a high resolution laser polarimeter built from commodity optical components. The optical rotation angle is determined by measuring the phase difference between two harmonically modulated polarised laser beams - an 'object beam' that passes through the sample under test and a 'reference beam' that bypasses the sample. The complete polarimeter may be assembled from low cost off-the-shelf parts for less than 300 pound (UK Sterling). Data acquisition and analysis are carried out on a microcontroller running an efficient algorithm based on the sliding Discrete Fourier Transform. Despite its low cost, the polarimeter is a fully automatic, research-grade instrument with an accuracy of +/- 0.0013 degrees and a precision of +/- 0.0028 degrees - comparable to far costlier commercial instruments. The polarimeter's ease of use, compact size, fast measurement times and high angular resolution make it a capable and versatile tool for analytical science, while its low cost means it is ideally suited for use in resource-constrained environments and process monitoring. The polarimeter is released here as open hardware, with technical diagrams, a full parts list, and source code for its firmware included as Supplementary Information.

TI Time-dependent enhancement of fluorescence from Rhodobacter capsulatus

AB Continuous exposure of 395 nm light increases the fluorescence emission intensity of photosynthetic purple non-sulphur bacteria, Rhodobacter capsulatus (SB1003). We show that such an increase in fluorescence emission of extracellular pigment complexes (PC) from these photosynthetic bacteria depends on the concentration of the pigment and temperature and can also be modulated by the static magnetic field. The time-dependent enhanced emission disappears either at or below 300 K or below a threshold sample concentration (0.1 mg/ml). The enhanced emission reappears at this condition (T < 278 K) if a static magnetic field (395 mT) is introduced during fluorescence measurement. The time dependence of emission is expressed in terms of a first-order rate constant, k = dF/(Fdt). The sign of k shifts from positive to negative as PC concentration is lowered than a threshold value, implying onset of fluorescence decay (k < 0) rather than amplification (k > 0). At PC concentration higher than a threshold, k becomes negative if the temperature is lowered. But, surprisingly, at low temperature, a static magnetic field reverts the k value to positive. We explain the logical nature of k-switching and photo-dynamics of the aforesaid microbial fluorescence emission by aggregation of protoporphyrin rings present in the PC. While the simultaneous presence of decay in fluorescence and susceptibility to static magnetic field suggests the dominance of triplet states at low temperatures, the process is reversed by SMF-induced removal of spin degeneracy. At higher temperatures, the optical excitability and lack of magnetic response suggest the dominance of singlet states. We propose that the restructuring of the singlet-triplet distribution by intersystem crossing may be the basis of this logical behaviour. In context with microbial function, time-dependent enhancement of fluorescence also implies relay of red photons to the neighbouring microbes not directly exposed to the incident radiation, thus serving as an indirect photosynthetic regulator.

AB We report a simple means to build a model atomic force microscope (AFM) using 3D printing of thermoplastic materials that are commercially available. The model has many of the key parts of an actual AFM including a z-axis stage, an AFM head with a cantilever assembly, and a laser source that reflects off of the back of the cantilever. Using a magnet attached to the tip of the cantilever and a metal sample, this model AFM enables acquisition of force-distance profiles with characteristic snap-in, pull-off, separate, and contact regions. The model AFM was designed, printed, and used by first- and second-year undergraduate students. Through completion of this project, students learned scientific instrument design and construction via 3D printing and obtained first-hand practice in the measurement of force-distance profiles and the elastic constants of cantilevers. The open design of the model can easily accommodate additional capabilities in which students are interested, e.g., topographical scanning and using cantilevers made from different materials.

AB Accurate building energy assessments are often limited by inaccurate assumptions about the buildings' properties and occupant behavior. Many assessment methods use assumptions instead of measured data because it is cumbersome, time-intensive, and cost-intensive to acquire up-to-date, on-site measured data. This work bridges this gap by presenting the design of an open-source, wireless sensor network (WSN) that is easy to program, manufacture, modify, and deploy. The version of the WSN presented here measures air temperature, relative humidity, supply and return temperature of hot water from the heating system and the radiators, heat flux through the walls and the windows, luminosity, oil flow, electricity, window opening times, and CO2-concentration. The modularity of the WSN allows it to be extended with the addition of new types of sensors to the existing hardware framework. The data is streamed to an online database, allowing monitoring of the measurements in near real-time. The cost and performance of the sensor network are intended to be as good as or better than the existing solutions. The current cost for one temperature sensor node starts at 116 USD. The observed battery lifetime reaches up to a year for a five-minute sampling interval. The average installation time for a sensor node is 7 min. We describe the hardware architecture, software architecture, cost of the WSN, along with results from co-location tests, and a deployment in an occupied building.

AB This paper reviews the relationship between the production of steel and the environment as it stands today. It deals with raw material issues (availability, scarcity), energy resources, and generation of by-products, i.e., the circular economy, the anthropogenic iron mine, and the energy transition. The paper also deals with emissions to air (dust, Particulate Matter, heavy metals, Persistant Organics Pollutants), water, and soil, i.e., with toxicity, ecotoxicity, epidemiology, and health issues, but also greenhouse gas emissions, i.e., climate change. The loss of biodiversity is also mentioned. All these topics are analyzed with historical hindsight and the present understanding of their physics and chemistry is discussed, stressing areas where knowledge is still lacking. In the face of all these issues, technological solutions were sought to alleviate their effects: many areas are presently satisfactorily handled (the circular economy-a historical' practice in the case of steel, energy conservation, air/water/soil emissions) and in line with present environmental regulations; on the other hand, there are important hanging issues, such as the generation of mine tailings (and tailings dam failures), the emissions of greenhouse gases (the steel industry plans to become carbon-neutral by 2050, at least in the EU), and the emission of fine PM, which WHO correlates with premature deaths. Moreover, present regulatory levels of emissions will necessarily become much stricter.

AB This article presents a methodology to recycle and upgrade a 4-DOF educational robot manipulator with a gripper. The robot is upgraded by providing it an artificial vision that allows obtaining the position and shape of objects collected by it. A low-cost and open-source hardware solution is also proposed to achieve motion control of the robot through a decentralized control scheme. The robot joints are actuated through five direct current motors coupled to optical encoders. Each encoder signal is fed to a proportional integral derivative controller with anti-windup that employs the motor velocity provided by a state observer. The motion controller works with only two open-architecture Arduino Mega boards, which carry out data acquisition of the optical encoder signals. MATLAB-Simulink is used to implement the controller as well as a friendly graphical interface, which allows the user to interact with the manipulator. The communication between the Arduino boards and MATLAB-Simulink is performed in real-time utilizing the Arduino IO Toolbox. Through the proposed controller, the robot follows a trajectory to collect a desired object, avoiding its collision with other objects. This fact is verified through a set of experiments presented in the paper.

AB Social sustainability is a growing concern for supply chain management, but questionable practices endure due to insufficient stakeholder pressure on the market leading firms. Meanwhile small, socially oriented firms may have the will but lack the means to change dominant practices when entering a market. In this context 3D printing may offer a solution, by leveraging the voluntary effort of individuals through open design and distributed production. A system dynamics approach is applied to the case of a socially oriented mobile phone producer, whose fair supply chain practices may initially appeal only to a niche market. We examine how open design of 3D printed mobile phone accessories helps overcome size-related resource constraints, facilitate market growth and ultimately generate sufficient consumer demand to alter the market leaders' supply chain practices, in favour of social sustainability. Our findings demonstrate the interaction between availability of 3D printers, consumer attitudes to social sustainability and the market entry. We discuss the implications for technology management, namely that 3D printing can help overcome resource constraints to support the diffusion of socially sustainable supply chain innovation.

AB Robust and accurate pose estimation is crucial for many applications in mobile robotics. Extending visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) with other modalities such as an inertial measurement unit (IMU) can boost robustness and accuracy. However, for a tight sensor fusion, accurate time synchronization of the sensors is often crucial. Changing exposure times, internal sensor filtering, multiple clock sources and unpredictable delays from operation system scheduling and data transfer can make sensor synchronization challenging. In this paper, we present VersaVIS, an Open Versatile Multi-Camera Visual-Inertial Sensor Suite aimed to be an efficient research platform for easy deployment, integration and extension for many mobile robotic applications. VersaVIS provides a complete, open-source hardware, firmware and software bundle to perform time synchronization of multiple cameras with an IMU featuring exposure compensation, host clock translation and independent and stereo camera triggering. The sensor suite supports a wide range of cameras and IMUs to match the requirements of the application. The synchronization accuracy of the framework is evaluated on multiple experiments achieving timing accuracy of less than 1 ms. Furthermore, the applicability and versatility of the sensor suite is demonstrated in multiple applications including visual-inertial SLAM, multi-camera applications, multi-modal mapping, reconstruction and object based mapping.

AB With the global electricity demand witnessing a 3.1 percent jump in 2017, there is an increasing need for incorporating intermittent renewable energy sources and other alternative supply/demand management strategies into the supply grid networks. Short-term load forecasting models enable prediction of future power consumption, thereby encouraging shifting of loads and optimizing the use of stochastic power sources and stored energy. To make the electric grid system smart and sustainable, two-way communication between the utility and consumers must be set up and the working equipment must respond digitally to the quickly changing electric demand. The proposed work exploits the power of embedded systems to design a low-cost solution for interconnecting electrical and electronic devices, controlled by the intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) paradigms. This work primarily focuses on implementing standard regression and machine learning-based architectures for smart grid load analysis and forecasting. A state of the art ecosystem for a portable load forecasting device is proposed by means of low-cost, open-source hardware that is experimentally found to be functioning with a high degree of accuracy. Further, the performance of the classical and advanced machine learning models, emulated on the device, are analyzed on the basis of various parameters, including error percentage, execution time, CPU core temperatures, and resource utilization. Overall impressive performance is demonstrated by some specific machine learning models which are considered to be suitable for the proposed framework. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A new open-hardware bioreactor capable of applying electrical field stimulation in conjunction with static or cyclic stretch is presented. Stretch is applied to cells by a specially designed elastomeric membrane with a central seeding region. The main interest of our approach is the fine control of the characteristics of stimulations in regard to timing and amplitude in a simple design based on affordable, easy to find components and 3D printable parts. Our approach opens the way to more complex protocols for electrical and/or mechanical stimulations, which are known important regulators of cardiac phenotypes. (C) 2020 Author(s).

AB An open-source syringe pump has been developed for use in the analytical laboratory. Most pump parts are made on a 3D printer. Other parts (lead screw, guide rods, stepper motor, bearings, electronic components) are purchased in specialized stores. The control panel is based on the Arduino UNO. Device interaction, any settings changes, and operating mode selection are carried out using the LCD Keypad Shield (no computer connection required). The program for the microcontroller is written in Arduino IDE. Assembling the syringe pump takes several hours and requires almost no soldering. Universal clamp allows installing any syringe with a diameter of 6 to 25 mm. The syringe pump can both infuse the liquid and refill the empty syringe. To evaluate the analytical characteristics, a 10-mL glass syringe (Kloehn) was used. The dispensed volume was 1 and 5 mL. The systematic error was less than 0.1%, and the random one was less than 3 mu L. Project files are available at: http://www.mass-spec.ru/projects/diy/syringe_pump/eng/..

AB This article describes the key steps on how to construct the Dark Sky Simulator, the outcome of the Dark Sky Sim project. The Dark Sky Simulator is a "physical simulator" to demonstrate the effects of light pollution on the starry sky and the concept of proper lighting. The simulator consists of an LED sky model simulating the starry sky and LED model streetlighting. The simulator creates for users a first-hand experience of light pollution caused by various light fixtures. The simulator was successfully completed, and information on how to construct a simulator with simple tools and inexpensive components are made available online for free. Building the simulator is a very exciting STEM project involving hands-on construction and programming skills in addition to learning astronomy concepts, making it a useful resource for both educational and outreach communities. The project was funded by the International Astronomical Union Office of Astronomy for Development (IAU OAD).

AB The founding of the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS) vision was originally presented in U.S. Geological Survey Circular 1188 (U.S. Geological Survey [USGS], 1999), after many years of discussions and workshops, described in detail by Filson and Arabasz (2016). Much has been accomplished in the ensuing two decades. Disparate and sometimes divergent developments that had been previously explored at individual private and public universities were finally centralized with increased efficiency and coherency of effort. The stated mission of the ANSS is to "... provide accurate and timely data and information products for seismic events, including their effects on buildings and structures, employing modern monitoring methods and technologies." In this article, an approach (xQuake) is proposed that does not interfere in any way with the mission of the National Earthquake Information Center and ANSS but instead restores much of the community focus and international collaboration that has been lost over the past two decades. xQuake uses an executable graph framework in a pipeline architecture; this framework can be seamlessly integrated into current ANSS quake monitoring systems. This newapproach incorporatesmodern approaches to computer analytics, including multitopic Kafka exchange rings, cloud computing, a self-configuring phase associator, and machine learning. The xGraph system is free for noncommercial use, open source, hardware agnostic (Windows, Linux, Mac), with no requirement for commercial datastores.

TI Palimpsest and heterotopia, metaphors of the Circular Economy
SO MATERIAUX & TECHNIQUES
LA English
DT Article
DE Circular Economy; material efficiency; geobiochemical cycle; palimpsest;
   heterotopia; metaphor; materials; SSH
AB Words like palimpsest or heterotopia do not belong to the working vocabulary of materials or engineering sciences: they are used in Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH). A palimpsest is a manuscript written on an older document, the text of which has been erased. Heterotopia is a young word forged by Michel Foucault in 1967 to describe a closed space, the boundaries of which mark a discontinuity in terms of behavior: a jail or a monastery are thus a heterotopia. The Circular Economy (CE) is an essential concept in the framework of the ecological transition, pulled by a series of converging economic, ecological and political drivers. It is usually described as the adoption of a circular model of production to replace the "linear model", but also as the new buzzword to describe material efficiency, the 3-R rule, the zero-waste ideal, the concepts of lean or frugal design or their reformulation by the Ellen Macarthur Foundation, as a societal challenge and an ethical necessity. Materials producers claim that they have been practicing the Circular Economy since long before the expression was ever invented, thus a la Monsieur Jourdain, etc. The point of this paper is to describe the Circular Economy as a palimpsest and as a heterotopia and to use the metaphors, if indeed they are only metaphors, to highlight some of the less obvious features of the CE. A palimpsest is a parchment or a papyrus, which is used several times to support a series of consecutive texts. Secondary raw materials are like a palimpsest, because there are retrieved from a previous life and used again in a second life: a new artefact made from that material is like a new text written on/with this material-a metaphor also used, mutatis mutandis, in expressions like 3-D printing or laser scribing. Some interesting features of the CE pointed out by the metaphor: a the palimpsest can be used several times, like a material can be recycled several times; the concept of the palimpsest posits that the parchment is somehow more important than the text that is written on it, therefore a material is more important than the goods that are made of it; the palimpsest was used before the invention of paper and, similarly, the Circular Economy was the standard model before mass production of cheap consumer goods imposed the so-called "linear model"; a palimpsest keeps a fragmented memory of the past, in the same way as recycled material maintains a link to its past lives, through its composition in tramp elements. Examples of heterotopia are a prison or a cemetery. The Circular Economy defines a space where a particular material/element exists in its various avatars, impersonations and reincarnations and this may tentatively be worked out as a heterotopia. This is a more complex endeavor than discussing the palimpsest metaphor, but a potentially more fruitful one. Foucault has provided criteria defining heterotopia which can help us explore the analogy: particularly the point that such a space is either a space of illusion or a space of perfection. This analysis is original because it hybridizes materials and SSH concepts and thus fits with the exploration of the frontier between materials and society that SAM conferences are concerned about.

AB In this study, applications of the Arduino platform in the mining industry were reviewed. Arduino, a representative and popular open-source hardware, can acquire information from various sensors, transmit data using communication technology, and control devices through actuators. The review was conducted by classifying previous studies into three types of Arduino applications: field monitoring systems, wearable systems, and autonomous systems. With regard to field monitoring systems, most studies in mines were classified as atmospheric or geotechnical monitoring. In wearable systems, the health status of the miner was an important consideration, in addition to the environmental conditions of the mine. Arduino can be a useful tool as an initial prototype for autonomous mine systems. Arduino has advantages in that it can be combined with various electronic products and is cost-effective. Therefore, although many studies have been conducted in the laboratory (as opposed to field tests), Arduino applications can be further expanded in the mining field in the future.

AB Background: Healthy plant-based diets rich in fermentable residues may induce gas-related symptoms. Our aim was to determine the potential of a fermented milk product with probiotics in improving digestive comfort with such diets. Methods: In an open design, a 3-day high-residue diet was administered to healthy subjects (n = 74 included, n = 63 completed) before and following 28 days consumption of a fermented milk product (FMP) containing Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis CNCM I-2494 and lactic acid bacteria. Main outcomes: digestive sensations, number of daytime anal gas evacuations, and gas volume evacuated during 4 h after a probe meal. Results: As compared to the habitual diet, the high-residue diet induced gas-related symptoms (flatulence score 4.9 vs. 1.2; p <= 0.0001), increased the daily number of anal gas evacuations (20.7 vs. 8.7; p < 0.0001), and impaired digestive well-being (1.0 vs. 3.4; p < 0.05). FMP consumption reduced flatulence sensation (by 1.7 [-1.9; -1.6]; p < 0.0001), reduced the number of daily evacuations (by -5.8 [-6.5; -5.1]; p < 0.0001), and improved digestive well-being (by +0.6 [+0.4; +0.7]; p < 0.05). FMP consumption did not affect the gas volume evacuated after a probe meal. Conclusion: In healthy subjects, consumption of a FMP containing B. lactis CNCM I-2494 and lactic acid bacteria improves the tolerance of a flatulogenic diet by subjective and objective criteria (sensations and number of anal gas evacuations, respectively).

AB The control of refrigeration in the food chain is fundamental at all stages, with special emphasis on the retail stage. The implementation of information and communication technologies (IoT, open-source hardware and software, cloud computing, etc.) is representing a revolution in the operational paradigm of food control. This paper presents a low-cost IoT solution, based on free hardware and software, for monitoring the temperature in refrigerated retail cabinets. Specifically, the use of the ESP-8266-Wi-Fi microcontroller with DS18B20 temperature sensors is proposed. The ThingSpeak IoT platform is used to store and process data in the cloud. The solution presented is robust, affordable, and flexible, allowing to extend the scope of supervising other relevant parameters in the operating process (light control, energy efficiency, consumer presence, etc.).

AB Phase microscopy allows stain-free imaging of transparent biological samples. One technique, using the transport of intensity equation (TIE), can be performed without dedicated hardware by simply processing pairs of images taken at known spacings within the sample. The resulting TIE images are quantitative phase maps of unstained biological samples. Therefore, spatially resolved optical path length (OPL) information can also be determined. Using low-cost, open-source hardware, we applied the TIE to living algal cells to measure their effect on OPL. We obtained OPL values that were repeatable within species and differed by distinct amounts depending on the species being measured. We suggest TIE imaging as a method of discrimination between different algal species and, potentially, non-biological materials, based on refractive index/OPL. Potential applications in biogeochemical modelling and climate sciences are suggested.

AB The open phenomenon coming from the free-software movement has gained several fields, including services, digital and physical products. Nevertheless, some authors point out the limited availability of supporting methods and online tools to face the challenges of distributed collaboration of volunteers. They claim that online collaborative platforms are still needed for supporting co-creation. In this paper, we investigate the deliberation and design rationale in an (open) design process using the OpenDesign Platform. A case study conducted with 22 participants of a Conference illustrates the use of the platform to cope with a proposed design challenge. Results illustrated with graphical representations based on concepts of the Actor Network Theory provide a visual representation of the network constituted by both the participants and the artifacts (boundary objects) they produce and interpret. Further studies are pointed out suggesting new possibilities of features and platform enhancements.

AB Some of the earliest applications of proof assistants were to correctness of digital hardware designs, but the subject doesn't come up too frequently today at venues like CPP. I will try to make the case that proof assistants are a crucial tool for resolving both classical problems and new ones at the hardware-software interface. That is, it is important to understand exactly what guarantees a processor exports to software, it is important to verify that hardware exports those guarantees correctly, and it is important to prove end-to-end theorems covering both hardware and software. A few social developments make this an exciting time to tackle these problems: open instruction sets and open-source hardware designs are growing in real-world relevance, and surprising new classes of security vulnerabilities have gotten more practitioners thinking about precise hardware-software contracts. I will sketch the state of the research area and go into detail on a few of my own related projects. An ancillary goal is to convey that programming or proving digital hardware is a lot like programming or proving software, with a few fun distinctions, so more of the CPP crowd might want to give it a try!

AB Front-end designs of OS-powered SoCs are developed to be implemented on SRAM-based FPGAs, which can be used in low-cost space applications. In this work, we evaluate the impact of OS on the reliability of a RISC-V based SoC, against configuration memory upsets. The results show that these upsets in the presence of OS barely affect the number of silent data corruptions, whereas the single event functional interruption rate increases about 3.6 times as compared to the bare-metal program execution. We also conclude that single event functional interruption rate due to configuration memory upsets show less dependence on the user application workload as compared to silent data corruption rates.

AB Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have found application in a broad range of domains due to their ability to massively exploit data parallelism and thereby achieve high energy efficiency, being now referred to as General-Purpose GPUs (GPGPUs). However, with a market dominated by two or three industrial players and a lack of open-source hardware realizations and standardized GPU Instruction-Set Architectures (ISAs), the full potential of these architectures for academic research and use by small hardware development enterprises remains far from being unlocked. In this paper, we start by discussing a few exciting research directions in GPGPU architectures and the benefits of open-source Hardware realizations. Furthermore, we show how our open-source FGPU core can be used to enable overcoming these challenges and contribute to the agile development of Domain-Specific Architectures (DSAs) featuring System-on-Chip (SoC) platforms extended with adapted GPGPU cores. FGPU is described in VHDL, can be programmed in OpenCL by use of our LLVM-based compiler, and has been validated against an ARM Cortex A9 with NEON support, achieving 4x performance improvement in fixed and floating-point benchmarks.

AB Farmers need smart tools to optimize their crops and production. They need other agricultural experts such as advisors, accounting companies and also systems and software tools for decision support. The proposed solution is a fuzzy decision support Environment for smart farming (Decifarm) intended to ensure better data structuration extracted from farms, automated calculations, reducing the risk of missing operations, while ensuring data security. We designed a modular architecture to carry out these problems: we first provide crops phenological stages from both historical and forecast weather open data as well as historical data from sensors previously implemented, located at the parcels, with large amounts of data stored into a No-SQL document database; second, we provide control of an automatic water system based on fuzzy logic; finally, a prototype of hardware and software environments was designed from open hardware components, open source languages and open data, promoting both interoperability and extensibility.

AB This paper presents a humanoid torso robot, named Woody. It has two arms, each with five degrees of freedom (DoF) and a 2-DoF neck supporting the head with two moving eyebrows. Woody's hardware is made primarily from laser-cut plywood. Two cameras, a microphone, a speaker, and a microprocessor board are embedded in the robot. The processor board also contains a wireless communication module for remote control and access to networked or cloud-based resources. The interactive functions include face tracking, facial emotion recognition, and several pre-programmed default gestures. Woody's graphical user interface (GUI) provides its users with instructions on hardware construction and initial setup. Through this GUI, the user can also program the robot and record new gestures by its motion recording function. Woody is developed as an open-source hardware platform that can also utilize open-source software for educational purposes.

DE Embedded Systems; Hardware Snapshotting; Security Analysis; Symbolic
   Execution
AB Advanced dynamic analysis techniques such as fuzzing and Dynamic Symbolic Execution (DSE) are a cornerstone of software security testing and are becoming popular with embedded systems testing. Testing software in a virtual machine provides more visibility and control. VM snapshots also save testing time by facilitating crash reproduction, performing root cause analysis and avoiding re-executing programs from the start.
   However, because embedded systems are very diverse virtual machines that perfectly emulate them are often unavailable. Previous work therefore either attempt to model hardware or perform partial emulation (forwarding interaction to the real hardware), which leads to inaccurate or slow emulation. However, such limitations are unnecessary when the whole design is available, e.g., to the device manufacturer or on open hardware.
   In this paper, we therefore propose a novel approach, called HardSnap, for co-testing hardware and software with a high level of introspection. HardSnap aims at improving security testing of hardware/software co-designed systems, where embedded systems designers have access to the whole HW/SW stack. HardSnap is a virtual-machine-based solution that extends visibility and controllability to the hardware peripherals with a negligible overhead. HardSnap introduces the concept of a hardware snapshot that collects the hardware state (together with software state). In our prototype, Verilog hardware blocks are either simulated in software or synthesized to an FPGA. In both cases, HardSnap is able to generate HW/SW snapshot on demand. HardSnap is designed to support new peripherals automatically, to have high performance, and full controllability and visibility on software and hardware. We evaluated HardSnap on open-source peripherals and synthetic firmware to demonstrate improved ability to find and diagnose security issues.

AB An important field of research within mechatronics includes the development of robotic platforms based on open source platforms, primarily focused on the operating system ROS (Robot Operating System). The main disadvantage regarding commercial robotic manipulators is based on the lack of flexibility in design, because constantly hardware is protected by copyright or partially released. There is a need to develop a platform that facilitates robotics teaching and learning focused on open hardware and software with industrial applications. For the development of the project, the mechatronic systems design methodology proposed in the VDI 2206 standard was used. As a result, an anthropomorphic Open Software and Open Hardware Robot (OSH-OSS) with six degrees of freedom were obtained with a precision of 2.03 [mm] and repeatability of +/-4.89 [mm], with a payload of 0.15 [kg] and a payload ratio of 5.21%. The proposal to replicate the manipulator within the subject of industrial robotics at the undergraduate level proved to improve the technical performance of the participants, facilitating the learning and the assimilation of complex concepts to acquire theoretically.

AB This article argues for the exploration of and experimentation with the potentials of civic technoscience as a way of materializing counterdominant practices in human-rights activism that may challenge conventional uses of technology and rooted understandings of expertise. It examines the Ground Truth project, which addresses the Palestinian-Bedouin struggle for indigenous rights in the Naqab desert, in the southern region of Israel/Palestine. It focuses on the use of do-it-yourself (DIY) aerial photography with balloons and kites, alongside other collaborative practices, for mapping and visualizing Bedouin political and spatial claims. Against a backdrop of increasingly technologically savvy legal-professional cultures in human-rights organizations, this article proposes that a community-based DIY approach to truth making may challenge entrenched thresholds of participation and open opportunities for creating hybrid forums in the human-rights field. Finally, it suggests that civic technoscience can offer an experimental ground for training oneself in critical ways of thinking and engaging with technology.

AB This work presents InfiniWolf, a novel multi-sensor smartwatch that can achieve self-sustainability exploiting thermal and solar energy harvesting, performing computationally high demanding tasks. The smartwatch embeds both a System-on-Chip (SoC) with an ARM Cortex-M processor and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Mr. Wolf, an open-hardware RISC-V based parallel ultra-low-power processor that boosts the processing capabilities on board by more than one order of magnitude, while also increasing energy efficiency. We demonstrate its functionality based on a sample application scenario performing stress detection with multi-layer artificial neural networks on a wearable multi-sensor bracelet. Experimental results show the benefits in terms of energy efficiency and latency of Mr. Wolf over an ARM Cortex-M4F micro-controllers and the possibility, under specific assumptions, to be self-sustainable using thermal and solar energy harvesting while performing up to 24 stress classifications per minute in indoor conditions.

AB A data visualization proposition for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is presented in this paper. WSNs play a pivotal role in the composition of Internet of Things (IoT) systems. In an IoT system, the data accumulated by nodes with distinct sensors can be used to monitor environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity. With this data, efforts can be taken to improve the comfort of people in these environments. There exist circumstances where directly connecting the data collected in the WSNs to the Internet may not always be economic efficient. Moreover, we propose a scheme that utilizes both open source hardware and software for data collection at the nodes of a WSN where it is visualized using an online IoT platform known as ThingsBoard.

AB In this work, we challenge the concept of design in the development of information systems. Information systems are usually considered to be so complex systems that they simply cannot be developed outside of a specific activity of planning. However, in the specialized literature, some voices have also been raised saying that it is this situated and contingent complexity that always prevents information systems from having been really effectively designed. These voices have so far criticized the formal and methodical approaches in IS design, and not design itself, thus exonerating the role of the modernist designer from the current rate of failure and user dissatisfaction in IT projects. The current idea of designer has reinforced over time a divide between modeling and practicing, design and use, and the hegemony of the planning mind over that of the performer. The current convergence of networked application paradigms and theWeb 2.0 infrastructure has led to agile methods, open design concepts and on the idea of a prosuming user. This paper outlines some discourses in IS research that could challenge the more traditional ones in current IT design, and argues about the importance to revamp some of the most important socio-technical principles for maintaining a critical gaze on positivistic and automation stances, mitigating the effects of the modernist over-design attitude, and make IS development more sustainable.

AB Attitudes complement knowledge and skills but are often overlooked as assessable competencies in higher education. In architectural design curriculum, attitudes are especially relevant in order to ensure the training of responsible designers. As humanistic and environmental approaches are increasingly at the forefront, the studio cultures of the schools seek to cultivate collaborative and participatory skills on individual creativity. The parallel acclaim of computational methods expounds the reasoning processes of design and new opportunities arise for open and liable cultures of design. However, the task of connecting these methods to a broader competency in design is still not fulfilled. This paper provides an interdisciplinary context for accountability as an attitude in design education and a conceptual framework for implementing and assessing it through computational methods. It argues that computation in early-design education, in the form of shape rules and devices of visual computing, is supportive in instilling reflective attitudes by promoting knowledge sharing with accountability among learners.

AB The sowing-fertilizing machines used in the mexican field use mechanical systems to drive the feeders. In developed countries, these systems are being replaced by mechatronic systems applied in variable dosing machines. Mechatronic systems have the advantage that their performance is not affected by the conditions of the soil and vegetation cover, in addition to the ease of making changes in the dose of input supplies, by allowing them to be carried out continuously and in real time. However, they have the disadvantage of their high acquisition cost. This study presents the laboratory test results of a mechatronic system developed with low-cost free hardware and software, and adapted to the Model LC-U-N seeder-fertilizer from the manufacturer Sembradoras del Bajio S. A de C. V. The seed dispenser was tested to the standard of the corn seed greased belt described in ISO 7256-1:1984. The results show good seed distribution quality at rotation frequencies of the seed disk of 0.524 to 2,199 rad s(-1), obtaining feeding quality indexes a 90%, seed loss and multiplicity less than 6 % and precision <18 %. The fertilizer and pesticide dispensers were tested based on the mexican standard NMX-0-222-SCFI-2004, with commercial UREA fertilizer, using five rotation frequencies in the range of 0.524 to 3.77 rad s(-1) and 1047 to 14,661 rad s(-1), respectively, with different openings of the outlet gate. In the case of the fertilizer dispenser, an application dose of 3 to 562 kg ha(-1) was obtained with the best performance when using gate openings 50 %, while the pesticide dispenser presented excellent performance, with which it was obtained an application rate of 0.004 to 16.4 kg ha(-1).

AB In his book Tools for Conviviality (1975), Ivan Illich calls for human self-limitation in technology development. His aim is neither environmental protection nor the prevention of unforeseen side-effects of technology development, but the comprehensibility of technologies' operating principles for the user. For if the construction or repairing of tools requires expert knowledge inaccessible to the public, this necessarily entails social imbalances in power. In a similar manner, Bernard Stiegler conceives the delegation of know-how to technological systems as a kind of proletarianization that ultimately may result in a loss of savoir-vivre. Without sweepingly rejecting the division of labour, automation or specialized knowledge, practices of commoning respond to such diagnoses: free software like GNU/Linux or open hardware largely succeed in unlinking the expert knowledge that advanced computing doubtlessly requires from problematic power effects. From this perspective, proprietary algorithms are problematic, as their lack of transparency prevents conviviality. This also holds for the practices of data aggregation and extraction which steadily increase the information gap between platform providers and users. An even more fundamental problem is posed by so-called "self-learning", i.e., recursively adapting, algorithms: it is not clear how and to what extent the knowledge and instructions generated by "artificial intelligence" can be traced and reconstructed by human insight. Thus, we are confronted with a situation of potentially non-recoverable proletarianization and non-conviviality that exposes a renewed urgency of Illich's considerations concerning technological self-limitation.

AB Local councils, power and road agencies have tens of thousands of assets such as road signs, power poles, and public artworks. Asset management plans dictate that these assets need to be inspected periodically, for example once per year. In between inspections the assets are vulnerable to random events such as weather and adverse human interactions. Asset managers need to know when these events occur, as damage to these assets can impact public safety. Traditional instrumentation for this high volume, low asset value application has been too costly to install. This paper presents a low cost design and associated edge-processing strategy to enable low-power transmission of a vibration signal notifying of change in state of an asset. The design is demonstrated using a COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) microcontroller, MEMS (microelectromechanical system) accelerometer and a LoRa (Long Range spread spectrum modulation technique) module. We name our device RAMI (Remote Asset Management Indicator). The design draws less than 1 mA in normal operation, lasts over a year between battery changes, costs less than AU$100 (US$65) to construct and can transmit around 400 metres in an urban setting and up to 3 km in a rural setting. The open-source design and code are available for download. (C) Copyright 2020 The Authors.

AB Damaging UV radiation is an important object of investigation related to its impact on biological species. Data acquired at high-altitude stations reveal dangerous events of incident UV radiation reaching the Earth surface. Continuous multi-UV spectral measurements by open-source equipment could further deepen the knowledge of solar light propagation and the events of radiation transfer and atmospheric absorption processes. This report describes recent results on high-resolution UVA, UVB, UVC measurements of solar UV radiation at the mountain stations in Bulgaria.

AB Although telephony over IP protocol has more than a decade among us, the ubiquity of the Internet, new open hardware technologies, free software and cloud platforms invite us to rethink a solution in this new context. As such a solution is proposed in this project to Rill, made up of a small team to be installed in customer premises and an automatic provisioning system and telephone switching in the cloud. The main challenge for obtaining such a product was the large number of hardware and software components to be integrated, passing points as diverse as a Raspberry with its Grandstream interface adapter, Asterisk with its trunk and protocol contexts, platforms such as AWS and Docker. It is important to highlight that the stated objectives were achieved, obtaining a functional, resilient and scalable solution where complexity is centralized in the components hosted in the cloud. In this way, the benefits of virtualization and consolidation in the cloud have been extended to telephony in recent years. Finally, all the software components of the system are either free open source projects, or original developments by the authors of the same.

AB This paper presents results from an experiment using electroencephalography to measure neurophysiological activations of mechanical engineers and industrial designers when designing and problem-solving. In this study, we adopted and then extended the tasks described in a previous functional magnetic resonance imaging study reported in the literature. The block experiment consists of a sequence of three tasks: problem-solving, basic design and open design using a physical interface. The block is preceded by a familiarizing pre-task and then extended to a fourth open design task using free-hand sketching. This paper presents the neurophysiological results from 36 experimental sessions of mechanical engineers and industrial designers. Results indicate significant differences in activations between the problem-solving and the open design tasks. The paper focuses on the two prototypical tasks of problem-solving layout and open design sketching and presents results for both aggregate and temporal activations across participants within each domain and across domains.

AB This research studied the feasibility in applying the flight controller of the unmanned aerial vehicle on a pontoon boat in fish farming industry. A small-scale autonomous pontoon boat has been built, equipped with the open-hardware flight controller, GPS receiver, Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) and the magnetometer.
   A 2(3) factorial design based on Design of Experiment (DOE) is carried out to study the influence of three parameters (turn_rate, turn_angle and damping) on the response variable (peak-to-peak deviation from the desired trajectory). Total 24 experiments have been conducted by setting the desired trajectory as a circle with diameter 20 m. The peak-to-peak deviation in each experiment has been observed.
   The analyses revealed that the damping has low interaction with the turn angle and turn rate while there is a stronger interaction between the turn angle and turn rate. And the peak-to-peak deviation of the trajectory tends to decrease when the parameter damping was set to high value. The regression model has been derived and plotted as a response surface. The optimized parameters were selected from the plot and perform the experiment with three replications. The results confirm that parameters tuning has improved the performance of the boat significantly.
   With the DOE approach, the impact of two or more parameters on a response, the interaction between parameters can be investigated systematically. This approach is an effective way to tuning the parameters and can be applied to various kinds of the autonomous vehicle.

AB Knowledge management (KM) is the process of creating, sharing, using and managing the knowledge and information of an organization . In this paper, we investigate KM practices and needs in Open Source Hardware (OSH) communities. The aim is to provide insights into the KM issues and challenges facing these communities. Our analysis is based on interviews carried out with the participants of 22 projects. Interview transcriptions were coded and tagged with concepts extracted from the literature. Text mining was used to uncover the main concepts embedded in the corpus. From this analysis, knowledge sharing emerged as one of the top-rated concepts. Codification and personalization also proved to be important KM approaches, both requiring support in the OSH design process. Using a dendrogram, we highlighted the benefits and challenges of codification together with some interesting concept associations. High contributor turnover, little or no standardization and weak project structuring are still key challenges for OSH communities when it comes to ensuring awareness, making decisions and sharing knowledge.

DE Deep Learning; Obstacle Avoidance; Autonomous Robotics
AB Obstacle avoidance is an essential feature for autonomous robots. It is usually addressed with specialized sensors and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping algorithms (SLAM, Cadena et al. (2016)). Muller et al. (2006) have demonstrated that it can also be addressed using end-to-end deep learning. They proposed a convolutional neural network that maps raw stereo pair input images to steering outputs and is trained by a human driver in an outdoor setting. Using the ToyCollect open source hardware and software platform, we replicate their main findings, compare several variants of their network that differ in the way steering angles are represented, and extend their system to indoor obstacle avoidance. We discuss several issues for further work concerning the automated generation of training data and the quantitative evaluation of such systems.

AB This article presents the design and characterisation of a new low-power hardware platform to integrate unmanned aerial vehicle and wireless sensor technologies. In combination, these technologies can overcome data collection and maintenance problems of in situ monitoring in remote and extreme environments. Precision localisation in support of maximum efficiency mid-range inductive power transfer when recharging devices and increased throughput between drone and device are needed for data intensive monitoring applications, and to balance proximity time for devices powered by supercapacitors that recharge in seconds. The platform described in this article incorporates ultra-wideband technology to achieve high-performance ranging and high data throughput. It enables the development of a new localisation system that is experimentally shown to improve accuracy by around two orders of magnitude to 10 cm with respect to GNSS and achieves almost 6 Mbps throughput in both lab and field conditions. These results are supported by extensive modelling and analysis. The platform is designed for application flexibility, and therefore includes a wide range of sensors and expansion possibilities, with source code for two applications made immediately available as part of a open source project to support research and development in this new area.

ID POLICY
AB The paper provides an evolutionary model of industry development and learning within the wind power sector. Today this industry has attained a mature phase characterised by increased global competition, standardisation and stronger emphasis on process innovation. This leads to a greater emphasis on frugal innovation and on cost reduction strategies. The emerging and developing countries already account for 54% of global new investment in wind energy. Their share will continue to rise, particularly because of frugal design concepts and further efficiency improvements. The wind power sector also offers many opportunities for smart specialisation for new industry participants from emerging nations. Manufacturers from China, India, Brazil and several other countries have demonstrated successful strategies of industry development and international expansion. Brazil in particular represents a prototype case for developing wind power based on frugal design concepts. We have selected an illustrative case study of an advanced turbine blade manufacturer from Brazil, and on the interaction with foreign multinational firms. Finally, we also address learning processes in renewable energy policy. While feed-in tariffs often stimulate industry development during early phases, the transfer to an auctioning scheme tends to have a strong impact on price discipline and on frugal innovation.

DE Architecture; MOOC; Environments
AB In this paper, we apply instructional design theories and studies developed by different authors to investigate the environment, interface and multimedia design in a Connectivist Massive Online Open Course (cMOOC). Our objective was to verify and understand how the most open design, distributed among various digital spaces, contributed to optimize the student interaction process, communicative actions and agency during the teaching-learning process in a virtual space.
   According to Leffa and Fontana (2018), the engineering of a MOOC has the power to influence the interactions that occur in that digital space, in such way that the limited resources and rigidity of the platforms can shape the teaching-learning process. Like these authors, we understand that design architecture determines the affordances and limitations of the environment, modeling the agency of the student and the tutor, affecting the processes of teaching-learning, participation and dialogue.
   In the object analyzed, the course based its pedagogical project on openness of environment and connections, so it opted for a more open environment design, spread among portal, social networks, websites and blogs. The research revealed that this project of environment design and spread content required a more participative, autonomous, engaged participant, a student willing to interact and move among the different course environments. Due to such openness, since the course was spread over multiple platforms (portal, Twitter, Youtube, Discourse Forum, blogs etc.), students had to adopt many interactive tools and multimedia resources in order to interact, faster and more intensely with other members. In this analysis, has drawn our attention the way how the features, of these many interfaces, were integrated into learning, building a proposal for interaction that stimulated exploration, collaboration and communication.
   These findings of the analysis endorsed the observations of Timothy Read (2014), showing that the possibilities for agency and interaction in a MOOC course do not depends only on individuals' initiatives: they are shaped by the underlying structures, depending on the tools available on interfaces and MOOC platforms, which was applied (READ, 2014).
   We concluded that, since the Connected Courses course was not tied to a specific platform, it has achieved a more interactive and horizontal communication process, creating a network of collaboration and communication between tutors and students. Therefore, the findings of our analysis indicated that these outcomes were possible thanks to the affordances of the environment architecture and the more open environment design, which was fundamental to the participation, autonomy, agency, involvement and learning of students in cMOOC course.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Multi-/Many-core architectures are emerging as scalable, high-performance and energy-efficient computing platforms suitable for a variety of application domains from edge to cloud computing. Recently, the appearance of RISC-V open-source ISA creates new possibilities to develop customized computing platforms with high savings in the non-recurring engineering costs. Moreover, the current trends toward open-source hardware frameworks are aimed to reduce design time and cost for complex system-on-chip architectures. Therefore, modularity and re-usability of hardware components are major challenges for flexible hardware architectures. The motivation behind this work is to introduce a modular cluster-based many-core architecture for FPGA accelerators that is re-usable and flexible tailored to implement different many-core taxonomies with less design time and costs by using regular and replicated sets of computing, memory, and interconnection blocks. The proposed many-core architecture is built using multiple processing clusters coupled with a NoC for communication which allows a high degree of design scalability. The processing cluster inside features a configurable multi-core architecture consisting of multiple RISC-V processing elements (PE) tightly coupled with a bus-based interconnection for intra-cluster communication using parameterized scratchpad shared memory. Each PE features a single RISC-V core with a tightly coupled parameterized scratchpad local memory and generic AXI interface. Evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed architecture features a scalable computing performance of 501 MOp/s for 4 clusters and 878 MOp/s for 8 clusters. Moreover, a scalable memory bandwidth up to 4.3 GB/s is achieved for 9 clusters with a power consumption of 1.4 W per cluster utilizing 7.7% of on-chip memory resources. The many-core architecture is implemented and evaluated on Xilinx Virtex Ultrascale+ with the feature of changing the architecture configurations during run-time using dynamic and partial reconfiguration which provides more flexibility and re-usability.

AB Soil is the base of agriculture. Soil provides nutrients that increase the growth of a crop. Some chemical and physical properties of soil, such as its moisture, temperature and its pH, heavily affect the yield of a crop. These properties can be sensed by the open-source hardware, and they can be used in the field. In this chapter, a soil health monitoring system is proposed in which farmer will be able to monitor soil moisture, soil temperature and soil pH in his android smart-phone. The farmer will also get the recommendations of lime and sulphur on the basis of pH of the soil. The area of study is Jaipur, Rajasthan (26.9124 degrees N, 75.7873 degrees E). The proposed system is tested with the results taken from authorized laboratories. The proposed system is validated with t-test having no significance difference between calibrated values and laboratory-recorded values. The proposed system is implemented on android smartphone so it is useful for farmers, agriculture scientists, agriculture professionals and IoT experts.

AB The increased popularity of investigations and exploits in the fields of neurological rehabilitation, human emotion recognition, and other relevant brain-computer interfaces demand the need for fiexible electrophysiology data acquisition systems. Such systems often require to be multi-modal and multi-channel capable of acquiring and processing several different types of physiological signals simultaneously in realtime. Developments of modular and scalable electrophysiological data acquisition systems for experimental research enhance understanding and progress in the field. To contribute to such an endeavor, we present an open-source hardware project called High-Channel Count Electrophysiology or HiCCE, targeting to produce an easily-adaptable, cost-effective, and affordable electrophysiological acquisition system as an alternative solution for mostly available commercial tools and the current state of the art in the field. In this paper, we describe the design and validation of the entire chain of the HiCCE-128 electrophysiological data acquisition system. The system comprises of 128 independent channels capable of acquiring signal at 31.25 kHz, with 16 effective bits per channel with a measured noise level of about 3 fiV. The reliability and feasibility of the implemented system have been confirmed through a series of tests and real-world applications. The modular design methodology based on the FPGA Mezzanine Card (FMC) standard allows the connection of the HiCCE-128 board to programmable system-on-chip carrier devices through the high-speed FMC link. The implemented architecture enables end users to add various high-response electrophysiological signal processing techniques in the field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) part of the system on chip (SoC) device on each channel in parallel according to application specification.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to argue in favor of the open hardware philosophy (open-source hardware - OSH) as a technological innovation and academic entrepreneurshipmodel in Brazil.
   Design/methodology/approach - This argument is based on three pillars. The first one refers to a bibliographic review of theoretical frameworks related to academic entrepreneurship and technological innovation to emphasize the disruptive innovation capacity of academia. Second, a few elements related to the Brazilian political, economic and structural scenario, which entail a (more) favorable environment to technological innovation and academic entrepreneurship, is presented. Finally, concepts related to OSH and its business model are approached to demonstrate the facilitating effect toward the whole process.
   Findings - As a result of the argument made herein, it is possible to perceive the viability of the OSH model in terms of entrepreneurship and technological innovation in the academic sphere, and to perceive its benefits before social and economic needs in areas such as health and education.
   Research limitations/implications - There are no empirical or quantifiable data in the literature that enable comparison between OSH and traditional technological innovation models.
   Originality/value - The considerations on the philosophical value of OSH and its business models are scarcely explored in international literature. As far as we know, relating OSH to technological innovation entrepreneurship in the academic sphere, as well as its singularities in Brazil regarding the innovation national system and social and economic demands, is a unique approach in literature.

AB Heterogeneous architectures and heterogeneous-ISA designs are growing areas of computer architecture and system software research. Unfortunately, this line of research is significantly hindered by the lack of experimental systems and modifiable hardware frameworks. This work proposes BYOC, a "Bring Your Own Core" framework that is specifically designed to enable heterogeneous-ISA and heterogeneous system research. BYOC is an open-source hardware framework that provides a scalable cache coherence system, that includes out-of-the-box support for four different ISAs (RISC-V 32-bit, RISC-V 64-bit, x86, and SPARCv9) and has been connected to ten different cores. The framework also supports multiple loosely coupled accelerators and is a fully working system supporting SMP Linux. The Transaction-Response Interface (TRI) introduced with BYOC has been specifically designed to make it easy to add in new cores with new ISAs and memory interfaces. This work demonstrates multiple multi-ISA designs running on FPGA and characterises the communication costs. This work describes many of the architectural design trade-offs for building such a flexible system. BYOC is well suited to be the premiere platform for heterogeneous-ISA architecture, system software, and compiler research.

AB We propose an open source hardware platform called Blinky, a sound-to-light conversion sensor that harvests sound power at low-rate and conveniently. Blinkies are made up of a central processing unit connected to two microphones and a few light-emitting devices, are powered by a battery, and protected by a robust enclosure. Distributed in space and combined with a conventional video camera, they allow to practically sense sound power over a very large area without hassle. We give a comprehensive overview of the proposed system and its potential applications. We describe the hardware design and trade-offs made. We provide a model for the channel between sound power measurements and signal acquired by the video camera. Because each sensor is potentially affected by a different attenuation due to the channel, we propose a calibration procedure to restore the scale of the measurements. The effectiveness of the calibration is validated in an experiment. Finally, we demonstrate sound source localization using a hundred-and-one actual Blinkies in highly reverberent environment.

AB The internet of things is rapidly becoming a fact of life. There remain, however, various challenges with respect to the concept of Industry 4.0 before this new reality is fully integrated into the industrial sector. One such challenge is ensuring security, an essential issue in terms of both management and operational technology involving the configuration and administration of physical equipment. Another is integrating equipment from different manufacturers which must be configured and/or administered with incompatible protocols. Likewise, remote access to systems must be carried out from a browser in the web frame. This paper presents a set of tools, available as a cloud-based service, which facilitates access to the physical equipment located in a business. The access enables the end user to see and/or modify the configuration and management of data in a secure, controlled, organized and collaborative manner. In order to unify different protocols, the service makes use of the Modbus TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) protocol, one of the most commonly used by industry in local networks. The local Modbus communications are encapsulated in the Websocket protocol to make them accessible from the cloud. The tools proposed in this paper are based on open hardware platforms and free software, and they permit local and remote sensors and actuators to be fully and easily accessed.

AB Open-source designs are being increasingly used to develop robot hardware. When motor actuators were used for robot development in the past, it was difficult to find cost-effective commercial products. Open-source motor controllers, recently developed with the collaboration of many people, have exhibited phenomenal growth as their performance is now comparable to those of commercial products and their price is cheaper. In this study, we utilized an open-source Vedder electronic speed controller (VESC), originally developed for electric skateboards, as a general-purpose motor controller for robot control. The high-speed, high-torque, and high-output VESC was hardware-upgraded to enable more accurate current control, and advanced position and speed control algorithms were developed to produce Myongji-VESC (MJ-VESC), a general-purpose motor controller for multiaxis robot systems. To evaluate its current, speed, and position control performances, MJ-VESC was applied to an open-source planetary geared actuator that can be fabricated with a 3D printer. Based on this, we propose an open-source motor controller framework that can be universally used for multiaxis robot systems.

AB The success of many open source software projects revealed the power of voluntary collaborative production of large/complex software systems. The research community is therefore curious about the viability of open source projects in other areas. In around 2000, open source practices started to take place in the commercial hardware realm, and so far, the phenomenon has not been fully explored. Using grounded theory, the authors studied 31 firms for an average of 2.3 years, discovering a 4-phase growth pattern of open source hardware firms, including starting the firm, identifying core competencies, business model improvement and business maturation. The firms' behaviors in each stage are reported, as well as the evolution of community demography, behaviors and impact in different growth phases.

AB This paper presents results from an experiment to determine brain activation differences between problem-solving and designing of mechanical engineers. The study is part of a research project whose goal is to correlate design cognition with brain behavior across design domains. The study adopted and extended the tasks described in a fMRI study of design cognition and measured brain activation using EEG. By taking the advantage of EEG's temporal resolution we focus on time-related neural responses during problem-solving compared to design tasks. Statistical analyses indicate increased activation when designing compared to problem-solving. Results of time-related neural responses connected to Brodmann areas cognitive functions, contribute to a better understanding of mechanical engineers' cognition in open design tasks.

AB Across disciplines such as software engineering to architectural design, it is well acknowledged that the different types of information employed during the design process impacts the potential of the final design. However, a lack of understanding exists about how designers utilize and navigate the abundance of complex information types, making it difficult to develop design methodologies that support the development of competitive products and services. As part of an ongoing effort to develop an Information Archetypes Framework, this study focuses on identifying the emergence of information dimensions and archetypes during decision making. This was accomplished through a detailed analysis of interviews with designers who engage in open source work as part of their employment. The fmdings of this study provide empirical evidence of the types of information used during the design process, validates existing information archetypes, and identifies new archetypes that emerge from co-occurring information dimensions.

AB This paper introduces SiQAD, a computer-aided design tool enabling the rapid design and simulation of computational assemblies of atomic silicon quantum dots. SiQAD consists of several simulation tools: a ground state electron configuration finder, a non-equilibrium electron dynamics simulator, and an electric potential landscape solver for the exploration of field-driven modulation with electrodes. Simulations have been compared against past experimental results to inform the electron population estimation and dynamic behavior. Fundamental logic building blocks and circuits suitable for this platform have been designed and simulated, and a clocked wire has been demonstrated. This work paves the way and provides the first set of open design tools for the exploration of the emerging design space of atomic silicon quantum dot circuits.

AB Recent advancements in whole slide imaging (WSI) have moved pathology closer to digital practice. Existing systems require precise mechanical control, and the cost is prohibitive for most individual pathologists. Here we report a low-cost and high-throughput WSI system termed OpenWSI. The reported system is built using off-the-shelf components, including a programmable LED array, a photographic lens, and a low-cost computer numerical control (CNC) router. Different from conventional WSI platforms, our system performs real-time single-frame autofocusing using color-multiplexed illumination. For axial positioning control, we perform coarse adjustment using the CNC router and precise adjustment using the ultrasonic motor ring in the photographic lens. By using a 20X objective lens, we show that the OpenWSI system has a resolution of similar to 0.7 mu m. It can acquire whole slide images of a 225 mm(2) region in similar to 2 mins with throughput comparable to existing high-end platforms. The reported system offers a turnkey solution to transform the high-end WSI platforms into one that can be made broadly available and utilizable without loss of capacity.

AB Open source software (OSS) and hardware (OSH) are two expressions of one broader concept and its related movement. One of the most fundamental questions relating to these phenomena is why developers contribute their private resources to these public goods. While this question has been discussed, theorized, and empirically investigated in the context of OSS, there has been no research so far in the context of OSH. Can we really assume the motivations behind the development of the OSH to be the same as those behind OSS? Based on the self-determination theory (SDT), we provide original insights into the motivations behind contributions to OSH development. We collected data from the most common and active 3D printing communities, which are the main loci of OSH development. We thus have a unique cross-sectional data set with participants from over 30 different countries using all kinds of different OSH platforms. Our analysis reveals several important findings: firstly, the motivations are in some aspects very similar to those in open source software notwithstanding different possibilities, hurdles, and incentives regarding the OSS and OSH. Above all, enjoyment-based intrinsic motivation is a major factor affecting contribution levels. Secondly, among internalized extrinsic motivations, expected private benefits through improving own skills stands out. Thirdly, different factors of internalized extrinsic motivations can have different moderating effects on the effect of enjoyment-based intrinsic motivation. Given the imminent changes in business models throughout manufacturing industries in order to adapt to the challenge that OSH will increasingly pose, our findings have important implications not only for OSH communities and 3D development platforms, but also for businesses that want and probably soon have to engage in open innovation.

For emerging technologies, such as ambient ionization mass spectrometry (AIMS), the assembly of a functional prototype is often more time-consuming than developing the actual probes. The modification of commercial platforms for testing hardware is usually not possible due to technical and legal restrictions. Therefore, we designed a robotic platform, which is based on RepRap 3D-printer components, and therefore easy to adopt for custom set-ups. Adjustable rails in an aluminium frame construction facilitate the mounting of additional parts such as sensors, probes, or optical components. The Open LabBot uses industry-standard G-code for its control. Its simple syntax facilitates the programming of the movement. We developed two programs for the robot control and mass spectrometry imaging: "LABI-Imaging" for synchronizing the robot movements and MS data acquisition and "RmsiGUI", a software solution for the complete AIMS workflow. We proved the functionality of the system by the automated sampling and classification of essential oils with a PlasmaChip probe. Further, we performed an AIMSI imaging experiment of a lime slice with laser desorption low-temperature plasma (LD-LTP) ionization, demonstrating the integration of the complete workflow in RmsiGUI. The design of the Open LabBot and the software are released under open licenses to promote their use and adoption in the instrument developers' community.

DE Obstacles; Open design; The mass
AB Open design is a web-based digital manufacturing method for mass customization. It allows people to customize the products which designed by other designers, and send them to local factory to manufacture which can reduce the transportation pollution. Nowadays open design is emerging in China in the expert design field, but not popular, not even known by the masses. In order to understand what obstacles users face during using an Open Design platform, and how to promote Open Design, we invite 5 designers and 5 people from other occupations to simulate the open design product customize in an Open Design platform (http://www.downloadopendesign.com) founded by Enrique in Guangdong University of Technology. The stimulation is divided to different level tasks (from easy to hard) to understand the different reactions during the customization between two groups. After the stimulation, all people are interviewed for further knowledge about the different understanding of Open Design between designers and the others. Based on the experiment and interviews, we create a new prototype which not only includes open products but also more instructions and assistant services, and 5 more people were invited to test it and compare their reactions with the previous one. This research results can help designers to develop and promote a better adapted platform for the masses to use, and help designers to know that Open Design is not only a digital platform can serve designers but also can be a service for the masses to contribute their talents to their lives and the society.

AB The LI-COR 6400 portable photosynthesis system is the most widely used and cited instrument for measuring leaf gas exchange in plant physiology. The focus of this paper is to evaluate three ways of computing/measuring leaf temperature: the LI-COR energy budget computation, the LI-COR leaf thermocouple (T/C), and an infra-red (IR) sensor chip (MLX90615) incorporated into the LI-6400 leaf chamber. The IR-sensor was calibrated against known targets, and then used to cross check the other two methods. The results showed that the IR-sensor was superior to the LI-COR thermocouple and agreed closer with the energy budget values of leaf temperature. The magnitudes of the errors were quantified in terms of degrees C difference in leaf temperature measured by T/C (as control) and IR sensor versus percentage difference in stomatal conductance (g(s)) and intercellular CO2 concentration (C-i) computed from leaf temperature. The temperature difference (IR versus other methods) in the range of -1.89 to 1.58 degrees C resulted in relative errors in g(s) from 14.7% to -18.0% and C-i from 16.5% to -7.8% of the values reported by the standard LI-6400 calculations depending on species and temperature. Reasons are given for trusting the IR-sensor over the other methods and it is suggested that the next generation LI-COR photosynthesis system include an IR-sensor.

TI Parametric CAD modeling for open source scientific hardware: Comparing
   OpenSCAD and FreeCAD Python scripts
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID INNOVATION
AB Open source hardware for scientific equipment needs to provide source files and enough documentation to allow the study, replication and modification of the design. In addition, parametric modeling is encouraged in order to facilitate customization for other experiments. Parametric design using a solid modeling programming language allows customization and provides a source file for the design. OpenSCAD is the most widely used scripting tool for parametric modeling of open source labware. However, OpenSCAD lacks the ability to export to standard parametric formats; thus, the parametric dimensional information of the model is lost. This is an important deficiency because it is key to share the design in the most accessible formats with no information loss. In this work we analyze OpenSCAD and compare it with FreeCAD Python scripts. We have created a parametric open source hardware design to compare these tools. Our findings show that although Python for FreeCAD is more arduous to learn, its advantages counterbalance the initial difficulties. The main benefits are being able to export to standard parametric models; using Python language with its libraries; and the ability to use and integrate the models in its graphical interface. Thus, making it more appropriate to design open source hardware for scientific equipment.

AB In order to accelerate deployment of distributed recycling by providing low-cost feed stocks of granulated post-consumer waste plastic, this study analyzes an open source waste plastic granulator system. It is designed, built, and tested for its ability to convert post-consumer waste, 3D printed products and waste into polymer feedstock for recyclebots of fused particle/granule printers. The technical specifications of the device are quantified in terms of power consumption (380 to 404 W for PET and PLA, respectively) and particle size distribution. The open source device can be fabricated for less than $2000 USD in materials. The experimentally measured power use is only a minor contribution to the overall embodied energy of distributed recycling of waste plastic. The resultant plastic particle size distributions were found to be appropriate for use in both recyclebots and direct material extrusion 3D printers. Simple retrofits are shown to reduce sound levels during operation by 4dB-5dB for the vacuum. These results indicate that the open source waste plastic granulator is an appropriate technology for community, library, maker space, fab lab, or small business-based distributed recycling.

AB As conventional fluorescence microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy generally produce images with blurring at the upper and lower planes along the z-axis due to non-focal plane image information, the observation of biological images requires "deconvolution." Therefore, a microscope system's individual blur function (point spread function) is determined theoretically or by actual measurement of microbeads and processed mathematically to reduce noise and eliminate blurring as much as possible. Here the author describes the use of open-source software and open hardware design to build a deconvolution microscope at low cost, using readily available software and hardware. The advantage of this method is its cost-effectiveness and ability to construct a microscope system using commercially available optical components and open-source software. Although this system does not utilize expensive equipment, such as confocal and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopes, decent images can be obtained even without previous experience in electronics and optics.

AB In this article we present a new low-cost physiological signal acquisition platform in compliance with Open-Source Hardware philosophy. The device contains an electrocardiography circuit; two electrodermal activity channels that implement a time-multiplexing technique to remove inter-channel coupling interference; and a skin temperature module. These features make the platform suitable for experiments involving Affective Computing. We have assessed the performance of this device in terms of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Background Noise Level (BNL), an adapted MPEG7 feature for electrocardiography signals. This platform outperforms other commercial devices and most similar state-of-art studies on SNR. Results show values of 11.96, 30.01, 68.40 dB for ECG, EDA and ST, respectively, for SNR, and -28.31 dB for BNL in ECG. Both features were obtained by sampling physiological signals at a frequency of 256 Hz.

AB Although microscopes and image-analysis software for electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) have improved dramatically in recent years, specimen-preparation methods have lagged behind. Most strategies still rely on blotting microscope grids with paper to produce a thin film of solution suitable for vitrification. This approach loses more than 99.9% of the applied sample and requires several seconds, leading to problematic air-water interface interactions for macromolecules in the resulting thin film of solution and complicating time-resolved studies. Recently developed self-wicking EM grids allow the use of small volumes of sample, with nanowires on the grid bars removing excess solution to produce a thin film within tens of milliseconds from sample application to freezing. Here, a simple cryo-EM specimen-preparation device that uses components from an ultrasonic humidifier to transfer protein solution onto a self-wicking EM grid is presented. The device is controlled by a Raspberry Pi single-board computer and all components are either widely available or can be manufactured by online services, allowing the device to be constructed in laboratories that specialize in cryo-EM rather than instrument design. The simple open-source design permits the straightforward customization of the instrument for specialized experiments.

ID PROCESSOR
AB Industry is building larger, more complex, manycore processors on the back of strong institutional knowledge, but academic projects face difficulties in replicating that scale. To alleviate these difficulties and to develop and share knowledge, the community needs open architecture frameworks for simulation, chip design, and software exploration that support extensibility, scalability, and configurability, alongside an established base of verification tools and supported software. In this article, we present OpenPiton, an open source framework for building scalable architecture research prototypes from one core to 500 million cores. OpenPiton is the world's first open source, general-purpose, multithreaded manycore processor, and framework. OpenPiton is highly configurable, providing a rich design space spanning a variety of hardware parameters that researchers can change. OpenPiton designs can be emulated on FPGA5, where they can run full-stack multiuser Debian Linux. OpenPiton is designed to scale to very large core fabrics, enabling researchers to measure operating system, compiler, and software scalability. The mature code-base reflects the complexity of an industrial-grade design and provides the necessary scripts to build new chips, making OpenPiton a natural choice for computer-aided design (CAD) research. OpenPiton has been validated with a 25-core chip prototype, named Piton, and is bolstered by a validation suite that has thousands of tests, providing an environment to test new hardware designs while verifying the correctness of the whole system. OpenPiton is being actively used in research both internally to Princeton and in the wider community, as well as being adopted in education, industry, and government settings.

AB Large scale deployment of Smart Grids (SGs) and Smart Micro-Grids (SMGs) requires overcoming problems related to interoperability and high costs. To automate and monitor these challenging infrastructures, industrial equipment is used due to their reliability and versatility. In particular, Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are the prevalent automation units devoted to process control. They are combined with Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, responsible of acquiring and displaying operational data. One of the prominent trends to facilitate such deployment is the open source movement, being the Arduino microcontroller one of the most illustrative examples. This low-cost and community-supported platform is achieving increasing attention from academy and industry. However, there is still a need of integration frameworks to combine this device with reliable industrial equipment. This paper presents an approach that seamlessly integrates PLCs and Arduino platforms into a common SCADA system using the connectivity provided by Open Platform Communications (OPC). The open source device is devoted to sensing tasks. As a proof of concept, an application case has been carried out within the automation system of an experimental SMG, where the temperature of a PV panel is sensed and monitored. The developed system is described and successful results are reported.

AB Participatory design as one of the current approaches in the design research emerged with the demand for democracy at the intersection of the political agenda of the period and the dissemination of the technological infrastructure at workplaces. The participatory approach, first included in the design processes of the information systems, continued its existence as different practices focused on distinctive concerns due to its multidimensional structure that covers issues in political, economic and theoretical perspectives. The variety due to naming deficits of different practices and additional naming for the same practices have caused confusion in participatory design practice and terminology. The study aims to clarify this complexity by classifying the diversity which is the underlying causes of confusion. In this sense, the context of participation and the application areas of design were examined and the conditions that constitute the basis for different practices were investigated by literature review. According to their contextual dfferences, these different practices, grouped under collaborative design, open design and agonistic approach, were subjected to document analysis as projects. Content analysis categories are the variables taken from the evaluation framework set out in the previous section. As a result of this evaluation indicating the differences in the practices of the three approaches, both the classification was clarified and the effects of the contextual changes on the practices were put forward. Thus, while the results of the evaluation clarify terminology and practice, the evaluation framework guides the designer by emphasizing the points to be considered in practice.

The major purpose of this study is to evaluate the significance of integrating PBL and CL. The course creates capacities and abilities in critical thinking, problem-solving, independent learning, collaboration, and specialized technical information. Since PBL alone does not guarantee profoundly talented cooperation, it was supplemented with CL. This structure coordinated course substance and understudy pragmatic accomplishment in a reenacted learning environment. The understudies built a line following and Bluetooth-controlled robots by actualizing control programming on the "Arduino" open-source platform, just as utilizing remote interchanges as Arduino offers an instinctive advancement condition and different equipment and programming resources that permit quick improvement of microcontroller-based ventures. The basic findings of this study work reveal that teaching, learning, and student assessment processes can be improved by using PBL when integrated with CL. The research successfully extends onto another group of learners for preparing similar gadgets under different timelines. In addition, this paper also discusses upon the problem identification, selection of the equipment, circuit design, hardware mounting, and critical analysis of the results acquired from the course through the personal learning experience of the teachers as well as in the form of feedback from the two groups of young learners.

AB Tissue decellularization for generating extracellular matrices has become a staple of regenerative medicine in the recent decades, extending from the research setting to clinical usage. Although methods and protocols for tissue decellularization are abundant throughout the literature, they can be time intensive and typically require specific overhead in terms of equipment. To reduce these barriers to entry, a functional and reproducible prototype of a tissue infusion/perfusion device (TIPD) has been designed and fabricated using three-dimensional printed parts in conjunction with commercially available components. This TIPD forms a system composed of two peristaltic pumps, two 3-way valves, and a chamber in which tissue is contained, and is controlled by user-customizable software. To increase repeatability among decellularization protocols, an automation function has been integrated into the software, which is able to specify fluid flow rates and define specific valve locations enabling selection of solutions to be introduced into a scaffold over the course of a decellularization process. The prototype has been tested for proof of concept through infusion and perfusion decellularization of skeletal muscle and intact kidneys, respectively, and has shown successful removal of cellular content while maintaining an intact ultrastructure. In an effort to increase the reproducibility of experimental designs and to promote an open source hardware initiative in the field of tissue engineering, a novel device was conceptualized and prototyped with printable part files made available for its fabrication in tandem with instructions for assembly. Impact Statement Repeatable methods for decellularization are essential for achieving consistent substrates between batches, laboratories, and facilities. To meet this end, an automatable tissue infusion/perfusion device composed of three-dimensional printed parts and commercially available components has been prototyped and tested. Materials and instructions for its assembly have been made available in an effort to reduce variability among equipment as well as to provide a platform on which to iterate open-source hardware in tissue engineering.

AB Growth in open-source hardware designs combined with the low-cost of high performance optoelectronic and robotics components has supported a resurgence of in-house custom lab equipment development. We describe a low cost (below $700), open-source, fully customizable high-throughput imaging system for analytical microbiology applications. The system comprises a Raspberry Pi camera mounted on an aluminium extrusion frame with 3D-printed joints controlled by an Arduino microcontroller running open-source Repetier Host Firmware. The camera position is controlled by simple G-code scripts supplied from a Raspberry Pi singleboard computer and allow customized time-lapse imaging of microdevices over a large imaging area. Open-source OctoPrint software allows remote access and control. This simple yet effective design allows high-throughput microbiology testing in multiple formats including formats for bacterial motility, colony growth, microtitre plates and microfluidic devices termed 'lab-on-a-comb' to screen the effects of different culture media components and antibiotics on bacterial growth. The open-source robot design allows customization of the size of the imaging area; the current design has an imaging area of similar to 420 x 300mm, which allows 29 'lab-on-a-comb' devices to be imaged which is equivalent 3480 individual 1 mu l samples. The system can also be modified for fluorescence detection using LED and emission filters embedded on the PiCam for more sensitive detection of bacterial growth using fluorescent dyes.

AB Purpose This paper aims to propose an integrated methodology for evaluating academic spin-offs (ASOs) for supporting both the development phase and performance evaluation. The ASOs have peculiar characteristics compared to other start-up companies and the debate on their evaluation is still open. Design/methodology/approach The proposed methodology, adopting a lean approach, faces the typical problems that characterize the growth of an ASO: the excessive attention to the technological aspects with respect to the commercial and managerial ones; and the need for evaluation systems that try to evaluate all risk areas and to highlight any misalignment. The methodology was built also starting from the results of an Erasmus + research project, co-funded by the European Commission, called spin-off lean acceleration. Findings The methodology proposes to monitor the main risk areas (market, technological, implementation, governance and financial). For each of these areas, at first, a framework and a checklist are proposed for supporting the qualitative assessment of the potential of each areas. In the second part, a set of metrics for monitoring the performances and to understand if the spinoff is developing in the right direction is proposed. Moreover, the methodology was applied to the spin-offs at the University of Calabria (Italy), and the paper reports the first results obtained. Originality/value A new canvas model (lean acceleration canvas), more specific and suited to the context of ASOs, was developed and tested. A lean approach has been adopted also for understanding the weakness of traditional methods. The proposed methodology could be used by the technology transfer offices in their institutional activity of supporting ASOs.

AB The efficient investigation of integrated photonic and superconducting circuitry relies on the flexible design of masks for the lithography steps. While commercial software packages for high-end design are commonly employed, for scientific users, such software systems are often financially exclusive and thus custom solutions are needed. Here we present a flexible open source Python framework that allows mask generation of integrated circuitry by easy-to-learn Python scripting. The framework is designed to facilitate the design of new photonic building blocks, since it allows defining the geometry by reusing existing parts or direct design using geometric objects. Through the use of existing and user-defined building blocks, complex integrated circuits can be created in a convenient fashion. We illustrate the capabilities of the framework by realizing hybrid nanophotonic-superconducting circuits, as well as hybrid 2D-3D nanophotonic circuits through multi-step nanofabrication. Because all design parameters can be defined by the user, the framework is not limited to a particular platform and can rapidly be adapted for new applications.

AB This paper presents an intelligent electronic device (IED) utilized for automatic meter readings (AMR) scheme using "Open-Source" software. This IED is utilized to measure a low-voltage intelligent electronic device) system with a boundless number of sensors, and it is accessible on the Internet of Things (IoT). The utilized equipment for this task is Arduino UNO R3 motherboard and fringe sensors, which are used for measurement of the referenced information. The Arduino motherboard is used not only for sole tranquility of equipment but also for serving as wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) switch for the sensors. The personal computer is utilized to gather information and perform client-side calculations. The server works based on an open-source program written in Java programming language. The underlying objective of the proposed scheme is to make the meter based on the "Do It Yourself" methodology which requires considerably fewer funds. Also, it is conceivable by keeping easy to understand interface, information legitimacy, precision of measured information and convenience for the conclusive client. The information is measured in just about 1 ms which is superb for custom-designed IED. Furthermore, the measured qualities are calculated based on their RMS values to be used for analyzing and further presentation of data.

AB A wide range of medical devices have significant electronic components. Compared to open-source medical software, open (and open-source) electronic hardware has been less published in peer-reviewed literature. In this review, we explore the developments, significance, and advantages of using open platform electronic hardware for medical devices. Open hardware electronics platforms offer not just shorter development times, reduced costs, and customization; they also offer a key potential advantage which current commercial medical devices lack-seamless data sharing for machine learning and artificial intelligence. We explore how various electronic platforms such as microcontrollers, single board computers, field programmable gate arrays, development boards, and integrated circuits have been used by researchers to design medical devices. Researchers interested in designing low cost, customizable, and innovative medical devices can find references to various easily available electronic components as well as design methodologies to integrate those components for a successful design.

AB In recent years, substantial resources have been invested in researching and describing the enactment of "core practices" of teaching in teacher education. This review of the literature examined more than 40 articles published between 2008 and August 2018 in an effort to determine how teacher educators are supporting teacher candidates to learn about and enact core practices of teaching. The review of the literature presented here demonstrates two distinct approaches that teacher educators use to introduce and prepare teacher candidates to enact core practices: a predesigned enactment approach and an open-design enactment approach. Our goal in identifying these two approaches is to illuminate the role and actions of teacher educators in core-practice work and to demonstrate that the decisions teacher educators make in core-practice work are complex and nuanced, and require further description than heretofore available.

AB Physiological sensors can be used to detect changes in the emotional state of users with affective computing. This has lately been applied in the educational domain, aimed to better support learners during the learning process. For this purpose, we have developed the AICARP (Ambient Intelligence Context-aware Affective Recommender Platform) infrastructure, which detects changes in the emotional state of the user and provides personalized multisensorial support to help manage the emotional state by taking advantage of ambient intelligence features. We have developed a third version of this infrastructure, AICARP.V3, which addresses several problems detected in the data acquisition stage of the second version, (i.e., intrusion of the pulse sensor, poor resolution and lowsignal to noise ratio in the galvanic skin response sensor and slow response time of the temperature sensor) and extends the capabilities to integrate new actuators. This improved incorporates a new acquisition platform(shield) called PhyAS (Physiological Acquisition Shield), which reduces the number of control units to only one, and supports both gathering physiological signalswith better precision and delivering multisensory feedback with more flexibility, by means of new actuators that can be added/discarded on top of just that single shield. The improvements in the quality of the acquired signals allow better recognition of the emotional states. Thereof, AICARP.V3 gives a more accurate personalized emotional support to the user, based on a rule-based approach that triggers multisensorial feedback, if necessary. This represents progress in solving an open problem: develop systems that perform as effectively as a human expert in a complex task such as the recognition of emotional states.

AB Heart rate data are often collected in human factors studies, including those into vehicle automation. Advances in open hardware platforms and off-the-shelf photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensors allow the non-intrusive collection of heart rate data at very low cost. However, the signal is not trivial to analyse, since the morphology of PPG waveforms differs from electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms and shows different noise patterns. Few validated open source available algorithms exist that handle PPG data well, as most of these algorithms are specifically designed for ECG data.
   In this paper we present the validation of a novel algorithm named HeartPy, useful for the analysis of heart rate data collected in noisy settings, such as when driving a car or when in a simulator. We benchmark the performance on two types of datasets and show that the developed algorithm performs well. Further research steps are discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In order to provide dynamic adaptation of the performance/energy tradeoff, systems today rely on heterogeneous multicore architectures (different micro-architectures on a chip). These systems are limited to single-ISA approaches to enable transparent migration between the different cores. To offer more tradeoff, we can integrate statically scheduled micro-architecture and use dynamic binary translation (DBT) for task migration. However, in a system where performance and energy consumption are a prime concern, the translation overhead has to be kept as low as possible. In this paper, we present Hybrid-DBT, an open-source, hardware accelerated DBT system targeting VLIW cores. Three different hardware accelerators have been designed to speed-up critical steps of the translation process. Experimental study shows that the accelerated steps are two orders of magnitude faster than their software equivalent. The impact on the total execution time of applications and the quality of generated binaries are also measured.

AB Due to the rapid increase in the elderly population and single-person households, it is absolutely necessary to observe the indoor activities of marginalized people, such as the elderly or the disabled, to detect abnormal conditions. At this time, contact sensors are have limited applicability due to their continuous wear, so there is a need to develop technology to collect daily life activities of the elderly. In this study, we tried to track the elderly living alone using images obtained from an open source camera. The system captures images by linking a low-cost camera module to open source hardware, and an algorithm is implemented to detect falls. This system can be used to reduce the cost of social care by improving the cost of care in the aging population, and this will contribute to promoting and developing management prescription guidelines through risk detection.

AB Quality assurance detectors comprising cameras and a scintillator volume are of interest for use in spot scanning proton therapy due to its dynamic delivery. In this work, we aimed to image scanned proton beams with greater flexibility than is provided by previous systems by using an innovative camera triggering solution. The main objective was to synchronize image acquisitions with proton beam deliveries. A 3D detector composed of 3 scientific complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor cameras and a volumetric liquid scintillator (20 x20x 20 cm) were used. We identified relevant signals from the synchrotron beam delivery system to trigger the cameras. These signals were processed using an open hardware microcontroller and monitored using an oscilloscope. We evaluated the camera triggering scheme by comparing the mean signal intensity and standard deviations for triggered versus non-triggered image acquisitions at 5 energies (161.6, 140.9, 124.0, 100.9, and 85.6 MeV) with 50 spots per energy. The performance of the triggering scheme was further investigated by testing the image intensity variability for 5 energies delivered at 9 different location (2 spots/location). We also measured the background signals for different exposure times (1-1000 ms) using both triggered and non-triggered schemes. The mean signal intensity difference between triggered and non-triggered schemes was 10% +/- 0.4% for low SNR (similar to 20 dB). The image intensity variability was within 2%. The background signal intensity varied by only 0.6% from the shortest exposure time (1 ms) to the longest (1 s). We demonstrated a flexible triggering scheme using an open hardware microcontroller with a camera and scintillator detector system for a spot scanning proton beam, which will enable efficient machine quality assurance and treatment plan verification measurements in the future.

AB This work demonstrates an open-source hardware and software platform for monitoring the performance of buildings, called Elemental, that is designed to provide data on indoor environmental quality, energy usage, HVAC operation, and other factors to its users. It combines: (i) custom printed circuit boards (PCBs) with RFM69 frequency shift keying (FSK) radio frequency (RF) transceivers for wireless sensors, control nodes, and USB gateway, (ii) a Raspberry Pi 3B with custom firmware acting as either a centralized or distributed backhaul, and (iii) a custom dockerized application for the backend called Brood that serves as the director software managing message brokering via Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol using VerneMQ, database storage using InfluxDB, and data visualization using Grafana. The platform is built around the idea of a private, secure, and open technology for the built environment. Among its many applications, the platform allows occupants to investigate anomalies in energy usage, environmental quality, and thermal performance via a comprehensive dashboard with rich querying capabilities. It also includes multiple frontends to view and analyze building activity data, which can be used directly in building controls or to provide recommendations on how to increase operational efficiency or improve operating conditions. Here, we demonstrate three distinct applications of the Elemental platform, including: (1) deployment in a research lab for long-term data collection and automated analysis, (2) use as a full-home energy and environmental monitoring solution, and (3) fault and anomaly detection and diagnostics of individual building systems at the zone-level. Through these applications we demonstrate that the platform allows easy and virtually unlimited datalogging, monitoring, and analysis of real-time sensor data with low setup costs. Low-power sensor nodes placed in abundance in a building can also provide precise and immediate fault-detection, allowing for tuning equipment for more efficient operation and faster maintenance during the lifetime of the building.

DT Editorial Material
AB What is 'open design' and who gets to say what it is? In the emerging body of literature on open design, there is a clear alignment to the values and practices of free culture and open source software and hardware. Yet this same literature includes multiple, sometimes even contradictory strands of technology practice and research. These different perspectives can be traced back to free culture advocates from the 1970s to the 1990s who formulated the ideal of the internet as inherently empowering, democratizing, and countercultural. However, more recent approaches include feminist and critical interventions into hacking and making as well as corporate strategies of "open innovation" that bring end-users and consumers into the design process. What remains today seems to fall into two schools of thought. On one hand, we have the celebratory endorsements of 'openness' as applied to technology and design. On the other hand, we have a continuous and expanding critique of these very ideals and questions, where that critique identifies persisting forms of racial, gender, age, and class-based exclusions, and questions about the relationship between open design, labor and power remain largely unanswered.

DT Review
ID PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; INNOVATION; COMMUNITY; KNOWLEDGE; SUSTAINABILITY;
   NETWORKING; SOFTWARE; CREATION
AB This study reports on the results of a systematic literature review on 'open design' in academic fields including and beyond design and HCI. The review investigates how studies are framed as open design and open-source design (including 'open hardware'): how researchers contribute to conceptual theorizing about open design or study its practical operationalization, in do-it-yourself 'making,' manufacturing and practices in-between these domains. Most of the papers reviewed were empirical studies from diverse fields. Open design was analyzed not only as contributions and solutions, but also as open-to-participate processes, openly shared processes, and open, closed, and modular (open and closed) outcomes. Various research fields presented an open design framing as an alternative to the status quo: new ways to do business and/or to foster socio-environmental sustainability. On the manufacturing side, open design was sought especially to accelerate innovation cycles; on the making side, it was espoused to foster democratization. However, the studies reviewed indicated that companies do not appear to develop much beyond business-as-usual. From the research perspective, the conceptual potential of open design to promote sustainability saw little practical exploration. Additionally, issues around open design community governance and ownership, safety and reliability of open outcomes require further investigation.

TI Producing Printability: Articulation Work and Alignment in 3D Printing
SO HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION
LA English
DT Article
AB Three-dimensional printing is widely celebrated as enabling open design and manufacturing practice. With easy-to-use techniques such as automated modeling, fabrication machines ostensibly help designers turn ideas into fully fledged objects. Prior HCI literature focuses on improving printing through optimization and by developing printer and material capabilities. This paper expands such considerations by asking, how do 3D printing practitioners understand and create "printability?" And how might HCI better support the work that holds together printing workflows and changing ecosystems of materials and techniques? We conducted studies in two sites of open design: a technology firm in Silicon Valley, California and a makerspace in Stockholm, Sweden. Deploying workshops and interviews, we examine how practitioners negotiate the print experience, revealing a contingent process held together by trial and error exploration and careful interventions. These insights point to the value of tools and processes to support articulation work, what Strauss and colleagues have called the acts of fitting together people, tasks, and their ordering to accomplish an overarching project. We show that despite the sought-after efficiencies of such manufacturing, 3D printing entails articulation work, particularly acts of alignment, exposing messy modes of production carried out by a varied cast of practitioners, machines, and materials.

TI Makerspaces on Social Media: Shaping Access to Open Design
SO HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION
LA English
DT Article
ID FACEBOOK
AB Open Design is an emerging area of research that seeks to connect and extend the culture of making, social innovation, open-source software, and open-source hardware. A cornerstone for Open Design is to broaden participation in technology innovation by allowing people to use and contribute to publicly shared resources. Makerspaces are important access points to share and contribute to these resources. However, prior to entering the physical door of a makerspace, makerspaces' social media presence serve as the 'front door' for Open Design activities. In this paper, we examine different 'front doors' of Open Design, asking: What are the characteristics that produce makerspaces' social media presences, and how do these representations shape potential access to Open Design activities? We manually collected and qualitatively analyzed 500 public posts on the Facebook sites of five makerspaces in Copenhagen, Denmark. By choosing the same geographical area, we were able to explore the characteristics of makerspaces' social media presences for the same potential population of Open Design participants. Our analysis identifies three main characteristics of makerspaces' social media presence, which together shape access to Open Design activities, namely reach, transparency, and discourse. The display of these characteristics produce openness and availability in unique ways, and is constitutive for how Open Design activities are produced online. In this paper, we do not argue for or against specific social media representations. Instead, we argue that the specificities and differences between makerspaces' social media presences in the same geographical region have the strength of producing different identities across spaces, allowing for a broader definition and potential participation in Open Design.

TI Open Source, Open Vision: The MakerPro Network and the Broadening of
   Participation in Setting Taiwan's IT Vision Agenda
SO HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION
LA English
DT Article
AB HCI recognizes the importance of visions as both a design and futuring approach and a problem-solving technique. One challenge of visioning work is who can propose and shape IT visions and how they can achieve the widespread buy-in needed to make them efficacious. In this paper, we focus on the potential of making, open design, and open manufacturing for contributing toward, if not fully achieving, the broadening of participation in IT envisioning. We use Taiwan's MakerPro, a manufacturers and IT R&D community as a case to unpack what collective IT visioning looks like, how it shapes IT agendas concretely, and the implications for open design/open manufacturing research agenda in HCI. Our findings reveal how MakerPro members constructed and developed visions for open design and open manufacturing in Taiwan, obstacles to such visions, and how these obstacles can be collaboratively overcome through a participative and even democratic process. We also show that the collective purposiveness not only defines a regional vision agenda but also embraces an entire nation's future.

AB OBJECTIVES: to present the Italian network of longitudinal metropolitan studies (IN-LiMeS) and its application in the analysis of differences in health between Italians and immigrants.
   DESIGN: multicentre study of metropolitan populations based on closed and/or open cohorts.
   SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: integrated system of demographic, socioeconomic and health outcomes data for the enrollment and the retrospective follow-up of residents of nine Italian cities: Turin, Venice, Reggio Emilia, Modena, Bologna, Florence, Livorno, Prato, and Rome. The sources are the municipal population registries, the 2001 population Census, mortality registries, and hospital discharge archives. All cities have built the 2001 Census closed cohorts, which cover a total of 4,466,655 subjects. The open cohorts have been implemented in Turin, Venice, Reggio Emilia, Modena, Bologna, and Rome and include all residents for at least one day from 2001 to the latest available follow-up (currently 31.12.2013). More detailed socioeconomic data are available for those enrolled in Census cohorts; information on demographic characteristics, education, and citizenship is available from the population registers for the entire study population.
   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: demographic indicators and their time evolution.
   RESULTS: between 2001 and 2013, the population of the nine cities increased from 4,591,580 to 4,724,042 residents; immigrant women, who initially were a minority, equaled the male population by the end of the follow-up period, mirroring the gender distribution of the Italian citizens. The prevalence of immigrants tripled, reaching 13% of the total population share in 2013; the main areas of origin differed by city and over time. Immigrants were systematically younger than Italians.
   CONCLUSION: the IN-LiMeS is an integrated system built with the aim of monitoring the impact of socioeconomic circumstances on people's health, including immigrants' health. Future developments include: the implementation of an open design in all the participating cohorts in order to keep up with the changing population dynamics and to increase the statistical power of the study; the inclusion of new metropolitan cohorts in order to expand the geographical coverage; the acquisition of additional information sources in order to enhance the informative capability.

AB Measuring ingestive behavior of liquids in rodents is commonly used in studies of reward, metabolism, and circadian biology. Common approaches for measuring liquid intake in real time include computer-tethered lickometers or video-based systems. Additionally, liquids can be measured or weighed to determine the amount consumed without real-time sensing. Here, we built a photobeam-based sipper device that has the following advantages over traditional methods: (1) it is battery powered and fits in vivarium caging to allow home-measurements; (2) it quantifies the intake of two different liquids simultaneously for preference studies; (3) it is low cost and easily constructed, enabling high-throughput experiments; and (4) it is open source so that others can modify it to fit their experimental needs. We validated the performance of this device in three experiments. First, we calibrated our device using time-lapse video-based measurements of liquid intake and correlated sipper interactions with liquid intake. Second, we used the sipper device to measure preference for water versus chocolate milk, demonstrating its utility for two-bottle choice tasks. Third, we integrated the device with fiber photometry, establishing its utility for measuring neural activity in studies of ingestive behavior. This device requires no special equipment or caging, and is small, battery powered, and wireless, allowing it to be placed directly in rodent home cages. The total cost of fabrication is less than $100, and all design files and code are open source. Together, these factors greatly increase scalability and utility for a variety of behavioral neuroscience applications.

ID SPECIFICITY; SENSITIVITY; STATISTICS
AB The observational study design for estimating accuracy of diagnostic tests for suicide risk in clinical work is not ideal, due to the effects of directed suicide prevention to the high-risk group. This is an example of the confounding by indication and protopathic bias, which lead to misinterpretation of the accuracy terms sensitivity and specificity. The simple arithmetic mechanism presented here, forces the conclusion that the accuracy estimates sensitivity and specificity, applied in open prospective trials of surmised diagnostic tests for suicide risk, cannot be normally interpreted as accuracy estimators. Further, the related concept "prediction of suicide" is shown to be fundamentally illogical and should not be used in the present context. All these statements reveal a far-reaching problem within the suicide prevention research: Conclusions regarding the usefulness of diagnostic tests of suicide risk in the vast previous research since decades deserve reinterpretation. Diagnostic tests per se, can possess highly qualitative properties in estimating important suicidological aspects regarding a patient, but, when studied in an open design study, it cannot be demonstrated. This problem concerns rating scales and any biological and psychological tests in medicine, when confounding factors, for example, suicide prevention, influence the outcome because of the test result per se.

AB The housing crisis has received growing interest from academia, industry, and policymakers. Open construction systems have emerged as a promising solution to achieve long-term social, economic, and environmental sustainability. In this paper, extensive fieldwork was conducted to investigate a case of an open construction system, namely, the WikiHouse Den Bosch. The research framework builds on a combined view of two main concepts: conviviality and openness. The aim is to provide an in-depth understanding of the relationship between these two aspects and the literature regarding Design Global Manufacture Local. The analysis showed that conviviality and openness are complex and context-specific factors. The paper concludes by outlining the need for an institutionalized conviviality to open up new pathways for future practice to address sustainability issues.

AB Data collection by conservation biologists is undergoing radical change, with researchers collaborating across disciplines to create bespoke, low-cost monitoring equipment from open-source hardware (OSH). Compared to commercial hardware, OSH dramatically reduces participation costs. Four barriers currently hold back its wide adoption: (1) user inexperience inhibits initial uptake; (2) complex and costly manufacturing/distribution procedures impede global dissemination; (3) lack of creator support results in lapsed projects; and (4) lack of user support degrades continued utility in the field. Here, we propose a framework to address these barriers, illustrating how OSH offers a route to rapid expansion of community-driven conservation action.

AB The analysis of seismic noise provides a reliable estimation of the soil properties, which supposes the starting point for the assessment of the seismic hazard. The horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio technique calculates the resonant frequency of the soil just by using a single three-component sensor. Array measurements require at least several vertical sensors registering simultaneously and their analysis provides an estimation of the surface waves dispersion curve. Although these methods are relatively cheaper than other geotechnical techniques, the cost of the sensors and the multi-channel data acquisition system means that small research groups cannot afford this kind of equipment. In this work, two prototypes for registering seismic noise have been developed and implemented: a three-channel acquisition system, optimized for working with three-component sensors; and a twelve-channel acquisition system, prepared for working simultaneously with twelve vertical geophones. Both prototypes are characterized by being open-hardware, open-software, easy to implement, and low-cost. The main aim is to provide a data acquisition system that can be reproduced and applied by any research group. Both developed prototypes have been tested and compared with other commercial equipment, showing their suitability to register seismic noise and to estimate the soil characteristics.

AB In view of the future lack of human resources due to the aging of the population, the automatic, Intelligent Mechatronic Systems (IMSs) and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) have broad application prospects. However, complex application scenarios and limited open design resources make designing highly efficient ITS systems still a challenging task. In this paper, the optimal load factor solving solution is established. By converting the three user requirements including working distance, time and load into load-related factors, the optimal result can be obtained among system complexity, efficiency and system energy consumption. A specialized visual navigation and motion control system has been proposed to simplify the path planning, navigation and motion control processes and to be accurately calculated in advance, thereby further improving the efficiency of the ITS system. The validity of the efficiency calculation formula and navigation control method proposed in this paper is verified. Under optimal conditions, the actual working mileage is expected to be 99.7%, and the energy consumption is 83.5% of the expected value, which provides sufficient redundancy for the system. In addition, the individual ITS reaches the rated operating efficiency of 95.86%; in other words, one ITS has twice the ability of a single worker. This proves the accuracy and efficiency of the designed ITS system.

AB The use of animal-borne devices in wildlife studies is increasing due to the miniaturization of sensors and reductions in component costs. Retrieval of animal-borne devices is often advantageous for several reasons, including data retrieval and animal welfare considerations; however, commercially available drop-off units are often prohibitively expensive and/or unreliable. Here, we present 'OpenDropOff', an open-source, low-cost electronic drop-off unit for remotely detaching animal-borne sensors from individuals. OpenDropOff devices function by using heat, produced by running an electrical current through resistance wire (nichrome), to melt nylon (e.g. fishing) line, detaching sensors from animals at or after a pre-determined time. OpenDropOff can be constructed using commercially available components (costing < USD $15 in total; approximately 10% or less of many commercially available drop-off units) and can be customized to fit project- and species-specific needs. Fourteen OpenDropOff devices have been field deployed on koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) (n = 11), swamp wallaby (Wallabia bicolor) (n = 1), Australian brush turkey (Alectura lathami) (n = 1) and Australian white ibis (Threskiornis molucca) (n = 1), with the only detachment failure occurring after a device was damaged during the koala's unrelated death. OpenDropOff devices provide a wider range of researchers with a reliable, cost-effective tool for detaching animal-borne sensors. Their use could allow researchers to more efficiently allocate project resources, and their flexibility provides an opportunity to mitigate animal welfare concerns surrounding the use of animal-borne devices.

AB We report an easily assembled, high performance liquid/liquid separator constructed from a drilled-out block of aluminium, a short length of porous polytetrafluoroethylene tubing, and a small number of off-the-shelf components and 3D-printed parts. The separator relies on the two incoming liquids having different wettabilities to the wall of the porous capillary, with the more strongly wetting liquid leeching through the porous wall while the other liquid passes unhindered through the interior channel. To achieve complete separation of the two phases, the fluid streams at the separator outlets are monitored optically, and the back-pressure at one outlet is iteratively adjusted using a motorised needle valve until smooth time-invariant signals are recorded at both outlets. The separator may be applied to many pairings of immiscible liquids over a broad range of flow rates, automatically establishing complete separation within minutes of activation and adjusting dynamically to subsequent changes in the flow conditions. The separator - whose performance is competitive with far costlier commercial systems - is released here as open hardware, with technical diagrams, a full parts list, assembly instructions, and source code for its firmware.

AB Identifying the importance weights of engineering characteristics (ECs) is essential for allocating resources in product design. Quality function deployment (QFD) is widely used for rating ECs to satisfy consumer requirements (CRs). In existing approaches, ECs were rated by designers from CRs. With the development of the Internet, open design (OD) is exerting an increasing important effect, and consumers can freely express their requirements for the product. However, in OD environment there will be a large number of CRs expressed using the free text without the guide of purposive questions and the CRs are characterized by uncertainty and diversity of meaning, which makes it hard to rate ECs using the previous methods. To overcome the problem, this paper proposes an extended probabilistic language method based on fuzzy QFD to determine the importance weights of ECs according to the context of CRs in OD. The method focuses on considering the impact of the words in CRs to identify the relationships between CRs and ECs in OD. Meanwhile, a calculated model and a utility-based evaluation approach are suggested to rate ECs based on the fuzzy QFD. An example of the smartphone is given to illustrate the applicability of the proposed method.

AB In all studies involving wind speed, such as meteorology, wind turbines and agriculture accurate speed information for decision making is required. There are several types of anemometers, with medium and high costs, such as cup, hot wire and pitot tubes, the hot wire being more sensitive and expensive than others. The device developed in this work is the cup anemometer, that is easy to build. The great advantage of this device is the low cost, with an approximate value of US$ 50.00, using simple materials that are easy to find in commercial stores. The Reed Switch sensor is also another advantage as it does not require a sophisticated programming, as well as the open platform Arduino. The use of theoretical aerodynamic drag coefficients and the presented calculations resulted in values very close to a commercial anemometer. The coefficient of determination between the cup Anemometer and the standard sensor of Meteorological Research Institute IPMet/Brazil is R-2=0.9999, indicating strong correlation between the instruments. As the reference anemometer (IPMet) has high embedded technology and the prototype is low cost, we conclude that the project has an attractive cost benefit for possible development and production, reaching the objective of this work.

AB Azimuthal beam scanning eliminates the uneven excitation field arising from laser interference in through-objective total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. The same principle can be applied to scanning angle interference microscopy (SAIM), where precision control of the scanned laser beam presents unique technical challenges for the builders of custom azimuthal scanning microscopes. Accurate synchronization between the instrument computer, beam scanning system and excitation source is required to collect high quality data and minimize sample damage in SAIM acquisitions. Drawing inspiration from open-source prototyping systems, like the Arduino microcontroller boards, we developed a new instrument control platform to be affordable, easily programmed, and broadly useful, but with integrated, precision analog circuitry and optimized firmware routines tailored to advanced microscopy. We show how the integration of waveform generation, multiplexed analog outputs, and native hardware triggers into a single central hub provides a versatile platform for performing fast circle-scanning acquisitions, including azimuthal scanning SAIM and multiangle TIRF. We also demonstrate how the low communication latency of our hardware platform can reduce image intensity and reconstruction artifacts arising from synchronization errors produced by software control. Our complete platform, including hardware design, firmware, API, and software, is available online for community-based development and collaboration.

AB At the lowest layer of today's communication networks is an optical line system (OLS), a physical network of equipment, which carries high-frequency analog light signals over thousands of kilometers. Traditionally, an OLS was delivered as a turn-key solution by a single vendor. Within an OLS, reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexers (ROADMs) are active devices responsible for routing spectral chunks between input and output ports. ROADMs are arguably the most complex physical component of an OLS. In this paper, we describe an open design of a Czech Light ROADM, including the optical hardware, electronics, software, and the northbound communication interface. The performance of the ROADMs is evaluated in two test scenarios.

AB In this paper, an alternative to the traditional methodology related to signal processing-like subjects is proposed. These are subjects that require a deep mathematical and theoretical basis, but the practical goal is not often emphasized, which drives students to lose interest in the subject. Thus, a software-defined radio environment is proposed to provide a more practical view of the subject. This solution consists of an open hardware-software platform able to capture and process a wide range of frequencies. HackRF is the hardware component, while GNU Radio will provide the graphical support to this device. The tests performed with a set of 36 students have revealed that they are more satisfied with this framework than just employing a traditional equation-based environment as Matlab. Furthermore, their scores in the exams also support the suitability of the proposed platform.

ID RADIO TELEMETRY; TRACKING; BAT
AB The majority of bird and bat species are incapable of carrying tags that transmit their position to satellites. Given fundamental power requirements for such communication, burdened mass guidelines and battery technology, this constraint necessitates the continued use of very high frequency (VHF) radio beacons. As such, efforts should be made to mitigate their primary deficiencies: detection range, localization time and localization accuracy. The integration of a radiotelemetry system with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) could significantly improve the capacity for data collection from VHF tags. We present a UAV-integrated radiotelemetry system that relies on open source hardware and software. Localization methods, including signal processing, bearing estimation based on principal component analysis, localization techniques and test results, are discussed. Using a low-power beacon applicable for bats and small birds, testing showed that the improved vantage of the UAV-radiotelemetry system (UAV-RT) provided significantly higher received signal power compared to the low-level flights (maximum range beyond 1.4 km). Flight testing of localization methods showed median bearing errors between 2.3 degrees and 6.8 degrees, with localization errors of between 5% and 14% of the distance to the tag. In a direct comparison to an experienced radiotelemetry user, the UAV-RT system provided bearing and localization estimates with 53% less error. This paper introduces the core functionality and use methods of the UAV-RT system, while presenting baseline localization performance metrics. An associated website hosts plans for assembly and software installation. The methods of UAV-RT use for tag detection will be further developed in future works. For both the detection and localization problems, the mobility of a flying asset drastically reduces tracker time requirements. A 7-min flight would be sufficient to collect five equally spaced bearing estimates over a 1-km transect. The use of a software-defined radio on the UAV-RT system will allow for the simultaneous detection and localization of multiple tags.

ID DIGITAL HOLOGRAPHY; MICROSCOPE; LIGHT; RECONSTRUCTION; COMPACT
AB Digital holographic microscopy is an emerging, potentially low-cost alternative to conventional light microscopy for micro-object imaging on earth, underwater and in space. Immediate access to micron-scale objects however requires a well-balanced system design and sophisticated reconstruction algorithms, that are commercially available, however not accessible cost-efficiently. Here, we present an open-source implementation of a lens-less digital inline holographic microscope platform, based on off-the-shelf optical, electronic and mechanical components, costing less than $190. It employs a Blu-Ray semiconductor-laser-pickup or a light-emitting-diode, a pinhole, a 3D-printed housing consisting of 3 parts and a single-board portable computer and camera with an open-source implementation of the Fresnel-Kirchhoff routine. We demonstrate 1.55 mu m spatial resolution by laser-pickup and 3.91 mu m by the light-emitting-diode source. The housing and mechanical components are 3D printed. Both printer and reconstruction software source codes are open. The light-weight microscope allows to image label-free micro-spheres of 6.5 mu m diameter, human red-blood-cells of about 8 mu m diameter as well as fast-growing plant Nicotiana-tabacum-BY-2 suspension cells with 50 mu m sizes. The imaging capability is validated by imaging-contrast quantification involving a standardized test target. The presented 3D-printable portable open-source platform represents a fully-open design, low-cost modular and versatile imaging-solution for use in high-and low-resource areas of the world.

AB A large number of mobile mental health apps are available to the public but current knowledge about requirements of designing such solutions is scarce, especially from sociotechnical and user centred points of view. Due to the significant role of mobile apps in the mental health service models, identifying the design requirements of mobile mental health solutions is crucial. Some of those requirements have been addressed individually in the literature, but there are few research studies that show a comprehensive picture of this domain. This exploratory review aims to facilitate such holistic understanding. The main search keywords of the review were identified in a cross-disciplinary requirements workshop. The search was started by finding some core references in the healthcare databases. A wider range of references then has been explored using a snowball method. Findings showed that there is a good understanding of individual design requirements in current literature but there are few examples of implementing a combination of different design requirements in real world products. The design processes specifically developed for mobile mental health apps are also rare. Most studies on operational mobile mental health apps address major mental health issues while prevention and wellbeing areas are underdeveloped. In conclusion, the main recommendations for designing future mobile mental health solutions include: moving towards sociotechnical and open design strategies, understanding and creating shared value, recognizing all dimensions of efficacy, bridging design and medical research and development, and considering an ecosystem perspective.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are a rapidly evolving tool in geosciences and are increasingly deployed for studying the dynamic processes of the earth's surface. To assess the potential of autonomous low-cost UAVs for the mapping and monitoring of alpine glaciers, we conducted multiple aerial surveys on the Kanderfirn in the Swiss Alps in 2017 and 2018 using open hardware and software of the Paparazzi UAV project. The open-source photogrammetry software OpenDroneMap was tested for the generation of high-resolution orthophotos and digital surface models (DSMs) from aerial imagery and cross-checked with the well-established proprietary software Pix4D. Accurately measured ground control points served for the determination of the geometric accuracy of the orthophotos and DSMs. A horizontal (xy) accuracy of 0.7-1.2 m and a vertical (z) accuracy of 0.7-2.1 m was achieved for OpenDroneMap, compared to a xy-accuracy of 0.3-0.5 m and a z-accuracy of 0.4-0.5 m obtained for Pix4D. Based on the analysis and comparison of different orthophotos and DSMs, surface elevation, roughness and brightness changes from 3 June to 29 September 2018 were quantified. While the brightness of the glacier surface decreased linearly over the ablation season, the surface roughness increased. The mean DSM-based elevation change across the glacier tongue was 8 m, overestimating the measured melting and surface lowering at the installed ablation stakes by about 1.5 m. The presented results highlight that self-built fixed-wing UAVs in tandem with open-source photogrammetry software are an affordable alternative to commercial remote-sensing platforms and proprietary software. The applied low-cost approach also provides great potential for other regions and geoscientific disciplines.

AB Open-source technology for supporting the Industry 4.0 has become the target of academic research in many sectors. This study reviewed the trends of open-source technology, its forms, and some industrial applications. As a case study using open-source hardware and software for the mining industry, this study proposed a low-cost environmental monitoring system for non-metallic underground mines to support mine safety and occupational health issues. The system was developed using open-source hardware, Arduino and 3D printer, to design the monitoring device. An open-source software, MIT App Inventor, was used for developing an Android application for smartphones to enable remote communication with the system. Field experiments were conducted at an underground tunnel and a non-metallic underground mining site to assess the performance of the system in both mobile and static modes, respectively. Although a few limitations related to the precision of the low-cost dust and gas sensors still exist, the findings of the experiments show that the mining industry can benefit from open-source technology deployment when considering cost factors.

AB In the era of technological advances and innovations in transportation technologies, application of driving simulators for the investigation and assessment of the driving process provides a safe and suitable testing environment. Although driving simulators are crucial for further improvements in transportation, it is important to resolve one of their main disadvantages-simulator sickness. Therefore, suitable methods for the assessment of simulator sickness are required. The main aim of this paper was to present a non-invasive method for assessing simulator sickness by recording gastric myoelectrical activity-electrogastrography. Open-source hardware for electrogastrography together with recordings obtained in 13 healthy volunteers is presented, and the main aspects of signal processing for artifact cancellation and feature extraction were discussed. Based on the obtained results, it was concluded that slow-wave electrical gastric activity can be recorded during driving simulation by following adequate recommendations and that proposed features could be beneficial in describing non-ordinary electrogastrography signals.

AB Objectives: The Internet of Things (IoT) and its applications are growing simultaneously. These applications need new intelligent devices along heterogeneous networking. Which makes them costly to implement indeed. Platforms and open devices designed for open-source hardware are possible solutions. This research was conducted under an IoT design, implementation, and assessment model for the remote monitoring of pulse oximetry via oxygen partial saturation (SpO(2)) and heart rate (HR) with low-energy consumption. Methods: This study focused on the development of SpO(2) and HR measurements that will allow the monitoring and estimation in real time of the user's state and health related to the established parameters. Measurements were acquired and recorded using a remote web server that recorded the acquired variables for further processing. The statistical analysis data allows comparison of the registered data measured with theoretical models. Results: The IoT model was developed use Bluetooth low-energy devices, which comply with low-cost and open-hardware solutions operated via 'HTTP requests' for data transmission and reception from a cloud server to an edge device. Network performance assessment was conducted to guarantee the availability and integrity of the acquired values and signals. The system measured SpO(2) and HR variables. The most significant result was to achieve energy consumption 20% lower than that of devices in the market. Conclusions: In summary, the acquired data validation based on the IoT model had a transmission error of 0.001% which proves its applicability in healthcare.

   Prevention: A Retrospective Study
SO HEADACHE
LA English
DT Article
DE sodium divalproate; migraine; preventive treatment; weight gain
ID PROPHYLAXIS; TOPIRAMATE
AB Background and Objective Sodium divalproate is an effective neuromodulator for migraine prevention. Recommended doses vary from 1,000 to 1,500 mg/day, which may provoke unpleasant side effects as weight gain, tremor, and hair loss. Some patients do respond to lower doses even used once daily in ER presentations, but alternating low daily doses was never studied so far. The aim of this study was to evaluate the adherence, the tolerability, and the efficacy of sodium divalproate (SD) in low alternating daily doses for migraine prevention in patients of a tertiary center. Methods Consecutive migraineurs from a tertiary center to whom SD was prescribed as monotherapy from January 2017 until September 2018 were studied retrospectively. The doses were 250 mg alternated with 500 mg and were used based on the treating physician expertise and previous experience with tolerability issues when using higher doses. Headache frequency compared to baseline, adherence expressed by returning to a visit after 2 and 4 months and side effects reported by the patients, were evaluated. Results Sixty-eight patients (53 women and 15 men, aged 18-58) were included. The average headache frequency (HF) during baseline was decreased from 8.2 to 5.1 headache days/month among the 50 out of 68 patients returning at 2 months (adherence rate 73.5%). Weight gain was reported by 15 patients (30%, mean 2.1 kg). At 4 months, HF was reduced to 4.2 days/month (adherence rate 61.8%, n = 42) and weight gain reported by 18 patients (42.8%, mean 2.3 kg). Conclusions Despite the retrospective open design, which cannot allow definitive conclusions, SD in low alternating daily doses seems to be effective as with higher doses, but still induce modest weight gain. Controlled studies are necessary to confirm these observations.

TI High-throughput multicolor optogenetics in microwell plates
SO NATURE PROTOCOLS
LA English
DT Article
AB Optogenetic probes can be powerful tools for dissecting complexity in cell biology, but there is a lack of instrumentation to exploit their potential for automated, high-information-content experiments, This protocol describes the construction and use of the optoPlate-96, a platform for high-throughput three-color optogenetics experiments that allows simultaneous manipulation of common red- and blue-light-sensitive optogenetic probes, The optoPlate-96 enables illumination of individual wells in 96-well microwell plates or in groups of wells in 384-well plates. Its design ensures that there will be no cross-illumination between microwells in 96-well plates, and an active cooling system minimizes sample heating during light-intensive experiments. This protocol details the steps to assemble, test, and use the optoPlate-96. The device can be fully assembled without specialized equipment beyond a 3D printer and a laser cutter, starting from open-source design files and commercially available components. We then describe how to perform a typical optogenetics experiment using the optoPlate-96 to stimulate adherent mammalian cells. Although optoPlate-96 experiments are compatible with any plate-based readout, we describe analysis using quantitative single-cell immunofluorescence. This workflow thus allows complex optogenetics experiments (independent control of stimulation colors, intensity, dynamics, and time points) with high-dimensional outputs at single-cell resolution. Starting from 3D-printed and laser-cut components, assembly and testing of the optoPlate-96 can be accomplished in 3-4 h, at a cost of similar to$600. A full optoPlate-96 experiment with immunofluorescence analysis can be performed within similar to 24 h, but this estimate is variable depending on the cell type and experimental parameters.

TI A low-cost autonomous rover for polar science

LA English
DT Article
ID PHOTOGRAMMETRY; ROBOT
AB We present the developmental considerations, design, and deployment of an autonomous modular terrestrial rover for ice-sheet exploration that is inexpensive, easy to construct, and allows for instrumentation customization. The total construction cost for this rover is less than USD 3000, approximately one-tenth the cost of existing platforms, and it can be built using facilities frequently available at academic institutions (machine shop, 3-D printer, open-source hardware and software). Instrumentation deployed on this rover can be customized; the rover presented in this study was equipped with a dual-frequency GPS receiver and a digital SLR camera for constructing digital elevation models using structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry. We deployed this prototype rover on the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream to map local variations in snow accumulation and surface topography. The rover conducted four autonomous missions based out of the East Greenland Ice-Core Project (EastGRIP) camp during July 2017, measuring surface elevation transects across the hazardous ice-stream shear margins. During these missions, the rover proved capable of driving over 20 km on a single charge with a drawbar pull of 250 N, sufficient to tow instrumentation of up to 100 kg. The rover also acquired photographs that were subsequently used to construct digital elevation models of a site monitored for spatiotemporal variability in snow accumulation, demonstrating adequate stability for high-resolution imaging applications. Due to its low cost, low-power requirements, and simple modular design, mass deployments of this rover design are practicable. Operation of the rover in hazardous areas circumvents the substantial expense and risk to personnel associated with conventional, crewed deployments. Thus, this rover is an investigatory plat-form that enables direct exploration of polar environments considered too hazardous for conventional field expeditions.

AB Optical imaging of wholemount tissue samples provides greater understanding of structure-function relationships as the architecture of these specimens is generally well preserved. However, difficulties arise when attempting to stitch together images of multiple regions of larger, oddly shaped specimens. These difficulties include (1) maintaining consistent signal-to-noise ratios when the overlying sample surface is uneven, (2) ensuring sample viability when live samples are required, and (3) stabilizing the specimen in a fixed position in a flowing medium without distorting the tissue sample. To address these problems, we designed a simple and cost-efficient device that can be 3D-printed and machined. The design for the device, named the Platform for Planar Imaging of Curved Surfaces (PICS), consists of a sample holder, or cap with gaps for fluid flow and a depression for securing the sample in a fixed position without glue or pins, a basket with two arms that move along an external radius to rotate the sample around a central axis, and a customizable platform designed to fit on a commercially available temperature control system for slice electrophysiology. We tested the system using wholemounts of the murine subventricular zone (SVZ), which has a high degree of curvature, to assess sample viability and image quality through cell movement forover an hour for each sample. Using the PICS system, tissues remained viable throughout the imaging sessions, there were no noticeable decreases in the image SNR across an imaging plane, and there was no noticeable displacement of the specimen due to fluid flow.

AB An automated method based on open-source hardware was created for the separation of porphyrins fractions from crude oil, an essential step for the quantification of V and Ni as metalloporphyrins. Preparative liquid chromatography was implemented with a reverse phase gradient from MeOH to toluene. The system allows three solvents and fractions changes by using quaternary valves connected to an Arduino microcontroller, programmed on the basis of the absorbance signal measured and its first derivative. Additionally, the method was applied to crude oils (Venezuelan National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 8505 and from a marine reservoir). V and Ni were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and the V-porphyrin profile was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-ICP-MS. The concentrations of the metals grow in the last eluting toluene fractions, associated with asphaltenes. On the other hand, V-porphyrins in the first eluting MeOH fractions showed profiles of labile compounds, with a higher percentage in the Brazilian crude oil (4.9 mg L-1, corresponding to 18% of total V), in comparison to the one from the biodegraded NIST 8505 (59 mg L-1, corresponding to 7% of total V). The overall methodology has a good reproducibility and provides information on elements concentrations associated with porphyrin class compounds.

AB A near-infrared distyryl boron dipyrromethene-based sensor bearing one bis(1,2,3-triazole)amino receptor has been synthesized. This probe selectively and quickly binds to Hg2+ and Cu2+ ions in CH3CN/H2O (5:1 v/v) and exhibits remarkably blue-shifted absorption and fluorescence bands due to the inhibition of the intramolecular charge transfer process. The fluorescence changes of this probe upon binding to Hg2+ or Cu2+ ion are totally different, undergoing a ratiometric fluorescence enhancement (for Hg2+) or a fluorescence quenching (for Cu2+) mechanism. The corresponding vivid color changes can be easily seen by the naked eye. This probe was further introduced into Hela cells for living cell imaging and found to discriminate Hg2+ and Cu2+ ions through two near-infrared fluorescence emission channels. These overall results indicate that this Click-derived near-infrared BODIPY-based probe is potentially useful for ratiometric and discriminative detection of Hg2+ and Cu2+ ions in solutions and living cells.

AB In Earth science, we must often collect data from sensors installed in remote locations. Retrieving these data and storing them can be challenging. Present options include proprietary commercial dataloggers, communication devices, and protocols with rigid software and data structures that may require ongoing expenses. While there are open-source solutions that include telemetry, such as EnviroDIY's Mayfly, none presently generate real-time, remotely accessible workbooks (Aufdenkampe et al., 2017; EnviroDIY, 2018). The Openly Published Environmental Sensing (OPEnS) Lab developed the OPEnS Hub, a new approach to using low-power, open-source hardware and software to achieve real-time data logging from the field to the web. The Hub is an order of magnitude less expensive than commercial products, inherently modular and flexible, and aims to reduce technical barriers for users with little programming experience (DeBell, 2019). Data can be collected remotely using a host of transmission protocols to relay data from distributed in situ monitoring devices. The Hub mesh-networks with several nodes and backs up to an onboard microSD card. Telemetry options include 900 MHz Long Range Radio (LoRa) with up to 25 km range and Nordic Radio Frequency (nRF) for higher data rates (Feather, 2018). Ongoing transmissions from the Hub to the internet currently employ Ethernet with potential support for Wi-Fi and the cell network. The Hub engages a dynamic, low-latency portal to Google Sheets via the free Application Programming Interface (API), PushingBox, and an adaptable Google Apps Script. This framework was tested on 12 individual sensors nodes at remote sites in Oregon. This manuscript details our methods and evaluates PushingBox, Google Apps Script, Adafruit Industries' open-hardware Feather development boards, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and the aforementioned modes of data transfer.

ID SYSTEM
AB Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Manipulators (UAMs) have shown promising potential in mobile 3-dimensional grasping applications, but they still suffer from some difficulties impeding their board applications, such as target detection and indoor positioning. For the autonomous grasping mission, the UAMs need ability to recognize the objects and grasp them. Considering the efficiency and precision, we present a novel oriented-object detection method called Rotation-SqueezeDet. This method can run on embedded-platforms in near real-time. Besides, this method can give the oriented bounding box of an object in images to enable a rotation-aware grasping. Based on this method, a UAM platform was designed and built. We have given the formulation, positioning, control, and planning of the whole UAM system. All the mechanical designs are fully provided as open-source hardware for reuse by the community. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme was validated in multiple experimental trials, highlighting its applicability of autonomous aerial rotational grasping in Global Positioning System (GPS) denied environments. We believe this system can be deployed to many potential workplaces which need UAM to accomplish difficult manipulation tasks.

AB Background Cognitive deficits (CDs) in schizophrenia affect poor outcome and real-world community functioning. Because redox imbalance has been implicated, among other factors, in the pathophysiology of CDs, antioxidant compounds may have a beneficial effect in their treatment. Red yeast rice (RYR), besides its lipid-lowering effect, exhibit antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. Methods Thirty-five schizophrenia outpatients (age range, 18-60 years) on stable antipsychotic treatment and assessed by neuropsychological (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test [WCST], Verbal Fluency, and Stroop task) and psychodiagnostic instruments (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale) received RYR at daily dosage of 200 mg/d (total monacolin K/capsule content, 11.88 mg) for 12 weeks. Results Red yeast rice supplementation significantly improved WCST "perseverative errors" (P = 0.015), "total errors" (P = 0.017, P = 0.001), and phonemic fluency test (P = 0.008); a trend for improvement on other WCST variables ("nonperseverative errors," "perseverative responses," and "categories") was observed. Effect sizes, according to Cohen's suggestions, were small in all explored cognitive dimensions. There were no significant change in clinical symptoms and no subject-reported adverse effects. Conclusions Despite several limitations (open design, lack of a control group, short period of observation, small sample size, mode of controlling patients' compliance, the lack of assessment of patients' functional improvement), results suggest that RYR supplementation may be a potentially promising strategy for addressing CDs in schizophrenia; further randomized, placebo-controlled studies are needed to better evaluate the potential role of RYR for the treatment of CDs in schizophrenia.

AB European Robotics League (ERL) Emergency Robots is an outdoor robotics contest focusing on multidomain emergency response scenarios. In this context, the deployed robots are expected to fulfill land, underwater, and flying cooperative tasks which emulate real-world situations inspired by the 2011 Fukushima accident. Participation of the Tuscany Robotics Team at ERL Emergency Robots 2017 was deeply affected by damage to (and resulting unavailability of) the unmanned ground vehicle to be used in the competition. This damage occurred 3 days before the challenge. An entirely new working mobile platform was built from scratch using a low-cost chassis. It was able to compete with the other participants in the challenge and achieved various tasks (similar to 83% of the tasks completed by the best performer). The paper provides a complete description of the work carried out and the system used during the competition. The development was based on low-cost solutions, in particular: Adoption of open-hardware and open-software technology, providing cheap and fast-prototyping solutions. Use of smartphones, allowing sophisticated sensors to be exploited in an affordable way. Employment of Cloud infrastructures, to reduce the computational burden of offloading heavy processes. Results of this experience represent a concrete demonstration, showing that even low-cost solutions can achieve complex tasks, such as those required for the European robotic competition. The presented lessons learned aim to provide guidelines useful for reacting to unexpected events. Finally, the team was honored with the Creativity Award "for building a land robot from scratch in less than 2 days when their ground platform broke."

AB Droplet microfluidics generally employed syringe pumps to infuse fluids into microchannels that created unavoidable interface fluctuation during emulsification. They also caused droplet differentiation among different batches due to the reloading of syringes. We herein reported a new gravity-driven approach to supply a steady pressure input on the microchannels and continuous liquid supplement due to the semi-open design. This microfluidic system combined by several overflow units could effectively reduce the disturbance on the multiphase interface, and single emulsions with high monodispersity could be continuously generated. By changing the overflow height, different sizes of single emulsions could be obtained. In addition, double emulsions could also be realized by simply adding another unit without effecting further changes in the system. These features indicated that the gravity-driven overflow microfluidic system could infuse fluids steadily and continuously, and could widely contribute to fields requiring less manual power.

TI Flavor-cyber-agriculture: Optimization of plant metabolites in an
   open-source control environment through surrogate modeling
SO PLOS ONE

AB Food production in conventional agriculture faces numerous challenges such as reducing waste, meeting demand, maintaining flavor, and providing nutrition. Contained environments under artificial climate control, or cyber-agriculture, could in principle be used to meet many of these challenges. Through such environments, phenotypic expression of the plant-mass, edible yield, flavor, and nutrients-can be actuated through a "climate recipe," where light, water, nutrients, temperature, and other climate and ecological variables are optimized to achieve a desired result. This paper describes a method for doing this optimization for the desired result of flavor by combining cyber-agriculture, metabolomic phenotype (chemotype) measurements, and machine learning. In a pilot experiment, (1) environmental conditions, i.e. photoperiod and ultraviolet (UV) light (known to affect production of flavor-active molecules in edible plants) were applied under different regimes to basil plants (Ocimum basilicum) growing inside a hydroponic farm with an open-source design; (2) flavoractive volatile molecules were measured in each plant using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS); and (3) symbolic regression was used to construct a surrogate model of this chemistry from the input environmental variables, and this model was used to discover new combinations of photoperiod and UV light to increase this chemistry. These new combinations, or climate recipes, were then implemented in the hydroponic farm, and several of them resulted in a marked increase in volatiles over control. The process also led to two important insights: it demonstrated a "dilution effect", i.e. a negative correlation between weight and desirable chemical species, and it discovered the surprising effect that a 24-hour photoperiod of photosynthetic-active radiation, the equivalent of all-day light, induces the most flavor molecule production in basil. In this manner, surrogate optimization through machine learning can be used to discover effective recipes for cyber-agriculture that would be difficult and time-consuming to find using hand-designed experiments.

AB Understanding what drives user loyalty is a central theme in the research fields of open design community (ODC) and sustained innovation. Drawing on theories of network externalities and expectation disconfirmation, this paper develops a theoretical model reflecting the effect of determinants on user loyalty. The model is tested utilizing survey data amassed from 389 users of a typical ODC, Xiaomi Corporation's forum, in China. The major findings of our work as follows: First, satisfaction plays the most important role in explaining the user loyalty to ODCs, and disconfirmation of fan care is the most critical factor influencing user satisfaction. Second, the perceived network size exerts negative impact on user loyalty to an ODC. Third, impacts of different factors on user loyalty vary due to gender difference. This research advanced the knowledge in Open Design by demonstrating the antecedents of participant's loyalty towards ODC, and highlighting the motivations of individual's open design participation behavior.

AB Ultra-wideband (UWB) localization is one of the most promising approaches for indoor localization due to its accurate positioning capabilities, immunity against multipath fading, and excellent resilience against narrowband interference. However, UWB researchers are currently limited by the small amount of feasible open source hardware that is publicly available. We developed a new open source hardware platform, Wi-PoS, for precise UWB localization based on Decawave's DW1000 UWB transceiver with several unique features: support of both long-range sub-GHz and 2.4 GHz back-end communication between nodes, flexible interfacing with external UWB antennas, and an easy implementation of the MAC layer with the Time-Annotated Instruction Set Computer (TAISC) framework. Both hardware and software are open source and all parameters of the UWB ranging can be adjusted, calibrated, and analyzed. This paper explains the main specifications of the hardware platform, illustrates design decisions, and evaluates the performance of the board in terms of range, accuracy, and energy consumption. The accuracy of the ranging system was below 10 cm in an indoor lab environment at distances up to 5 m, and accuracy smaller than 5 cm was obtained at 50 and 75 m in an outdoor environment. A theoretical model was derived for predicting the path loss and the influence of the most important ground reflection. At the same time, the average energy consumption of the hardware was very low with only 81 mA for a tag node and 63 mA for the active anchor nodes, permitting the system to run for several days on a mobile battery pack and allowing easy and fast deployment on sites without an accessible power supply or backbone network. The UWB hardware platform demonstrated flexibility, easy installation, and low power consumption.

AB Recent advances in smartphones and affordable open-source hardware platforms have enabled the development of low-cost architectures for Internet-of-Things (IoT)-enabled home automation and security systems. These systems usually consist of sensing and actuating layer that is made up of sensors such as passive infrared sensors, also known as motion sensors; temperature sensors; smoke sensors, and web cameras for security surveillance. These sensors, smart electrical appliances, and other IoT devices connect to the Internet through a home gateway. This paper lays out an architecture for a cost-effective smart door sensor that will inform a user through an Android application, of door open events in a house or office environment. The proposed architecture uses an Arduino-compatible Elegoo Mega 2560 microcontroller board along with the Raspberry Pi 2 board for communicating with a web server that implements a RESTful API. Several programming languages are used in the implementation and further applications of the door sensor are discussed as well as some of its shortcomings such as possible interference from other radio frequency devices.

AB By using a copper-promoted alkyne-azide cycloaddition reaction, two boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) derivatives bearing a bis(1,2,3-triazole)amino receptor at the meso position were prepared and characterized. For the analogue with two terminal triethylene glycol chains, the fluorescence emission at 509 nm responded selectively toward Hg2+ ions, which greatly increased the fluorescence quantum yield from 0.003 to 0.25 as a result of inhibition of the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process. By introducing two additional rhodamine moieties at the termini, the resulting conjugate could also detect Hg2+ ions in a highly selective manner. Upon excitation at the BODIPY core, the fluorescence emission of rhodamine at 580 nm was observed and the intensity increased substantially upon addition of Hg2+ ions due to inhibition of the PET process followed by highly efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the BODIPY core to the rhodamine moieties. The Hg2+-responsive fluorescence change of these two probes could be easily seen with the naked eye. The binding stoichiometry between the probes and Hg2+ ions in CH3CN was determined to be 1:2 by Job ' s plot analysis and H-1 NMR titration, and the binding constants were found to be (1.2 +/- 0.1)x10(11) m(-2) and (1.3 +/- 0.3)x10(10) m(-2), respectively. The overall results suggest that these two BODIPY derivatives can serve as highly selective fluorescent probes for Hg2+ ions. The rhodamine derivative makes use of a combined PET-FRET sensing mechanism which can greatly increase the sensitivity of detection.

AB This paper presents an open source framework called Creamino. It consists of an Arduino-based cost-effective quick-setup EEG platform built with off-the-shelf components and a set of software modules that easily allow users to connect this system to Simulink or BCI-oriented tools (such as BCI2000 or OpenViBE) and set up a wide number of neuroscientific experiments. Creamino is capable of processing multiple EEG channels in real-time and operates under Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X in real-time on a standard PC. Its objective is to provide a system that can be readily fabricated and used for neurophysiological experiments and, at the same time, can serve as the basis for development of novel BCI platforms by accessing and modifying its open source hardware and software libraries. Schematics, gerber files, bill of materials, source code, software modules, demonstration videos, and instructions on how to use these modules are available free of charge for research and educational purposes online at https://github.com/ArcesUnibo/creamino. Application cases show how the system can be used for neuroscientific or BCI experiments. Thanks to its low production cost and its compatibility with open-source BCI tools, the system presented is particularly suitable for use in BCI research and educational applications.

AB Soil columns have been utilized in hydrology to study vertical solute transfer through porous material for decades. Soil columns are typically designed as open tubes with soil held in place with meshing. While this open design is sufficient for non-hazardous particles, it is not ideal for hazardous biological contaminants that may be harmful to humans. The design of this study features a closed soil column system for use with potentially hazardous biological components. The apparatus is comprised of a mist nozzle, flow-reducing cap, and meshing to simulate rainfall on each soil column. After percolating through the soil, water and contaminants pass through a funnel coupling and discharge tube into a collection container. For additional safety, the soil column design fits within a standard biosafety cabinet for use with hazardous contaminants. Its modular design allows for simple maintenance, water flowrate adjustment, and versatility that encourages use in multiple applications. These soil columns were created to study the vertical flow of pathogens, pesticides, and other biological agents. Further experimentation with various hazardous components will develop a better understanding of their fate and transport in soil. This paper details the construction processes and testing methods to validate the system's ability to replicate a desired flowrate, which is a precursor to studying the vertical transport of pathogens and other agents through soil.

AB Operant conditioning is a crucial tool in neuroscience research for probing brain function. While molecular, anatomical and even physiological techniques have seen radical increases in throughput, efficiency, and reproducibility in recent years, behavioural tools have somewhat lagged behind. Here we present a fully automated, high-throughput system for self-initiated conditioning of up to 25 group-housed, radio-frequency identification (RFID) tagged mice over periods of several months and >10(6) trials. We validate this "AutonoMouse" system in a series of olfactory behavioural tasks and show that acquired data is comparable to previous semi-manual approaches. Furthermore, we use AutonoMouse to systematically probe the impact of graded olfactory bulb lesions on olfactory behaviour, demonstrating that while odour discrimination in general is robust to even most extensive disruptions, small olfactory bulb lesions already impair odour detection. Discrimination learning of similar mixtures as well as learning speed are in turn reliably impacted by medium lesion sizes. The modular nature and open-source design of AutonoMouse should allow for similar robust and systematic assessments across neuroscience research areas.

AB Fiber photometry is the process of recording bulk neural activity by measuring fluorescence changes in activity sensitive indicators such as GCaMP through an optical fiber. We present a system of open source hardware and software for fiber photometry data acquisition consisting of a compact, low cost, data acquisition board built around the Micropython microcontroller, and a cross platform graphical user interface (GUI) for controlling acquisition and visualising signals. The system can acquire two analog and two digital signals, and control two external LEDs via built in LED drivers. Time-division multiplexed illumination allows independent readout of fluorescence evoked by different excitation wavelengths from a single photoreceiver signal. Validation experiments indicate this approach offers better signal to noise for a given average excitation light intensity than sinusoidally-modulated illumination. pyPhotometry is substantially cheaper than commercial hardware filling the same role, and we anticipate, as an open source and comparatively simple tool, it will be easily adaptable and therefore of broad interest to a wide range of users.

AB This paper presents the design and hardware implementation of open-source hardware dedicated to smart converter systems development. Smart converters are simple or interleaved converters. They are equipped with controllers that are able to online impedance match for the maximum power transfer. These conversion systems are particularly feasible for photovoltaic and all renewable energies systems working in continuous changing operating conditions. Smart converters represent promising solutions in recent energetic scenarios, in fact their application is deepening and widening. In this context, the availability of a hardware platform could represent a useful tool. The platform was conceived and released as an open hardware instrument for academy and industry to benefit from the improvements brought by the researchers' community. The usage of a novel, open-source platform would allow many developers to design smart converters, focusing on algorithms instead of electronics, which could result in a better overall development ecosystem and rapid growth in the number of smart converter applications. The platform itself is proposed as a benchmark in the development and testing of different maximum power point tracking algorithms. The designed system is capable of accurate code implementations, allowing the testing of different current and voltage-controlled algorithms for different renewable energies systems. The circuit features a bi-directional radio frequency communication channel that enables real-time reading of measurements and parameters, and remote modification of both algorithm types and settings. The proposed system was developed and successfully tested in laboratory with a solar module simulator and with real photovoltaic generators. Experimental results indicate state-of-art performances as a converter, while enhanced smart features pave the way to system-level management, real-time diagnostics, and on-the-flight parameters change. Furthermore, the deployment feasibility allows different combinations and arrangements of several energy sources, converters (both single and multi-converters), and modulation strategies. To our knowledge, this project remains the only open-source hardware smart converter platform used for educational, research, and industrial purposes so far.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Although waste stabilization ponds (WSPs) are widely used in developing countries, monitoring data on their operational performance are scarce. Traditional methods for monitoring in-pond conditions, i.e. conducting hand held measurements from a small boat or installing fixed sensor networks, are not straightforward to realize and create an unhealthy working environment for field workers. A promising technology for the safe and efficient collection of monitoring data is a compact autonomous surface vehicle (ASV), capable of autonomous navigation along a predefined trajectory based on geographic coordinates and measurements in different places and depths. In this practical paper, the development process, technical details and functional testing results of a low-cost ASV for WSP monitoring are presented. Commonly available construction materials and electronic components were used to ensure affordability and reparability. The access to online tutorials and peer-support was crucial for assembling the open-source autopilot and data logger. The ASV demonstrated satisfactory performance for both the autonomous navigation as well as the georeferenced data logging of measurements at a real-scale WSP in Paraguay. This study demonstrates how the adoption of open-source hardware and software offers the flexibility for the wastewater professionals to develop customized DIY solutions for specific monitoring applications and working environments.

AB This paper characterizes and explores a corporate strategy in which downstream firms collaborate to develop open substitute designs for proprietary hardware they would otherwise purchase from upstream suppliers. This strategy centrally involves the downstream firms distributing design costs over multiple down-stream firms-a strategy that is routine to producers selling to multiple down-stream firms but which has been in the past typically not practical for coalitions of downstream firms. Today, downstream firms find it increasingly feasible to codesign products they may all purchase because of two technological trends. First, computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing and other design technologies are lowering downstream firms' costs to develop designs for purchased hardware inputs. Second, better communication technologies are lowering the costs of doing such projects collaboratively, even among large groups of downstream customer firms. Downstream firms collaborating to develop a design for a hardware input they can all purchase could in principle choose to protect their design as a club good. However, opening up collaboratively created designs to free riders can increase the profits of the contributing firms for several reasons we explore and model. Important among these is that free revealing draws free riders away from purchases of proprietary software or hardware to customer-developed free substitutes. This "scale-stealing" mechanism reduces the markets of up-stream suppliers of competing proprietary inputs. In the case of hardware only, free riders also contribute to reducing the average manufacturing costs of the open hardware by increasing purchase volumes and so creating increased economies of scale. Resulting reduced unit purchase costs benefit downstream firms contributing to the free design as well as free riders.

TI Technologies of friendship: Accessibility politics in the 'how to' mode
SO SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE accessibility; bodily diversity; friendship; re-description; relations
AB This text is an ethnographic account of a singular, Barcelona-based activist endeavour called En torno a la silla (ETS): a do-it-yourself and open design and making collective engaging in a very peculiar form of accessibility politics beyond a 'disability rights' framework. In it, I entangle intimately with ETS's relational interventions, in the form of making and documentation processes. What animates me is a political engagement with the practice of 're-description', paying attention to the singularity of what relational vocabularies and practices bring to the fore. In describing the context of its appearance, as well as several of the collective's endeavours, I address ETS's relational register. Rather than being a clear-cut activist group with the aim of materialising the 'inclusion' of 'disabled people' through 'technical aids', ETS engaged in producing what they called 'technologies of friendship': frail and careful material explorations opening up interstitial relational spaces of 'mutual access' between bodily diverse people. Through circulating tutorials, poetic accounts, digitally and in workshops and presentations, ETS's technologies of friendship became also ways of addressing how relations can be materialised and reflexively described, making available in its wake ways to re-enact them. Thus it produced an inspiring 'how to' accessibility politics: a material-political concern with the speculative opening up and materialisation of conditions for the very happening of relations, relating at the hinges of unrelatability.

AB This article presents an innovative and low-cost solution for optimizing the acquisition of performance data of small-laboratory-scale photovoltaic devices. A novel measuring setup is proposed, designed based on an Arduino microcontroller and low-cost components, coupled with open source hardware and software. The manuscript describes in detail the instrument design, components and assembly enabling the reproduction and customization of the instrument for any reader. The setup is combined with an optional web-platform, which enables fast analysis and comparison of the collected data.
   For the demonstration of the instrument in operation, comparison of measurements of solar cell with the developed setup and commercial products has been conducted. It is shown that the presented prototype provides values of accuracy and precision during I-V curve recording, comparable with the values measured using a commercial source-meter (Keithley 2400). The study also discusses the unique advantages of easy transport and data collection by the setup and the drawbacks in the hardware, which have been observed during a round robin study.

AB Nowadays, global engineers need to be equipped with professional skills and knowledge to solve 21st century problems. The educational program, created in digital learning rooms of the Higher Engineering Education Alliance Program (HEEAP) program supported by Arizona State University, became a pioneer in teaching learners to work within the community. First, the combination of a novel instructional strategy and an integrated education in which project-based approach is employed to apply the technical knowledge. During this, students in mechatronics, computer science, and mechanics must collaborate with peers from industrial systems engineering. Second, in this paper, the design of an open structure connecting multi-disciplinary major is illustrated with a new teaching approach. It is proved to be better by combining specialized understandings of various types in a wide range of applications. From this basis support, participants could implement additional components quickly while keeping the cost low, making the products feasible and user-friendly. Last but not least, students are facilitated with a free library that helps to control simply despite lacking experience in robotics or automation. Several examples show that students are capable of developing things by themselves on open design. In brief, this platform might be an excellent tool to teach and visualize the practical scenario in a multi-disciplinary field.

AB Conservation researchers require low-cost access to acoustic monitoring technology. However, affordable tools are often constrained to short-term studies due to high energy consumption and limited storage. To enable long-term monitoring, energy and space efficiency must be improved on such tools. This paper describes the development and deployment of three acoustic detection algorithms that reduce the power and storage requirements of acoustic monitoring on affordable, open-source hardware. The algorithms aim to detect bat echolocation, to search for evidence of an endangered cicada species, and also to collect evidence of poaching in a protected nature reserve. The algorithms are designed to run on AudioMoth: a low-cost, open-source acoustic monitoring device, developed by the authors and widely adopted by the conservation community. Each algorithm addresses a detection task of increasing complexity, implementing extra analytical steps to account for environmental conditions such as wind, analysing samples multiple times to prevent missed events, and incorporating a hidden Markov model for sample classification in both the time and frequency domain. For each algorithm, we report on real-world deployments carried out with partner organisations and also benchmark the hidden Markov model against a convolutional neural network, a deep-learning technique commonly used for acoustics. The deployments demonstrate how acoustic detection algorithms extend the use of low-cost, open-source hardware and facilitate a new avenue for conservation researchers to perform large-scale monitoring.

AB IoT is much more than a large number of objects or customer devices connected to the Internet. IoT offers organizations many more opportunities than they can imagine. According to this, sooner or later they will probably choose to build their own IoT network. In this article, we review the technologies of IoT LPWAN Sigfox and LoRa. It can be considered the most important at present due to its ability to make the smart city possible. We also propose the development, deployment and implementation of a mixed IoT architecture LoRa-Sigfox composed of components based on open hardware and software. The architecture is evaluated in a real environment focused on remote monitoring of water meter devices.

AB An important challenge for our society is the transformation of traditional power systems to a decentralized model based on renewable energy sources. In this new scenario, advanced devices are needed for real-time monitoring and control of the energy flow and power quality (PQ). Ideally, the data collected by Internet of Thing (IoT) sensors should be shared to central cloud systems for online and off-line analysis. In this paper openZmeter (oZm) is presented as an advanced low-cost and open-source hardware device for high-precision energy and power quality measurement in low-voltage power systems. An analog front end (AFE) stage is designed and developed for the acquisition, conditioning, and processing of power signals. This AFE can be stacked on available quadcore embedded ARM boards. The proposed hardware is capable of adapting voltage signals up to 800 V AC/DC and currents up to thousands of amperes using different probes. The oZm device is described as a fully autonomous open-source system for the computation and visualization of PQ events and consumed/generated energy, along with full details of its hardware implementation. It also has the ability to send data to central cloud management systems. Given the small size of the hardware design and considering that it allows measurements under a wide range of operating conditions, oZm can be used both as bulk metering or as metering/submetering device for individual appliances. The design is released as open hardware and therefore is presented to the community as a powerful tool for general usage.

AB Microphysiological systems hold the promise to increase the predictive and translational power of in vitro substance testing owing to their faithful recapitulation of human physiology. However, the implementation of academic developments in industrial settings remains challenging. We present an injection-molded microfluidic microtissue (MT) culture chip that features two channels with 10 MT compartments each and that was designed in compliance with microtiter plate standard formats. Polystyrene as a chip material enables reliable, large-scale production and precise control over experimental conditions due to low adsorption or absorption of small, hydrophobic molecules at or into the plastic material in comparison with predecessor chips made of polydimethylsiloxane. The chip is operated by tilting, which actuates gravity-driven flow between reservoirs at both ends of every channel, so that the system does not require external tubing or pumps. The flow rate can be modulated by adjusting the tilting angle on demand. The top-open design of the MT compartment enables efficient MT loading using standard or advanced pipetting equipment, ensures oxygen availability in the chip, and allows for high-resolution imaging. Every channel can be loaded with up to 10 identical or different MTs, as demonstrated by culturing liver and tumor MTs in the same medium channel on the chip.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) provides the ability to digitize physical objects into virtual data, thanks to the integration of hardware (e.g., sensors, actuators) and network communications for collecting and exchanging data. In this digitization process, however, security challenges need to be taken into account in order to prevent information availability, integrity, and confidentiality from being compromised. In this paper, security challenges of two broadly used technologies, RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) and Bluetooth, are analyzed. First, a review of the main vulnerabilities, security risk, and threats affecting both technologies are carried out. Then, open hardware and open source tools like: Proxmark3 and Ubertooth as well as BtleJuice and Bleah are used as part of the practical analysis. Lastly, risk mitigation and counter measures are proposed.

AB Combining fluorescence and transmitted light sources for microscopy is an invaluable method in cellular neuroscience to probe the molecular and cellular mechanisms of cells. This approach enables the targeted recording from fluorescent reporter protein expressing neurons or glial cells in brain slices and fluorescence-assisted electrophysiological recordings from subcellular structures. However, the existing tools to mix multiple light sources in one-photon microscopy are limited. Here, we present the development of several microcontroller devices that provide temporal and intensity control of light emitting diodes (LEDs) for computer controlled microscopy illumination. We interfaced one microcontroller with mu Manager for rapid and dynamic overlay of transmitted and fluorescent images. Moreover, on the basis of this illumination system we implemented an electronic circuit to combine two pulsed LED light sources for fast (up to 1 kHz) ratiometric calcium (Ca2+) imaging. This microcontroller enabled the calibration of intracellular Ca2+ concentration and furthermore the combination of Ca2+ imaging with optogenetic activation. The devices are based on affordable components and open-source hardware and software. Integration into existing bright-field microscope systems will take similar to 1 day. The microcontroller based LED imaging substantially advances conventional illumination methods by limiting light exposure and adding versatility and speed.

AB The study of two- dimensional (2D) materials is a rapidly growing area within nanomaterials research. However, the high equipment costs, which include the processing systems necessary for creating these materials, can be a barrier to entry for some researchers interested in studying these novel materials. Such process systems include those used for chemical vapor deposition, a preferred method for making these materials. To address this challenge, this article presents the first open-source design for an automated chemical vapor deposition system that can be built for less than a third of the cost for a comparable commercial system. The materials and directions for the system are divided by subsystems, which allows the system to be easily built, customized and upgraded, depending upon the needs of the user. We include the details for the specific hardware that will be needed, instructions for completing the build, and the software needed to automate the system. With a chemical vapor deposition system built as described, a variety of 2D nanomaterials and their heterostructures can be grown. Specifically, the experimental results clearly demonstrate the capability of this open-source design in producing high quality, 2D nanomaterials such as graphene and tungsten disulfide, which are at the forefront of research in emerging semi-conductor devices, sensors, and energy storage applications.

AB Background: Small-animal MRI is an important investigative tool for basic and preclinical research. High-resolution anatomical and functional studies of the brain require artifact-free images that are acquired with a highly sensitive radiofrequency (RF) coil.
   New Method: The animal holder plays an important role in mitigating image artifacts: motion artifacts are reduced by immobilizing the animal and geometric-distortion artifacts are reduced by accurately positioning the animal to improve static-field shimming. The RF coil, in turn, must provide high sensitivity over the whole brain and not physically interfere with the animal holder. To accomplish these tasks, the animal holder and RF coil should be designed in tandem. In this manuscript, animal holders and RF coils for mice, rats, and marmoset monkeys are described. Each animal holder includes components for anesthesia delivery and animal immobilization, as well as a compatible receive coil.
   Results/Comparison with Existing Method(s): Animal holders were capable of accurate and reproducible positioning (for the marmoset, this was in the stereotactic plane), consequently reducing geometric distortion in echo-planar images. Ear bars were designed in conjunction with receive-coil formers, thereby maximizing the sensitive region of coils, while concurrently reducing motion to less than a pixel over EPI time series. Motion and SNR were quantified to facilitate direct comparison to existing animal holders and RF coils. All computer-aided-design (CAD) files of animal holders and RF coils are provided to promote dissemination.
   Conclusions: The confluence of design between the animal holder and RF coil provides a pragmatic solution for routine imaging of small animals.

AB The purpose of this document is to evaluate the implementation of technology to the hydroponics technique. Knowing that classical cultivation requires the permanent care of the human being for the irrigation of water and tender of the nutritive solution, it is proposed to use technology to replace the basic functions of crop irrigation through the use of programmable and reprogrammable microcontrollers, thus following the free hardware culture, this paper evaluates a scalable system with sensors, an open source hardware and software platform to interact between analog and digital signals. Within the steps that comprehend the realization of the project, the methodology based on components, provides the appropriate guidance for the analysis and choice of hardware, thus allowing the integration of the electronic components to work along with the appropriate coding; as a result the project will collect the pH value present in the nutrient solution, if the value is not adequate, it will automatically activate the insertion of the solution to the container reservoir, to subsequently operate the automated water irrigation for hydroponic farming. Another relevant aspect is that the project can be improved with other devices that will allow an even greater control of variables and data of hydroponics crops.

AB The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the advantages of computer network have attracted the attention of technological experts. However, network security issues remain a challenge. Controlling Web traffic and preventing attack to Web server, especially DoS/DDoS, are tremendous in the current computing ecosystem. In this paper, we propose a solution for controlling connections of the inside as well as the outside of network systems by using an integrated hardware, which would be deployed at gateway of the networks. It is not only used to implement rules but also monitor the network traffic, especially for web traffic which is considered as the common type in the Internet. In our solution, we prefer to use the IP SLA to control the web traffic, rather proxy to set up rules as well as a data stream algorithm for fast detecting Hot-IPs to prevent attacks from outside networks to the inside servers. The proposed solution is trouble-free to use and enhance security in small & medium networks as well.

AB Millions of small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS), or drones weighing less than 55 pounds, will fly in urban airspaces within a decade. This is in addition to goals for increased Urban Air Mobility (UAM): larger transportation UAS and piloted air vehicles, including air taxi service and innovative aviation designs to revolutionize transportation. A significant problem is the lack of current management systems for this extremely large volume of air traffic, composed of heterogeneous drone shapes, sizes, and onboard equipment capabilities, flying adjacent to larger UAM vehicles in spaces previously unoccupied by General Aviation (GA). Robust and resilient detection, identification, localization, and tracking of sUAS sharing UAM airspace is complicated by urban factors such as non-transmitting, non-cooperative drones. Exacerbating these challenges, current technological limitations and vulnerabilities in Global Positioning System (GPS), Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), and Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) can pose safety and security threats. To streamline a vision of safe and secure sUAS-UAM shared airspace, we propose Drone Net, a UAS Traffic Management (UTM) network of multi-modal ground and flight instruments.
   Drone Net is an architecture fusing a network of passive visual and acoustic sensor nodes with active Radio Detection and Ranging (radar) and Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) sensing methods for UTM, designed for integration with existing Air Traffic Control (ATC) and future UAM systems. The purpose of the Drone Net system is to evaluate use of Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) and acoustic arrays networked within an urban UAS operating region such as uncontrolled Class-G and waivergranted Class-D airspace. The Drone Net approach combines detection, tracking, and localization estimation from radar, ADSB, and EO/IR such that the design is robust to sensor errors, sample loss, and spoofing or other types of attacks. The system experimental design allows for emulation of corrupted ADS-B, GPS, and INS data on our flight platform including capability to communicate with ground radar and EO/IR to recover from flight instrument major and minor malfunctions such that a Drone Net cooperative UAS can be engineered to be fail-safe and fail-secure. We hypothesize that the Drone Net network of rooftop sensors, shown below, provides this conceptualized fail-safe, fail-secure property based upon the combination of self-localization with backup and confirming data from the ground sensor network.
   Further, with ground-system sensor fusion as well as UTM flight plan and registration information fusion, the overall system can manage small UAS that are both compliant and noncompliant alongside GA and UAM more safely than a single mode like ADS-B alone. To test our hypothesis, we envision two experiments this year. First, a test to confirm that we can emulate ADS-B, GPS, and INS sensor data corruption, leading to recovery using backup flight (lidar, EO/IR) or ground (radar, EO/IR) data to safely land an ALTA6 or other test UAS. Second, a series of Sense-and-Avoid (SAA) experiments between our test UAS and a tethered aerial obstacle. In the future, we will use this experience with fail-safe, fail-secure methods and software to further test more advanced scenarios between multiple UAS.
   The network of Drone Net instruments in a local area as well as regional and more global cloud-based networks will allow for heterogeneous information fusion and algorithm development for multi-sensor drone detection, classification, and identification with more accuracy than a single database or sensor system. The latent power of the Drone Net project is in its open-design ground and flight sensor network with data sharing capability to improve data mining and machine learning over time for analysis and security applications. More concrete applications for Drone Net include UTM integration with ATC and UAM, but also airspace safety and security for campus and public venues in general. Herein, we will present our experimental design and current test data from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in collaboration with University of Colorado Boulder toward completing the open specification for ground and flight instruments. We would additionally like to invite others to participate in growing the network and the data available for UTM, UAM, and GA shared airspace research.

AB In this paper, the authors design a wearable gesture recognition system that identifies the alphabetic gestures in the American Sign Language (ASL) efficiently, requiring minimal user calibration. The system uses a heterogeneous collection of sensors, viz., contact, flex and inertial, placed strategically on the hand to record movements and points of contact involved during gesture signing. In order to minimize user calibration, the authors propose a novel approach called as State-based gesture modelling, which requires only 7 gestures to be signed by a user to create a State-based model for all 26 alphabetic gestures in ASL for that user. A multi-stage gesture recognition algorithm, which uses the user-calibrated State-based model, is employed for gesture identification. The system was extensively tested for 2 trained and 1 amateur ASL signers for up to 150 times per gesture giving maximum efficiencies of 92% and 81% respectively, thus indicating the robustness of the system. The use of an elegant algorithm along with simple off-the-shelf sensors enabled the implementation of the entire system on an ATmega 328P microcontroller, resulting in a cost of 25 USD for a laboratory stage prototype.

AB During the last decade, many climatic parameters are more and more deviating from the mean values calculated over historical climatic time-series. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) stated that years 2015, 2016 and 2017 were the warmest since 1850. According to the preliminary data analysis of the last year, this trend is going to continue in 2018 as well. These climatic changes have accelerated the occurrence of droughts in many parts of the world including Europe and Asia. The North Western region is one such region in Sri Lanka which always affected by droughts due to its inherent dry weather condition. Although drought is considered as a normal part of the climate, its increasing negative impacts on human activities and the environment urges the application of novel technologies in drought monitoring. The 4onse project (analysis of Open, Non-conventional, Sustainable and Effective monitoring systems), funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), is a project began in this context to address the aforementioned mentioned issues by deploying 27 open technologies based Environmental Monitoring Systems (EMS) in Deduru Oya basin of Sri Lanka. These systems measure weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, pressure, rainfall, wind speed and wind direction. Thanks to the collected data, it was possible to calculate some drought indexes to evaluate the intensity of the dry periods. The Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) has been selected as the principal indicator to evaluate droughts by integrating the 4onse data together with Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) dataset.

AB With regard to the growing number of older adults, it needs smart solutions for fall prevention. Especially at geriatric institutions, the risk of falling is very high and frequently leads to injuries, resulting in serious consequences. We present the Inexpensive Node for Bed Exit Detection (INBED), a comprehensive signaling system for fall prevention. The INBED system is based on a wireless sensor network infrastructure via IEEE802.15.4 and highly-specialized open hardware in-house developed wearable. The device, which will be attached to the patients, can detect several types of movement. Occurring events are forwarded to the nursing staff immediately by using the self-organizing and scalable network including wide area network integration. The system can help to relieve the staff while the personal freedom of movement and privacy of patients is increased. With this development, the energy-efficient, simple and intuitive mechanisms of proximity communication can be combined with broadband benefits.

AB Control and monitoring of experimental facilities as well as laboratory equipment requires handling a blend of different tasks. Often in industrial or scientific fields there are standards or form factor to comply with and electronic interfaces or custom busses to adopt. With such tight boundary conditions, the integration of an off-the-shelf Single Board Computer (SBC) is not always a possible or viable alternative. The availability of electronic schematics and PCBs with open-source Hardware license for various SBCs overcomes such integration problems, making feasible the implementation of a custom architecture composed by a central core inherited from a vendor reference design (most likely the microprocessor, static RAM and flash memory) augmented with application-specific integrated circuits and hardware resources, in order to handle the requirements of the specific environment. The user is then able to exploit most of the supported tools and software provided by open-source community, fulfilling all the constraints enforced by his environment. We have used such an approach for the design and development of the monitoring system of the endcap electromagnetic calorimeter of the Belle II experiment, presently running at KEK Laboratory (Tsukuba, Japan). Here we present and discuss the main aspects of the hardware architectures and noise performances tailored on the needs of a detector designed around CsI crystal scintillators.

AB Modern innovative concepts around Digital Information and Communication Technologies (DICTs), like Industry 4.0, the Internet of Things or Smart Grids, are impacting the scientific and technological worlds and, hence, in control and automation arenas. These trends involve networked interconnection and continuous data flow between a number of hardware and software actors. In parallel, open source technology has gained increasing attention from last years, especially due to the widespread presence of the open source hardware Arduino microcontroller. Focusing on industrial advanced frameworks, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are required to exchange data with new smart devices, sensors and/or actuators. Arduino boards are commonly used as development platforms for such smart devices. Therefore, communication solutions must be designed towards the convergence of open source hardware and widely used traditional SCADA-devoted software. This paper presents a system that seamlessly integrates Arduino boards into a LabVIEW-based SCADA system through Ethernet connection. The open connectivity provided by the Open Platform Communications (OPC) protocol enables such integration. The proposed framework is a novelty in scientific literature. The development of the system is reported and initial results are provided to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposal.

AB This project serves to design and fabricate a robotic arm that imitates the movements of a biological human arm. The open source design was modified, and individual parts were 3D printed for assembly. Servo-motors act as the muscles, pulling nylon strings connected to the fingers that will perform hand gestures. The Myo Armband is used to collect the electromyographic (EMG) signals from the forearm of the test subject to train an artificial neural network (ANN) having 35 different classes consisting of the American Sign Language. Once the Artificial Neural Network is trained, it was used in real-time classification to make predictions the robotic arm. Using a two-layer feed forward network, accuracies for offline training reached a recognition rate of 94.7 percent. Previous prosthetic advancement has been too expensive for the general population. Our goal is to build an inexpensive alternative.

ID EMERGENCY
AB Humanitarian response often addresses the basic human needs which include safe, sanitary, hazard free environment. From the war torn countries to remote communities, untreated household waste water creates living conditions directly affecting human welfare. We present an IoT enabled, semi industrial, mobile waste water treatment solution targeted for communities in remote sub-Arctic regions without a centralized sewer system or a waste water treatment facility. The open source hardware and software platforms were implemented on an Arduino Mega and Raspberry Pi to operate a household water reuse system. The water reuse system was developed as part of the Alaska Water and Sewer Challenge to address a cost effective alternative to piped water and sewer service in unserved remote Alaskan Communities. The semi-industrial water treatment system was controlled using the internet enabled Arduino Mega and Raspberry Pi components-off-the-shelf (COTS) that allowed for both on-site and remote control. While implemented as a proof-of-concept of a treatment system to evaluate existing waste water technology, the production model can take full advantage of the internet of things concepts that would allow for proactive maintenance scheduling, optimized treatment time to meet available community electrical loads, and remote troubleshooting and operation to name a few.

AB The commoditization of powerful, portable and affordable mobile communications devices has transformed disaster response and remote data collection. Where in the past field workers would fill in damage assessment and other forms using pencil and paper, there are now a wide variety of digital tools that can run on low-cost smartphones and tablets, and have the potential to capture information in real-time, and make it available to decision makers. Also, such devices allow operational agencies to more effectively track their field teams, to ensure that they remain as safe as possible at all times.
   However, this transformation is not complete, and not without challenges. In particular, keeping digital devices powered, connected and secure are recurring themes. While a variety of solutions already exist in this space, they are not without their draw-backs. For example, energy can be supplied by carrying additional batteries and solar panels, which means carrying more devices. Communications can be enabled in remote areas by using a BGAN satellite internet terminal, however these are bulky, expensive to buy and even more expensive to operate costing as much as $1 every two seconds. Iridium Short Burst Data (SBD) is a cheaper and smaller alternative, but still requires carrying an extra device, and the very low data rates it provides are very limiting. Maintaining security on tablets and phones is a problem well known for it complexities and pitfalls, including the lack of long-term vendor support. Indeed, the rapid evolution of tablets and phones presents difficulties in ensuring that the required capabilities remain compatible and well integrated with the evolving operating systems of these devices.
   We therefore propose that there exists a gap for a device that is more specifically tailored to the requirements of humanitarian and remote field work. Such a device should ideally be a single physical device that is self-sufficient for both energy and remote communications, and that is radically easier to secure, and can be supported over the long-term, without the need to continually modify the desired applications, just to keep them running.
   We present our work on creating exactly such a device: A tablet-like device that includes cellular, satellite, UHF packet radio and mesh communications capabilities, is radically simpler to secure, and is an open-design that can be used and supported over many years, without requiring unaffordable non-returnable engineering costs. Specifically, we present proof-of-concept hardware, and decisive evidence that despite the relatively low computational performance, that it remains capable enough to meet a number of identified use-cases.

AB A methodology of open design of adaptive information models for production management under uncertainty, based on a cognitive approach and taking into account the human factor, is developed. This methodology is based on the idea of designing a variety of adaptive information models based on a single basic model. In this case, a variety of adaptation procedures that are publicly available can be used. As an example, information models based on self-learning procedures are considered. The results of the operation of these models are adaptive parameters (norms) and production estimates. When designing such models, it can be used many of the formal self-learning procedures described in the scientific and technical literature. As an example, the self-learning information model for production management based on a stochastic approximation designed. Sufficient conditions for its correctness are found, which ensure the unfolding of the production potential taking into account the human factor. The application of the self-learning information model is illustrated by the example of wagon-repair production of large-scale corporation Russian Railways. (C) 2019 The Authors.

DE Open Design; Community-based; Digital Platform; Wikipedia
AB Open Design (OD) is characterized as fast-growing community-based generative process, that is supported in a digital repository or platform, in order to develop a specific topic area or field. Many examples of OD are available nowadays, from software (probably the most common) to hardware, and from science and technology to business. One of the most known platforms of OD is an open editable content encyclopedia, the Wikipedia. Trough the involvement of volunteers (community that do not receive any payment for the work) in writing articles in a collaborative way was possible to develop, most probably, the extensive multi-language encyclopedia in the World started from scratch within 18 years. Based on analysis made from available Wikipedia statistical data, it is possible to conclude that from a stochastic behaviour the variables reached a transition phase in which a presence of a hysteresis between all variables were reached in between 60 to 80 months, and the editors (agents of the community) are an important asset for the system "transformation".

AB Many of the developments started by social initiatives (bottom-up), others are induced by policies (top-down) or even by both (social and political). Open Design is mainly characterized as a movement generated by and for the community but could also be nourished by private/associative initiatives with the community support, and could be encourage by public entities that perceives Open Design as a flourish method for innovation and leading for a real democratization of the manufacturing.
   In this paper, three CAD software based on Open Design (rattleCAD, BRL CAD and FreeCAD) are evaluated, according to the number of downloads made in SourceFourge, in order to better understand the usage behavior of these CAD systems. The main findings suggest instability in the short range and stability in the medium and long range, indicating that the communities are active and providing attractive solutions.

AB Recently, Electric Vehicles (EVs) have gained an important research relevance as a mean of transport efficient and sustainable. In this full research to practice paper, we expose the educational experience to develop the different nodes such as lighting system, driver-focused Human Machine Interface (HMI), battery balancing and air conditioning with solar panels for EOLO, the first Colombian (EV) with an additional system of charge through wind for the auxiliary batteries which guarantees the autonomy of the vehicle. Twelve students (n=12) have been enrolled into the methodology of Problem-Based Learning (PBL) to design and implement the mentioned nodes as part of a set of capstone projects. To technical level, each node has been designed using Digital Signal Controllers (dsPICs), the open hardware platform Arduino or FTDI 32-bit microcontrollers as the FT900Q according to the design requirements. Also, it has designed several educational materials in the e-learning tool Xerte and an Algorithm Visualization (AV) tool called DSCBlocks that supported the educational process of the students. The outcomes show that the methodology is suitable to fulfill with the technical and educational requirements of the projects because they enclosed different stages such as problem definition, design strategy, usage of previous knowledge, implementation, debugging and team working. In addition, an assessment of the educational methodology is provided in the manuscript with the discussion of its implications for learning in the students.

AB Measurelt-ARCH is A GNU GPL licensed, dimension, annotation, and drawing tool for use in the open source software Blender. By providing free and open tools for the reading and editing of architectural drawings, Measurlt-ARCH allows works of architecture to be shared, read, and modified by anyone. The digitization of architectural practice over the last 3 decades has brought with it a new set of inter-disciplinary discourses for the profession. An attempt to utilise 'Open-Source' methodologies, co-opted from the world of software development, in order to make high quality design more affordable, participatory and responsible has emerged. The most prominent of these discussions are embodied in Carlo Raitti and Mathew Claudel's manifesto 'Open-Source Architecture' (Ratti 2015) and affordable housing initiatives like the Wikihouse project (Parvin 2016). Measurlt-ARCH aims to be the first step towards creating a completely Open-Source design pipeline, by augmenting Blender to a level where it can be used produce small scale architectural works without the need for any proprietary software, serving as an exploratory critique on the user experience and implementations of industry standard dimensioning tools that exist on the market today.

AB This paper explores the development of design procedures in relationship to their digital proceedings, in order to interface human movement and parametric design procedures. The research studied the use of Leap Motion controller, a gesture recognition device using infrared sensors combined with time-based generative tools in Rhinoceros Grasshopper. A physical, artistic procedure was used as a reference to model a digital design procedure, including a series of parametric definitions combined with them in an attempt to produce complex three-dimensional designs in real time. In a later stage of this research, a modular, open source, digitizing arm was developed to capture hand movement and interact with an autonomous parametric definition, augmenting even more the range of applications of dexterity-based digital design. The challenge of this experimental investigation lies in the negotiation of the designer's needs for a complex yet open design process and the possibilities of defined soft- and hardware solutions.

AB User-centred approaches as a designer, as well as open design and citizen science present challenges for our students in setting up their competences. In recent years, our School of Design has endeavoured to incorporate proposals close to these movements, which come from local and national agents working in contexts of greater social and environmental complexity. The research, supported by a case study, has served to contrast the following hypothesis: there is a change in the role of our students in this type of approach that broadens their capacities, leading them to become mediators and facilitators in the framework of Citizen Science Design projects. The article has been organised as follows, a brief introduction on the background of the project and the research, a description of the project and above all of the changes observed in its role, to end with a discussion of the results in relation to the theoretical framework. The last point is dedicated to the conclusions, pointing out the need to examine in greater depth these projects that seem to have a positive impact on the skills of our product students.

AB With the Internet-of-Things revolution, the security assessment against implementation attacks has become a critical concern not only for hardware accelerators but also for embedded CPUs executing cryptographic primitives. Starting from an FPGA implementation of the open-hardware ORPSoC system-on-chip running a software version of the AES, this paper explores two implications of the side-channel information leakage that impact the hardware design of general purpose computing platforms. First, we explore the mapping between the side-channel information leakage and the microarchitectural components that are contributing to it. Second, we discuss the variations in the observability of the side-channel information leakage at post-synthesis and post-implementation levels of the FPGA hardware design flow.

AB This paper reports on the development of ongoing research into the systematic study of human values in software engineering (SE). Firstly, we outline the rationale for this work, highlighting the significance of human values in SE and the need for both a more structured approach to their study and tools to support their articulation in the SE domain. We then explain our theoretical framework, which draws on social psychology research on values. Secondly, we introduce tools designed in line with this framework and the context of their use so far. Our tools adopt a variety of research methods, including structured mixed-method techniques, such as the 'Values Q-Sort' (V-QS), and more open design-based methods, such as the 'Values Probes'. Given the multi-faceted nature of the topic, we argue that a combination of qualitative, quantitative and design thinking techniques is a necessary step for the study of human values in SE; and that these methods should be both a) robust and replicable, and b) creative and provocative. Finally, we highlight the potential applications of our tools in SE industry and education.

AB The power efficiency of photovoltaic modules is highly correlated with their health status. Under dynamically changing environments, photovoltaic defects could spontaneously form and develop into fatal faults during the daily operation of photovoltaic plants. To facilitate defect detection with less human intervention, a non-destructive and contactless visual inspection system with the help of unmanned aerial vehicles and edge computing is proposed in this work. Limited by the resources of edge devices and the availability of images of photovoltaic defects for training, we developed an online solution combined with deep learning, data argumentation and transfer learning to properly address the issues of running resource hungry applications on edge devices and lack of training samples faced by the deep learning approaches used in the field. With the reduction of the network depth of the deep convolutional neural network model and the transfer of features from the learned defects, the resource consumption of our proposed approach is significantly reduced, and thus can be used on a wide range of edge devices to complete defect detection in a timely manner with high accuracy. To study the performance of our design, a testbed was built from open source hardware and software, and field trials were carried out in three photovoltaic plants. The experimental results clearly demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of our design for detecting visible defects on photovoltaic modules.

AB Recent technological advances are completely reshaping the way we build our cities, and the way we enjoy them. Future smart cities will employ a number of smart sensors, which cooperatively work to deliver advanced services that improve security and quality of life. The capability of deploying and testing such technologies directly on-the-field is paramount to research, however comes with a significant effort in terms of time and price. For this reason, we introduce an open-source design framework for highly-connected smart sensors, and we implemented it in an advanced controller for traffic light, providing a single component to support researchers and engineers from the earliest stages of development in laboratories till on-the-field research and testing.

AB This paper provides the design of a novel open-hardware mini-bipedal robot, named Rapid-Prototyped Remote-Brain BiPed (RPRP), that is developed to provide a low-cost and reliable platform for locomotion and perception research. The robot is made of customized 3D-printed material (ABS plastic) and electronics, and commercial Robotics Dynamixel MX-28 actuators, as well as visual RGB-D and MU sensing systems. We show that the robot is able to perform some locomotion/visual-odometry tasks and it is easy to switch between different feet designs, providing also a novel Center-of-Pressure (CoP) sensing system, so that it can deal with various types of terrain. Moreover, we provide a description of its control and perception system architecture, as well as our open source software packages that provide sensing and navigation tools for locomotion and visual odometry on the robot. Finally, we briefly discuss the transferability of some prototype research that has been done on the developed mini-biped, to half or full-size humanoid robots, such as COMAN or WALK-MAN.

AB In recent years, quadcopters have become popular research platforms in the fields of robotics and control engineering. As a response to the academic community's needs, several open-source hardware and software platforms have emerged with the aim to impose as de-facto development tools. One of these platforms is represented by Crazyflie 2.0, a nano class quadcopter that was used in research projects that span from control architecture designs to high-level swarm synchronization.
   This paper presents a study of the control architecture employed in the stock firmware. Based on the mathematical model, the dynamic behaviour is thoroughly evaluated to understand the deviation between ideal and real evolution. A comprehensive phase of parameters tuning is conducted and multiple scenarios for real-time testing are employed. These scenarios comply in tracking predefined patterns, the quadcopter's evolution being tracked via a RGB-D sensor.
   The proposed evaluation procedure can be easily replicated and represents a very important step in obtaining accurate real-time results.

AB Swarm robotics is a relatively new research field that employs multiple robots (tens, hundreds or even thousands) that collaborate on complex tasks. There are several issues which limit the realworld application of swarm robotic scenarios, e.g. autonomy time, communication methods, and cost of commercialised robots. We present a platform, which aims to overcome the aforementioned limitations while using off-the-shelf components and freely-available software. The platform combines (i) a versatile open-hardware micro-robot capable of local and global communication, (ii) commercially-available wireless charging modules which provide virtually unlimited robot operation time, (iii) open-source marker-based robot tracking system for automated experiment evaluation, (iv) and a LCD display or a light projector to simulate environmental cues and pheromone communication. To demonstrate the versatility of the system, we present several scenarios, where our system was used.

AB This paper describes the design, manufacture, and performance of a highly dexterous, low-profile, 7 Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) robotic arm for CT-guided percutaneous needle biopsy. Direct CT guidance allows physicians to localize tumours quickly; however, needle insertion is still performed by hand. This system is mounted to a fully active motion stage superior to the patient's head and teleoperated by a radiologist. Unlike other similar robots, this robot's fully serial-link approach uses a unique combination of belt and cable drives for high-transparency and minimal-backlash, allowing for an expansive working area and numerous approach angles to targets, all while maintaining a small in-bore cross-section of less than 16cm(2). Simulations verified the system's expansive collision free work-space and ability to hit targets across the entire chest, as required for lung cancer biopsy. Targeting error was on average < 1mm on a teleoperated accuracy task, illustrating the system's sufficient accuracy to perform biopsy procedures. While this system was developed for lung biopsies, it can be easily modified for other CT-guided needle based procedures. Additionally, this system is open-hardware.(1)

AB We present RoFICoM, a new retractable connection device that allows for mechanical, electric, and data communication connection between separable robotic modules. The device is intentionally designed to be used in lattice-type metamorphic robots, however, its applicability is much wider. The main novelty of our solution lies primarily in a new unique flat design and spatial compactness of the connector. With a flat connector, much more space is left for the body of a robotic module in the structure. Moreover, the connector is also fully self-contained device with well defined mechanical, electrical and data interfaces, hence it can be easily embedded in various robotic solutions. Our RoFICoM connector is easy to produce, it is open-hardware and free for non-commercial use. In the paper, we give construction details and report on a couple of experiments we performed to demonstrate key features of the connection achieved with two RoFICoM devices.

AB Keeping an algal culture at a constant turbidity requires expensive and complex devices. We designed a low-cost, user friendly but also highly configurable phototurbidostat using 3D-printing, open-source software and electronics. The device is able to monitor in real time a culture in photobioreactor, and dynamically adjust the conditions to maintain the turbidity at a desired value. It can accommodate to a large set of volumes or laboratory equipments with little effort thanks to its modular and scalable design. Each module (such as light, pumps or sensors) are autonomous and controllable via Wi-Fi. Furthermore, our phototurbidostat is fully open-source and can be remotely controlled by a smartphone or a computer via a web-based graphical user interface. Finally, the device can be reproduced easily for a cost ranging between 1/20th and 1/50th of the price of a classical commercial device.

AB Two main approaches are currently prevalent in the digital emulation of musical instruments: manipulation of pre-recorded samples and techniques of real-time synthesis, generally based on physical models with varying degrees of accuracy. Concerning the first, while the processing power of present-day computers enables their use in real-time, many restrictions arising from this sample-based design persist; the huge on disk space requirements and the stiffness of musical articulations being the most prominent. On the other side of the spectrum, pure synthesis approaches, while offering greater flexibility, fail to capture and reproduce certain nuances central to the verisimilitude of the generated sound, offering a dry, synthetic output, at a high computational cost. We propose a method where ensembles of lightweight neural networks working in parallel are learned, from crafted frequency-domain features of an instrument sound spectra, an arbitrary instrument's voice and articulations realistically and efficiently. We find that our method, while retaining perceptual sound quality on par with sampled approaches, exhibits 1/10 of latency times of industry standard real-time synthesis algorithms, and 1/100 of the disk space requirements of industry standard sample-based digital musical instruments. This method can, therefore, serve as a basis for more efficient implementations in dedicated devices, such as keyboards and electronic drumkits and in general purpose platforms, like desktops and tablets or open-source hardware like Arduino and Raspberry Pi. From a conceptual point of view, this work highlights the advantages of a closer integration of machine learning with other subjects, especially in the endeavor of new product development. Exploiting the synergy between neural networks, digital signal processing techniques and physical modelling, we illustrate the proposed method via the implementation of two virtual instruments: a conventional grand piano and a hibrid stringed instrument.

AB This work studied different digital embedded platforms which can be programmed using Arduino IDE software and which can be used for digital control and data acquisition applications. Specifically three kind of Arduino Board (Arduino UNO, Arduino Mega y Arduino Due) and two ESP based board (ESP8622 and ESP32) are evaluated and compared. The comparison is based on the execution time of mathematical operations and a function required for data acquisition or digital control and includes (z) digital ports writing, (ii) analog signal acquisition, (iii) execution of mathematic operation in integer and float format, and (iv) the execution of the data processing code. The execution time is measured by using a methodology which is simple to implement for any other digital device. Because of each platform uses its own Arduino DUE library to generate the assembly code for its own microcontroller, the instructions adopted for both generating the actions to measure and generating the testing signals are written using Arduino IDE commands and using instructions that any entry-level user may adopt. In conclusion, from the experimental results it is observed the high difference in the execution time of the different platforms, especially between ESPx boards and Arduino boards.

AB Arduino is an open-source hardware and software single-board microcontroller for building digital devices and interactive objects. Arduino boards are available commercially in preassembled form or as do-it-yourself kits. The price of the board is relatively low, which is a key advantage for educational purposes.
   The current paper describes the experiences about the use of an Arduino-based device in the chemical lab for temperature and pH monitoring and remote data logging. Furthermore, the capability of the Arduino was used to implement an automatic microcontroller for the experiment's temperature and pH. The assembled device was designed for monitoring and control chemical processes that require pH and temperature control, such as e.g. a chemical reaction carried out in a continuous stirred-tank reactor.
   The pH is controlled by the addition of acid or base to the reaction mixture. When the device detects that the pH is beyond or below certain pre-defined threshold limits, it activates electro-valves that inject the controlling substance to the system. Temperature control was designed for both exothermic and endothermic processes, using heaters and fans as well as controlling the flow of a refrigeration jacket.
   The practical exercise of assembling the microcontroller had good acceptance from the students, who had to practice multidisciplinary skills, such as programming, electronics, chemistry, chemical engineering and design of experiments. A calibration procedure was included to increase the reliability of the results, which also helped to consolidate the theoretical aspects of analytical chemistry and experiments control.

AB There is a growing interest in the open-source hardware movement to amortize non-recurring engineering costs by using plug-and-play system-on-chip (SoC) designs, where the communication among different components is provided by an on-chip interconnection network. Unfortunately, building an on-chip network (OCN) that is suitable for a specific SoC design requires the exploration of a large number of design options and involves diverse research methodologies to evaluate performance, area, energy, and timing. In this paper, we propose PyOCN, a unified framework that vertically integrates multiple research methodologies to enable productively exploring the OCN design space. PyOCN is the first comprehensive framework for modeling (e.g., functional-level, cycle-level, and register-transfer-level), testing (e.g., unit testing, integration testing, and property-based random testing), and evaluating (e.g., simulating, generating, and characterizing) on-chip interconnection networks.

AB The work presented in this paper takes place in the design initiatives that have emerged to thwart BadUSB threats [59]. Though many attempts were focusing on the host side, by enhancing the operating system's USB sub-module robustness [78, 80] or by adding a proxy between the host and the device [6, 53], we have chosen to focus our efforts on the device side. More specifically, our work presents the WooKey platform, a custom highly secure USB thumb drive with mass storage capabilities, designed for user data encryption and protection, and embedding a full-fledged set of in-depth defenses. The device encloses a firmware with a secure DFU (Device Firmware Update) implementation using up-to-date cryptography as well as an external and extractable authentication token based on a secure element. The runtime software security is built upon EwoK, an innovative open source microkernel designed for microcontrollers with advanced security and performance in mind. Finally, another strength of the project is its core guiding principle: provide an open source and open hardware platform [3] using off-the-shelf components.

AB Recently, with the development of artificial intelligence technology, robots have been utilized not only in manufacturing but also in many industrial fields. The needs of customers have been diversified and the trend of future manufacturing has been changing from the conventional mass production to the multi-product small volume production system. In a smart factory environment for custom manufacturing, the robot must be manually programmed for each work instruction every time, especially when a production product is changed. Robot programming takes a lot of time and effort of people. In this paper, we propose a method to automatically measure the product information(color, size) automatically which are 3D printed out based on HSV (hue, saturation, value) Color Space and to control the auto grasping of robots. Also, we applied this control system to the FaaS(Factory As a Service) testbed for functional verification.

AB This paper presents a new multi-agent framework using open-source software (MAFOSS). The proposed framework is a modular and cost-effective open-source hardware and software platform that is intended to help develop multi-agent systems for research and education. Numerous multi-agent platforms have been developed in the literature to date that are used in various robotic applications, such as surveillance, target localization, cooperative estimation, among others. However, most of them are either tailored towards particular applications or driven by expensive software and hardware. The proposed MAFOSS system is developed for robotic applications, where a team of mobile agents (robots) is deployed to achieve a common goal. A major contribution of the MAFOSS system is the development of an open-hardware platform for differential-drive mobile robots (herein called "eduMOD" mobile robots). The software architecture of the current framework mostly relies on the robot operating system (ROS). Regardless of internal hardware and/or software architecture, appropriate actions can be applied to actuators of an individual or a team of mobile agents for controlling their motions. A few case studies have been conducted to evaluate the performance of MAFOSS.

AB The Abbe School of Photonics (ASP) provides photonics education of graduate and doctoral students at the Friedrich Schiller University in Jena, Germany. The main instrument for training students in optical sciences is a Master's degree program, which is open to international students, research-oriented and supported by German photonics industry. In this context, a conceptually new open lab Makerspace for photonics was established to support both the internal students in the realization of innovative and creative processes, as well as to build a strong and curious community of like-minded people from outside of the university. The photonics Makerspace provides all tools and materials needed to setup state-of-the-art optical instruments. Furthermore, it provides technical mentoring, open workshops and lectures. Partners from the photonics industry corroborate the process of making by well-established open innovation schemes and are integrated into the Makerspace with hackathon and innovation camp formats where the Makerspace users work on industry challenges. Finished and ongoing projects are transformed into freely accessible, open source hardware while a commercial exploitation of the projects is supported. Out of the broad topical spectrum of ongoing projects, two quite advanced examples are a low-cost smartphone-based 3D-scanner with a cloud-based, free software and a high-resolution microscope built of 3D-printed modules. For these projects, apart from hardware and software, also workshops and lectures are available. Other examples include a drone for medical applications in search and rescue, a smartphone-based lithography setup, a Raman-spectrometer, a camera array for meteorite detection, and many more. All activities of the Makerspace are scientifically investigated with special attention on the interaction between open innovation approaches and the Maker scene. Here, we will share our insights into potentials and opportunities offered by this novel educative approach.

DE Instructional design; MOOCs; transliteracy; transactional distance;
   tutoring
AB In this paper, we apply Instructional-design theories and case study methodology to examine the design and actions of facilitators in a cMOOC (Connectivist Massive Online Open Course). We verified that the Instructional-design project, combined with the actions of the facilitators, applied successful strategies based on transliteracies to reduce transactional distance.
   The concept of transliteracy encompasses the concept of digital literacies because it comprises skills to deal with technologies and, moreover, it focuses on the meaning-making and movement within complex informational contexts, observing the fluency of movement across information fields, e.g. while we surf the web.
   In the analyzed object, the environment design, the interaction design and the informational structure of the course used an informational flow in network. Therefore, parts of the content has spread to other spaces, such as institutional sites, sharing platforms, the Twitter microblog, student blogs, etc. This informational flow required students to practice transliteracies by clicking on hyperlinks, visiting pages, producing and sharing connections, and returning to online course spaces.
   However, the fluency of this movement was not limited to the students. Based on the concept of transliteracies, we examined the movement within the network spaces of the course, focusing on the transit of the facilitators. This investigation identified that the informational structure configurations and the facilitators' conduct attenuated the transactional distance. Connected Courses employed transliteracies to reshape the three key elements of transactional distance: predetermined course structure, student autonomy, and dialogue with tutors.
   Firstly, we verified that, while environment design and informational structure has become more open, flexible, and less predetermined, it resulted in greater student autonomy. The student was free to move between contents, to explore the affordances of the interfaces involved, to discover and suggest new connections to peers, stimulating an authentic learning experience.
   Secondly, the tutor-student interaction design included a proximal conduct of the educator. Regarding the dialogue, the transliteracies were applied by the facilitators in a systematic exchange project with the participants, crossing the forum platforms, Twitter, Blogs and virtual spaces. Facilitators were constantly visiting student blogs, replying to posts, commenting on posts; they also shared student-led content on the course's official blog and on the communicational channel on Twitter. Besides, they also interacted, answering and tagging / calling students in Twitter conversations.
   This attitude of the facilitators resulted in a redirection of the interactive flow between tutor and student. This motion of the tutor, which leaves the course's official platform and moves towards the students' direction, seeking for them, interacting on more informal platforms, is a movement that softens the educational hierarchy. This motion of the tutor towards the student highlights the contribution and participation of students. Thus, it is successful in stimulating engagement and reducing the transactional distance between the parties.
   The results show that the open design, the spread informational structure and the transliteracy of tutors had beneficial effects to favor the sense of belonging, of involvement with the course, and of student engagement, stimulating greater participation and delivery of activities.

AB This paper presents a new framework for the development of an ROV (Remote Operated Vehicle) as a final tangible objective, but also important is the creation of a team to get it.
   In recent years, the investment on the ROVs has increased significantly. Moreover, the number of underwater investigations has advanced constantly, in the fields of submarine environments, marine geology, chemical, naval engineering, among many others. The ROV was born because of the needed for a resource in these investigations. This equipment must be capable and efficient into this environment, the underwater one.
   At present, there is a large list of ROVs, provided with more efficiency and features, but the cost is relatively expensive. The primary objective of this project is to create a low-cost ROV for investigations with a low budget. For these reasons, the design of this ROV uses Open Hardware and Open Software. Furthermore, the structure and the electronic components of the ROV are designed with cheap materials which are also easy to be found, as far as possible.
   The addition of different specific projects, set the methodology to create a big project incorporated these specific projects, compose part of the vehicle submarine. Every part is revised by the teacher of this knowledge area involved in the project.
   At present, the project continues developing and growing. For the students, the possibility of forming part of this project is a great opportunity to apply the knowledge achieved along their studies to a common project, and create a multidisciplinary working team with a common goal to attain from different areas of knowledge. It has also provided the students with the opportunity of extending the project into their final degree project, Master thesis and PhD thesis, respectively.
   Finally, collaboration among different areas of knowledge is essential. As a result, the creation of a multidisciplinary group of teachers and students, have been collaborating towards obtaining an operative ROV. The areas involved in this project are: science and navigation techniques, shipbuilding, robotics, mechanics, electronics, Computer Science, hydrodynamics, automatics, ... Therefore, the project team has been composed of teachers and students from the Computer Science, Radioelectronic Engineering and Shipbuilding Engineering fields of the University of Cadiz.

AB We present a vertical integration of a real-time Industrial Internet of Things environment with Cloud computing functionalities. We designed our testbed to implement self-adaptive wings for motorbikes using pressure values sensed in specific locations of the motorbike as input data collected exploiting open-hardware devices called OpenMotes which communicate through a low-power, delay-constrained wireless network based on the 6LoWPAN protocol stack. Our real-time on-board unit elaborates the data, and it computes the new angle of attack of two wings. The total response time of the system is in the order of 100 ms and meets the real-time requirements that constrains our scenario. Finally, we integrate our system with Cloud functionalities that we use for storing the acquired data on a time-series database.

These features allow small users as well as industries to design, develop and build wide range of applications with efficiency as the common aspect. A number of platforms that integrate this kind of technology were also proposed by different manufacturers, some employing the open hardware concept. Embedded applications spread over a wide range of fields, which make them hard to characterize in a general sense. For this reason, benchmark suites are often used as a tool for system's performance evaluation. However, such suites consist on a large number of different algorithms, which can spend time and energy to run on SoC computers. In order to contribute to the performance assessment of such systems, this paper presents a simple method for comparing different platforms, based on execution time of simple but representative algorithms: sorting, cross-correlation and discrete-cosine transform calculation for vectors. The power consumption was also considered. Six distinct architectures were used as a case study. Several computer experiments were conducted in order to make possible a statistic characterization of different load conditions in distinct platforms, so their comparison can be done in a meaningful way. Results show that the proposed method provides a good estimation of relative system performance, which can be useful as a criterion choice for selecting different embedded platforms.

AB Testbeds are a key tool for evaluating and benchmarking IoT solutions. Several public testbeds are being run by institutions around the world. These are built with a variety of tools, and are typically "heavy" installations with dedicated wiring, hard installations, switches, servers, and a reservation and experiment management back-end. To complement those, we have taken the opposite, minimalistic, approach in designing the OpenTestBed. The OpenTestBed features all the tools necessary to build a testbed from off-the-shelf components such as Raspberry Pi single-board computers, OpenMote B low-power wireless devices, and glass domes. Each TestBox in the testbed connects to an MQTT broker over WiFi, no dedicated wiring or back-end is needed. The Inria-Paris OpenTestBed testbed of 80 motes has cost only 9,480 euros, and is open-access. The OpenTestBed is a fully open-source and open-hardware project, which several institutions have already adopted.

AB In this paper we present an Internet-of-Things (IoT) network implementation developed as part of the project "Enhanced Physical Layer for Cellular IoT" (EPHYL), using FIT/CorteXlab radio testbed. The aim of our work is to provide a customizable and open source design for IoT networks prototyping in a massive multi-user, synchronized and reproducible environment thanks to the hardware and software capabilities of the testbed. The massive access feature is managed by emulating several sensors per radio nodes. Two categories of network components are used in our design: a base station unit and a multi-sensor emulator unit. The components are separately hosted in dedicated and remotely accessible radio nodes. Their design features can be illustrated through a live demo, which is also reproducible as it is available for any interested reader.

AB Wrist-worn devices hold great potential as a platform for mobile health (mHealth) applications because they comprise a familiar, convenient form factor and can embed sensors in proximity to the human body. Despite this potential, however, they are severely limited in battery life, storage, bandwidth, computing power, and screen size. In this paper, we describe the experience of the research and development team designing, implementing and evaluating Amulet - an open-hardware, open-software wrist-worn computing device - and its experience using Amulet to deploy mHealth apps in the field. In the past five years the team conducted 11 studies in the lab and in the field, involving 204 participants and collecting over 77,780 hours of sensor data. We describe the technical issues the team encountered and the lessons they learned, and conclude with a set of recommendations. We anticipate the experience described herein will be useful for the development of other research-oriented computing platforms. It should also be useful for researchers interested in developing and deploying mHealth applications, whether with the Amulet system or with other wearable platforms.

AB The posit number system is proposed as a replacement of IEEE floating-point numbers. It is a floating-point system that trades exponent bits for significand bits, depending on the magnitude of the numbers. Thus, it provides more precision for numbers around 1, at the expense of lower precision for very large or very small numbers. Several works have demonstrated that this trade-off can improve the accuracy of applications. However, the variable-length exponent and significand encoding impacts the hardware cost of posit arithmetic. The objective of the present work is to enable application-level evaluations of the posit system that include performance and resource consumption.
   To this purpose, this article introduces an open-source hardware implementation of the posit number system, in the form of a C++ templatized library compatible with Vivado HLS. This library currently implements addition, subtraction and multiplication for custom-size posits. In addition, the posit standard also mandates the presence of the "quire", a large accumulator able to perform exact sums of products. The proposed library includes the first open-source parameterized hardware quire.
   This library is shown to improve the state-of-the-art of posit implementations in terms of latency and resource consumption. Still, standard 32 bits posit adders and multipliers are found to be much larger and slower than the corresponding floating-point operators. The cost of the posit 32 quire is shown to be comparable to that of a Kulisch accumulator for 32 bits floating-point.

AB Ultrasound diagnostic imaging is an essential aspect of modern healthcare, but barriers such as cost, technical training, and access to medical facilities impede global adoption. To tackle these factors, the need for a portable open-source three-imensional ultrasound system is discussed. Such a system, equipped with artificial intelligence, can provide unparalleled global accessibility to life-saving affordable medical diagnostic care as well as create copious amounts of data needed for training automated systems; however, it may also carry disadvantages. This paper assesses the considerations for and against an open-ource approach and draws insights from successful open-source hardware projects in the past.

AB In the present work, a modular and low-cost FPGA-based phased array system was developed that uses transducers emitting at 40 kHz for the acoustic levitation of small objects (<= 4 mm). The system consists of a driver board, transducer arrays with various layouts, and software developed in MATLAB (R). The software can be used to simulate the acoustic field, calculate acoustic traps, and control the driver board via a provided USB-SPI interface. The driver board controls up to 100 channels simultaneously with square-wave signals up to 20 Vpp with pi/1024 phase resolution and 10 bit amplitude resolution. Several phased arrays can be linked via a provided (IC)-C-2 interface to increase the number of available channels. The functionality of the system is demonstrated by the levitation of small objects using a flat 40 kHz transducer array.

AB Modern computer systems are becoming faster, more efficient, and increasingly interconnected with each generation. Thus, these platforms grow more complex, with new features continually introducing the possibility of new bugs. Although the semiconductor industry employs a combination of different verification techniques to ensure the security of System-on-Chip (SoC) designs, a growing number of increasingly sophisticated attacks are starting to leverage cross-layer bugs. These attacks leverage subtle interactions between hardware and software, as recently demonstrated through a series of real-world exploits that affected all major hardware vendors.
   In this paper, we take a deep dive into microarchitectural security from a hardware designer's perspective by reviewing state-of-the-art approaches used to detect hardware vulnerabilities at design time. We show that a protection gap currently exists, leaving chip designs vulnerable to software-based attacks that can exploit these hardware vulnerabilities. Inspired by real-world vulnerabilities and insights from our industry collaborator (a leading chip manufacturer), we construct the first representative testbed of real-world software-exploitable RTL bugs based on RISC-V SoCs. Patching these bugs may not always be possible and can potentially result in a product recall. Based on our testbed, we conduct two extensive case studies to analyze the effectiveness of state-of-the-art security verification approaches and identify specific classes of vulnerabilities, which we call HardFails, which these approaches fail to detect. Through our work, we focus the spotlight on specific limitations of these approaches to propel future research in these directions. We envision our RISC-V testbed of RTL bugs providing a rich exploratory ground for future research in hardware security verification and contributing to the open-source hardware landscape.

AB Millions of users rely on mobile health (mHealth) apps to manage their wellness and medical conditions. Although the popularity of such apps continues to grow, several privacy and security challenges can hinder their potential. In particular, the simple fact that an mHealth app is installed on a user's phone can reveal sensitive information about the user's health. Due to Android's open design, any app, even without permissions, can easily check for the presence of a specific app or collect the entire list of installed apps on the phone. Our analysis shows that Android apps expose a significant amount of metadata, which facilitates fingerprinting them. Many third parties are interested in such information: Our survey of 2917 popular apps in the Google Play Store shows that around 57% of these apps explicitly query for the list of installed apps. Therefore, we designed and implemented HideMyApp (HMA), an effective and practical solution for hiding the presence of sensitive apps from other apps. HMA does not require any changes to the Android operating system or to apps yet still supports their key functionalities. By using a diverse dataset of both free and paid mHealth apps, our experimental evaluation shows that HMA supports the main functionalities in most apps and introduces acceptable overheads at runtime (i.e., several milliseconds); these findings were validated by our user-study (N = 30). In short, we show that the practice of collecting information about installed apps is widespread and that our solution, HMA, provides a robust protection against such a threat.

AB To be secure, cryptographic algorithms crucially rely on the underlying hardware to avoid inadvertent leakage of secrets through timing side channels. Unfortunately, such timing channels are ubiquitous in modern hardware, due to its labyrinthine fast-paths and optimizations. A promising way to avoid timing vulnerabilities is to devise-and verify-conditions under which a hardware design is free of timing variability, i.e., executes in constant-time. In this paper, we present IODINE: a clock-precise, constant-time approach to eliminating timing side channels in hardware. IODINE succeeds in verifying various open source hardware designs in seconds and with little developer effort. IODINE also discovered two constant-time violations: one in a floating-point unit and another one in an RSA encryption module.

AB A new finite-time control method based on a sliding mode for a multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is developed to improve both the transient and steady-state responses, including overshoot and steady-state error in the presence of uncertainties and external disturbances. First, a virtual control with nonlinear sliding manifolds is designed to achieve position-tracking capability, as well as to guarantee the fast convergence of the UAV to a desired position. Furthermore, an ultimate control is developed for the desired attitude-tracking performance. Various uncertainties, including torque due to the discordance between the centre of mass and rotation and wind disturbances are considered. The Lyapunov stability theorem is then applied step-by-step to prove the asymptotically stable and finite-time convergence in position and attitude controllers. Second, the proposed controller is implemented in an open-source hardware platform for a quadrotor UAV. Both numerical and experimental results are compared to validate the tracking performance for attitude and position control, as well as robustness under disturbances.

AB Due to their interdisciplinary nature, devices for controlled-environment agriculture have the possibility to turn into ideal tools not only to conduct research on plant phenology but also to create curricula in a wide range of disciplines. Controlled-environment devices are increasing their functionalities as well as improving their accessibility. Traditionally, building one of these devices from scratch implies knowledge in fields such as mechanical engineering, digital electronics, programming, and energy management. However, the requirements of an effective controlled-environment device for personal use brings new constraints and challenges. This paper presents the OpenAgT Personal Food Computer (PFC); a low cost desktop size platform, which not only targets plant phenology researchers but also hobbyists, makers, and teachers from elementary to high-school levels (K-12). The PFC is completely open-source and it is intended to become a tool that can be used for collective data sharing and plant growth analysis. Thanks to its modular design, the PFC can be used in a large spectrum of activities.

AB With the development of technologies such as the Internet of Things and Big Data, agriculture is entering the digital age. Modern information technology and intelligent equipment are the development direction of agriculture. In this paper, a remote-control system for greenhouse environment was developed based on Raspberry Pi, MySQL and Android. The system consists of a greenhouse control system (subsystem A), an environment monitoring system (subsystem B), a MySQL remote database (subsystem C), and an Android monitoring software (subsystem D). The subsystem A is used to implement automatic fertigation and collect data from subsystem B, which will be uploaded to cloud server database (subsystem C). The subsystem B is used to monitor the environmental parameters in the greenhouse such as air temperature/humidity, soil temperature/humidity etc. The subsystem C is used for storage of greenhouse environment data and communication between subsystem B and subsystem D. The subsystem D is used for data visualization including real-time display, storage and analysis of greenhouse environmental data, and remote control of fertigation system including the EC/pH control of the fertigation solution, irrigation scheduling, and fertigation settings. A proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control algorithm is used for the fertigation process of the subsystem A. The low-power LoRa technology is used for subsystem B to achieve low-power long-distance data transmission, which is especially suitable to greenhouses. All monitoring settings can be operated remotely by users. (C) 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nowadays, industrial automation systems are mostly used with proprietary hardware and software. Creating such systems requires relatively large costs. This is a problem when designing control systems with a limited budget, which are created, for example, in developing countries or small businesses. Currently, there have been opportunities to create low-cost automation systems by using solutions distributed on the basis of open-source and open-hardware. The work reviews the most important solutions and presents examples of their use in automation systems. (C) 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

DE GIS spacer; aging time; dielectric property; thermal property
AB The aging of insulation materials in GIS leads to a series of electrical problems. As a fully enclosed device, GIS faces extremely complex repairing problems once an accident occurs comparing with the separated open equipment. The root cause of this problem is multifaceted, including not only the high voltage issues, but also the environmental factors in operation such as temperature, mechanical vibration, etc. All these lead to the aging of insulation materials and the failure of the equipment. Therefore, it is important to analyze the aging state of the GIS spacer, especially the GIS spacers in service. In this paper, to evaluate the aging state of the GIS spacer in service, the structural properties, as well as electrical performance of insulating material obtained from a GIS spacer served more than 15 years are characterized and compared with that of a new GIS spacer. To investigate the change in electrical properties, dielectric loss test, polarization current, surface resistance, and partial discharge measurement are delivered. And thermal characterizations including DSC, TGA and IR are also delivered to investigate the structure change of the insulation epoxy. The results show that the aging effect reduces the surface resistances and increases the dielectric loss, polarization current and partial discharge. And with the service time increases, the glass transition temperature and the thermal decomposition temperature of the GIS spacer declines.

This paper presents our preliminary results to develop sustainable prostheses for five upper-extremity amputee patients in Colombia, South America. We utilized a patient-centric methodology, engaging patients at every stage in an effort to increase their satisfaction with their prosthetic and to assess clinical usefulness. We identified patient-specific criteria and compared existing open source hardware systems using the Design Thinking methodology. Finally, we present these data to further the development of myoelectric prosthetics as part of cyber-physical systems.

AB Nano-size unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), with few centimeters of diameter and sub-10 Watts of total power budget, have so far been considered incapable of running sophisticated visual-based autonomous navigation software without external aid from base-stations, ad-hoc local positioning infrastructure, and powerful external computation servers. In this work, we present what is, to the best of our knowledge, the first 27 g nano-UAV system able to run aboard an end-to-end, closed-loop visual pipeline for autonomous navigation based on a state-of-the-art deep-learning algorithm, built upon the open-source CrazyFlie 2.0 nano-quadrotor. Our visual navigation engine is enabled by the combination of an ultra-low power computing device (the GAP8 system-on-chip) with a novel methodology for the deployment of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We enable onboard real-time execution of a state-of-the-art deep CNN at up to 18 Hz. Field experiments demonstrate that the system's high responsiveness prevents collisions with unexpected dynamic obstacles up to a flight speed of 1.5 m/s. In addition, we also demonstrate the capability of our visual navigation engine of fully autonomous indoor navigation on a 113m previously unseen path. To share our key findings with the embedded and robotics communities and foster further developments in autonomous nano-UAVs, we publicly release all our code, datasets, and trained networks.

The authors introduced open source hardware accelerators for Curl hash function and proof-of-work computations to increase the processing rate of IOTA transactions. The structure and operation principle of both accelerators are described. Proposed accelerators have been implemented on FPGA and integrated into ARM-based System-on-Chip. The characteristics of the system have been evaluated. Compared to official software implementation the proposed hardware accelerators demonstrate x2100 speed up on the creation of IOTA transactions.

The platform's compute engine is a heterogeneous multi-core parallel ultra-low power (PULP) processor based on RISC-V, capable of delivering up to 2.5 GOPS, within a 55 mW power consumption envelope, which makes the platform ideal for battery-powered always-on operation. Experimental results show a peak of 38.3x energy efficiency increase (0.7 V, 85 MHz) compared to ARM-Cortex-M microcontrollers with similar power budgets.

DE open source design community; TOPSIS; opinion leaders
AB In order to identify the opinion leaders in open source design community, a comprehensive evaluation method of node importance based on TOPSIS is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a user collaboration network model of community organization is established by using complex social network technology. Secondly, in order to improve the accuracy of opinion leader identification, the benefit indicators and cost indicators of each node are measured. Degree centrality, median centrality and near centrality are used as the benefit indicators, meanwhile structural hole is used as the cost indicator. Then the comprehensive evaluation index of nodes is taken as the attribute of decision evaluation scheme to calculate synthetically to determine its importance in the network. On this basis, this paper takes the Local Motors community as the research object and establishes a user cooperative directed weighted network. The static topology index of the network is analyzed. According to the results, the opinion leader node of the user cooperative network is identified based on TOPSIS method. Experiments have shown that more accurate evaluation results can be obtained than using a single indicator.

AB Recent advances in positional tracking systems for virtual and augmented reality have opened up the possibilities for ubiquitous motion capture technology in the consumer market. However, for many applications such as in performance art, athletics, neuroscience, and medicine, these systems remain too bulky, expensive, and limited to tracking a few objects at a time. In this work, we present a small wireless device that takes advantage of existing HTC Vive lighthouse tracking technology to provide affordable, scalable, and highly accurate positional tracking capabilities. This open hardware and open software project contains several elements, and the latest contributions described in this paper include: (1) a characterization of the optical distortions of the lighthouses, (2) a new cross-platform WebBLE interface, and (3) a real-time in-browser visualization. We also introduce new possibilities with an adaptive calibration to estimate transformation matrices of lighthouses, and an FPGA approach to improve precision and adaptability. Finally, we show how the new developments reduce setup costs and increase the accessibility of our tracking technology.

AB Optogenetic systems enable unmatched precision for controlling molecular biological processes but require the use of specialized electrical and optical hardware. In an effort to make working with optogenetic systems more accessible, we recently described an open-source hardware platform called the Light Plate Apparatus (LPA). The LPA is a device capable of delivering two independent light signals from standard LEDs to wells of a 24-well culture plate. Basic to advanced level light programs can be created for the LPA in Iris, an easy to use, open-source web application. In this chapter, we describe each step required to build, program, and use the LPA.

AB Hearing loss is one of the most common conditions affecting older adults worldwide. Frequent complaints from the users of modern hearing aids include poor speech intelligibility in noisy environments and high cost, among other issues. However, the signal processing and audiological research needed to address these problems has long been hampered by proprietary development systems, underpowered embedded processors, and the difficulty of performing tests in real-world acoustical environments. To facilitate existing research in hearing healthcare and enable new investigations beyond what is currently possible, we have developed a modern, open-source hearing research platform, Open Speech Platform (OSP). This paper presents the system design of the complete OSP wearable platform, from hardware through firmware and software to user applications. The platform provides a complete suite of basic and advanced hearing aid features which can be adapted by researchers. It serves web apps directly from a hotspot on the wearable hardware, enabling users and researchers to control the system in real time. In addition, it can simultaneously acquire high-quality electroencephalography (EEG) or other electrophysiological signals closely synchronized to the audio. All of these features are provided in a wearable form factor with enough battery life for hours of operation in the field.

The Arduino motherboard is not only the sole peace of hardware, but it can also act as a Wi-Fi router for the devices and the laptop used for data presentation and server side computations. The server is programmed in Java programming language and is open source. Main goal was to make smart meter by the "Do It Yourself" method spending as much less founds as it is possible, by keeping user friendly interface, data validity, accuracy of measurement and ease of use for final user. Data gathering is achieved in almost 1 ms which is excellent for custom made device. However, the measured values should be calculated to RMS values to be usable for energy analyzes and further processing of information.

AB The paper describes the possibilities of data acquisition and data processing from optical sensing systems. There are some data acquisition cards and their disadvantages when used for more complex single fiber sensor systems in the paper. It is suitable to use some open source hardware because commercially available data acquisition cards are more complex and universal which means they have several different inputs/outputs and large dimensions. STEMLab 125-14 (Red Pitaya) appears to be the most suitable solution because offers 2 analog inputs and 2 analog outputs.Compare to standard data processing systems, this is supposed to be an advantage in preprocessing data using programmable logic. This can reduce the volume of transmitted data and can also speed up processing. Thus, the measurement system will be smaller and cheaper. The device contains DA converters, therefore pulses might be generated using the same clock which enables synchronization of backscatter signal.

AB Robots developed for social interaction and care show great promise as a tool to assist people. While the functionality and capability of such robots is crucial in their acceptance, the visual appearance should not be underestimated. Current designs of social robots typically can not be altered and remain the same throughout the life-cycle of the robot. Moreover, customization for different end-users is rarely taken into account and often alterations are strictly prohibited due to the closed-source designs of the manufacturer. The current trend of low-cost manufacturing (3D printing) and open-source technology, however, open new opportunities for third parties to be involved in the design process. In this work, we propose a development platform based on FreeCAD offering a parametric, modular and open-source design tool specifically aimed for robot heads. Designs can be generated by altering different features in the tool, which automatically re-configures the head. In addition, we present several design approaches that can be integrated in the design to achieve different functionality (face and skin aesthetics, component assembly), while still relying on 3D printing technology.

AB Nowadays, energy consumption and especially energy saving, are topics of great importance. Recent news regarding global warming has increased the need to save energy. In Finland, one of the major sources of energy consumption is housing. Furthermore, the heating of residential buildings accounts for up to 68% of housing energy consumption. Therefore, it is not surprising that apartment energy consumption and ways to save energy in housing are a popular research topic in Finland. In this paper, two different research areas are introduced: First, a literature survey is presented on the research subjects of energy saving in the area of real estate and housing. The goal is to gain overall knowledge of the current state of energy saving research. The overall conclusion is that knowledge of energy consumption improves efforts toward energy saving. Second, rapid prototyping with off-the-shelf devices and open source software are described. These devices are cheap to install, and a wide range of sensors are available. Consequently, it is important to deal with these topics together. The former studies provide knowledge about the usage of open hardware, open software, and open architectures with the development of prototype systems for gathering data. The literature survey gives us new information on the specialties of energy consumption measuring, offering a new area for modeling and developing prototype systems. These experiences will be taken forward and utilized in energy saving and environmentally sustainable solutions, such as Green Computing.

AB Advances in semiconductor miniaturization are an important driver for Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) since their invention in the 1980s. The increasing number of available on chip logic resources on one hand and on the other hand a decrease in part costs let the FPGA market grow steadily in recent years. It comes thus at no surprise that more and more microprocessors are integrated into programmable logic devices as they represent the central functionality in many digital systems. In parallel to these technological developments the open-source hardware community grew steadily in the last two decades. More than hundred open-source CPU cores can thus be found and selecting a core for a design project has to be done with care. In this work we thus want to focus on open-source 32-bit CPU IP cores suitable for FPGAs and which support the upcoming free and open RISC-V instruction set architecture that has some interesting advantages when compared to commercial CPU cores (as will be outlined in the paper). An overview on available projects and activities will be given and evaluation results for a selection of cores will be presented.

AB With the emerging trend of the Internet of Things and Smart City environments, new trends have arisen in building applications, too. The current approach to application development, known as monolithic architecture, is not suitable for the newest appliances. Recently, the microservice-based application architecture has emerged as a potential solution that could meet the imposed challenges. In order to educate new generations of software and IT engineers to be able to develop such microservice-based applications, educators at universities should establish an efficient platform to ensure this process. This article presents the portable and lightweight platform for teaching application development based on microservices. The platform is focused on supporting lightweight publish/subscribe messaging protocols, such as MQTT, and built-on open-source hardware development boards such as Arduino/Genuino. This Smart City learning platform is designed to enable the collaborative development of systems, applications and services for the cities of the future, and it should be efficient enough to support the learning of all the necessary skills that can be used for the development of complex and large-scale systems. The architecture of the proposed platform, as well as its elements are presented in this article.

AB Fuzzy rule-based systems (FRBSs) have been successfully applied to a wide range of real-world problems. However, they suffer from some design issues related to the difficulty to implement them on different hardware platforms without additional efforts. To bridge this gap, recently, the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society has sponsored the publication of the standard IEEE Std 1855-2016 which is aimed at providing the fuzzy community with a well-defined approach to model FRBSs in a hardware-independent way. In order to provide a runnable version of an FRBS that is designed in accordance with the IEEE Std 1855-2016, the open source library Java Fuzzy Markup Language (JFML) has been developed. However, due to hardware and/or software limitations of embedded systems, it is not always possible to run an IEEE Std 1855-2016 FRBS on this kind of systems. The aim of this paper is to overcome this drawback by developing a new JFML module that assists developers in the design and implementation of FRBSs for open hardware-embedded systems. In detail, the module supports several connection types (WiFi, Bluetooth, and USB) in order to make feasible running FRBSs in a remote computer when, due to hardware limitations, it is not possible that they run locally in the embedded systems. The new JFML module is ready for ArduinoTM and Raspberry Pi, but it can be easily extended to other hardware architectures. Moreover, the new JFML module allows to automatically generate runnable files on Arduino(TM) or Raspberry Pi in order to support nonexpert users, that is, users without specific knowledge about embedded systems or without strong programming skills. The use of the new JFML module is illustrated in two case studies. (c) 2019 The Authors. Published by Atlantis Press SARL.

AB Equipment shortages in Africa undermine Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Education. We have pioneered the LabHackathon (LabHack): a novel initiative that adapts the conventional hackathon and draws on insights from the Open Hardware movement and Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI). LabHacks are fun, educational events that challenge student participants to build frugal and reproducible pieces of laboratory equipment. Completed designs are then made available to others. LabHacks can therefore facilitate the open and sustainable design of laboratory equipment, in situ, in Africa. In this case study we describe the LabHackathon model, discuss its application in a pilot event held in Zimbabwe and outline the opportunities and challenges it presents.

ID INTELLIGENT
AB Vector similarity searching consists of comparing a query vector against a high volume of entries in a reference data set, according to a chosen similarity metric such as the L1-norm, L2-norm, or Hamming distance. Large-scale research and commercial applications of these computations are developing rapidly across artificial intelligence fields as diverse as semantic text querying, retrieval of multimedia materials, and prediction of the properties of pharmacological molecules and engineered materials. While vector similarity searching is, at present, predominantly implemented on standard central processing unit (CPU) hardware running optimized indexing algorithms, the interest in massively-parallel computing architectures is increasing. Accordingly, a range of systems based on graphics processing units (GPU) and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) have been proposed; however, the availability of the design materials for these systems remains largely confined to a small number of corporations and research institutions. Here, we introduce a fully open-source hardware accelerator for vector similarity searching, based on an array of 21 FPGAs densely intertwined with 42 GB of high-speed dynamic memory and installed on a custom-designed compute node board, which yields an aggregate bandwidth of 33.6 GB/s and can be seamlessly reconfigured to implement nearly arbitrary distance calculations. A novel logic and software architecture, based on a lane-wise organization of independent engines implementing distributed distance calculation and sorting, allows attaining noteworthy query latency and power consumption performance on both single- and multi-node system configurations. The entire circuit board hardware, FPGA logic, and host software design is herein presented and freely provided for unlimited use, supporting open innovation and research in this area.

This handheld system includes a Raspberry Pi board, a touch screen display, a customized optical lens group, a ring LED light, and a Li-battery. Based on the open hardware platform and Linux operating system, we have integrated the portable system with component switching and image processing functions. Wide FOV has been realized using image stitching and structure from motion algorithms. This customized low-cost handheld fundus camera provides better image quality than cellphone-based fundus imaging solutions and offers more operational features than traditional portable fundus cameras. It may benefit field portable ophthalmic diagnostic applications.

By making time resolved measurements (up to 0.15 s/cycle) the signal quality has been greatly improved up to an order of magnitude, enabling us to compare our measurements with commercial vibrating sample magnetometers. We also present an additional setup to amplify the Kerr signal in a 25:1 scale, cleaning a large part of the electronic and trigger noise.

TI Design and Building of an Automatic Alternator Synchronizer Based on

AB In power generation systems the synchronization of an alternator with the electrical network are an important and critical task. This paper presents the design and building of an automatic three-phase alternator synchronizer based on a low-cost open-hardware Arduino platform. The synchronization is performed by means of measuring a phase voltage of both the synchronous generator and the electrical grid; then the measured voltages are conditioned and sent to the Arduino board, which is programmed to determine the correct moment to connect the alternator to the grid. To validate the prototype, a laboratory setup has been built with the alternator driven by a commercial dc drive. The design and practical implementation of the system is proposed as a project-based learning (PBL) activity for undergraduate final year students at the University of Bio-Bio, Chile. A description of the constructed prototype and the results obtained are presented and discussed.

   Environments
AB The use of unmanned aquatic surface vehicles as a tool for exploring and inspecting bodies of water, such as lakes and ponds is a research area of growing interest. However, using real aquatic vehicles to test and develop software and control systems is often not feasible for many researchers, due to the limited access to testing pools and the lack of availability of low-cost, off-the-shelf surface vehicles. An alternative is to utilise software simulations, but these can fail to test important system features, such as error characteristics of real sensors, on-board processing and the effect of external disturbances on the performance of positional control systems. The contribution of the present paper is a third method that allows the robot's full software system including real world sensors to be tested without the need for pool facilities. This is achieved by mapping the physics of an omnidirectional aquatic surface robot onto an omnidirectional ground vehicle. A dynamic model of the aquatic surface vehicle is deployed within an embedded control system on the ground vehicle, meaning that for a given command signal ( applied force) the motion of the ground vehicle mimics the motion that would occur if it were a surface vehicle floating on a body of water. Validation tests demonstrate that the ground vehicle's dynamic behaviour matches well with that of a specific aquatic surface vehicle that was utilised in this study. However, by changing the dynamic model within the embedded control system, the ground vehicle is able to approximate the motion of any aquatic surface vehicle. The newly constructed ground robot is now an open-source and open-hardware platform.

AB Robotic-assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) is adopted more and more as it overcomes the shortcomings of classic MIS for surgeons while keeping the benefits of small incisions for patients. However, introducing new technology oftentimes affects the work of skilled practitioners. Our goals are to investigate the impacts of telemanipulated surgical robots on the work practices of surgical teams and to understand their cause. We conducted a field study observing 21 surgeries, conducting 12 interviews and performing 3 data validation sessions with surgeons. Using Thematic Analysis, we find that physically separating surgeons from their teams makes them more autonomous, shifts their use of perceptual senses, and turns the surgeon's assistant into the robot's assistant. We open design opportunities for the HCI field by questioning the telemanipulated approach and discussing alternatives that keep surgeons on the surgical field.

AB Computer vision and pattern recognition are increasingly being employed by smartphone and tablet applications targeted at lay-users. An open design challenge is to make such systems intelligible without requiring users to become technical experts. This paper reports a lab study examining the role of visual feedback. Our findings indicate that the stage of processing from which feedback is derived plays an important role in users' ability to develop coherent and correct understandings of a system's operation. Participants in our study showed a tendency to misunderstand the meaning being conveyed by the feedback, relating it to processing outcomes and higher level concepts, when in reality the feedback represented low level features. Drawing on the experimental results and the qualitative data collected, we discuss the challenges of designing interactions around pattern matching algorithms.

ID DIVISION
AB This paper proposes open-source hardware Posit Arithmetic Core Generator (PACoGen) for the recently developed universal number posit number system, along with a set of pipelined architectures. The posit number system composed of a run-time varying exponent component, which is defined by a composition of varying length "regime-bit" and "exponent-bit" (with a maximum size of ES bits, the exponent size). This in effect also makes the fraction part to vary at run-time in size and position. These run-time variations inherit an interesting hardware design challenge for posit arithmetic architectures. The posit number system, being at an infant stage of its development, possess very limited hardware solutions for its arithmetic architectures. In this view, this paper targets the algorithmic development and generic HDL generators (PACoGen) for basic posit arithmetic. The proposed open source PACoGen currently includes the adder/subtractor, multiplier, and division arithmetic. The PACoGen can provide the Verilog HDL code respective posit arithmetic for any given posit word width (N) and exponent size (ES), as defined under the posit number system. Further, pipelined architectures of 32-bit posit with 6-bit exponent size are also proposed and discussed for addition/subtraction, multiplication, and division arithmetic. The proposed posit arithmetic architectures are demonstrated on the Virtex-7 (xc7vx330t-3ffg1157) FPGA device as well as Nangate 15 nm ASIC platform. The PACoGen would open a gateway for further posit arithmetic hardware exploration and evaluation.

AB Cosmic rays represent not only a significant health risk to the crew of spacecraft and aircraft but also a fundamental phenomenon of basic research on the origin and composition of the universe. High-energy atmospheric physics is a newly opened research domain which focuses on research of terrestrial gamma-ray flashes that can measurably contribute to the aircraft-crew irradiation according to the preliminary computer simulations. High-mountain observatories are suitable places for both the continual monitoring of cosmic radiation and the detection of ionizing radiation generated by lightning. Liulin Mobile Dosimetry Unit (MDU) is a silicon diode based radiation dosimeter developed by the team of Tsvetan Dachev at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, initially for the MIR space station. It is widely used as an instrument for radiation monitoring on board aircraft, on high altitude observatories as well as for example for ion fragmentation studies. The AIRDOS dosimeter is an open source device for measurement in low intensity mixed ionising radiation fields. In its aircraft version, it houses silicon PIN diode as a radiation detector, an electronics for conversion of the signal to the pulse-height spectra, Global Positioning System (GPS) module, memory card and batteries for one-month monitoring. The hardware design of AIRDOS is built on the Open hardware modular platform MLAB. the firmware is written in Open Software platform Processing. Full documentation is freely available. Two AIRDOS devices have been installed at Basic Enviromental Observtory (BEO) Moussala in December 2017, complementing the radiation and environment monitoring instruments already available, including the Liulin MDU. Preliminary results of comparative measurements of radiation environment at BEO Moussala using the AIRDOS units and Liulin MDU will be presented. The results from BEO Moussala will be compared with data acquired on hoard aircraft.

AB Some people with severe disabilities are confined in a state in which communication is virtually impossible, being reduced to communicating with their eyes or using sophisticated systems that translate thoughts into words. The EyeTrackers and Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are suitable systems for those people but their main drawback is their cost. More affordable devices are capable of detecting voluntary blinks and translating them into a binary signal that allows the selection, for example, of an ideogram on a communication board. We tested four different systems based on infrared, bioelectrical signals (Electro-Oculography (EOG) and Electro-Encephalography (EEG)), and video processing. The experiments were performed by people with/without disabilities and analyzed the systems' performances, usability, and method of voluntary blinking (long blinks or sequence of two short blinks). The best accuracy (99.3%) was obtained using Infrared-Oculography (IR-OG) and the worst with the EEG headset (85.9%) and there was a statistical influence of the technology on accuracy. Regarding the method of voluntary blinking, the use of long or double blinks had no statistical influence on accuracy, excluding EOG, and the time taken to perform double blinks was shorter, resulting in a potentially much faster interface. People with disabilities obtained similar values but with greater variability. The preferred technology and blinking methods were Video-Oculography (VOG) and long blinks, respectively. The several Open-Source Hardware (MEW) devices have been developed and a new algorithm for detecting voluntary blinks has also been proposed, which outperforms most of the published papers in the reviewed literature.

AB The advent of mobile and wearable computing technology has opened up tremendous opportunities for health and wellness applications. It is increasingly possible for individuals to wear devices that can sense their physiology or health-related behaviors, collecting valuable data in support of diagnosis, treatment, public health, or other applications. From a researcher's point of view, the commercial availability of these "mHealth" devices has made it feasible to conduct scientific studies of health conditions and to explore health-related interventions. It remains difficult, however, to conduct systems work or other experimental research involving the hardware, software, security, and networking aspects of mobile and wearable technology. In this paper we describe the Amulet platform, an open-hardware, open-software wrist-worn computing device designed specifically for mHealth applications. Our position is that the Amulet is an inexpensive platform for research and education, and we encourage the mHealth community to explore its potential.

AB Internet of Things devices have spread to near ubiquity this decade. All around us now lies an invisible mesh of communication from devices embedded in seemingly everything. Inevitably some of that communication flying around our heads will contain data that must be protected or otherwise shielded from tampering. The responsibility to protect this sensitive information from malicious actors as it travels through the air then falls upon the standards used to communicate this data. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is one of these standards, the aim of this paper is to put its security standards to test. By attempting to exploit its vulnerabilities we can see how secure this standard really is. In this paper, we present steps for analyzing the security of BLE devices using open-source hardware and software.

AB This paper presents a scalable image/video processing platform on Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), capable of capturing images via a low-cost OV7670 camera and in real time displaying the original, in-process, and final results of images on a VGA-interfaced monitor. To make the platform expandable and reusable, not only is the design with Verilog hardware description language (HDL) offered, but also the verification environment including six open verification components (OVCs) is provided. To the best of our knowledge, this proposed work costs the least FPGA resource (753 LUTs and 277 Register) compared to the existing open source implementations on the design of the Camera-FPGA-VGA data path.
   We make this platform publicly available to encourage future research projects on image/video processing, computer vision, machine learning, etc., and to serve educational studies on digital system design with Verilog HDL and FPGAs.

AB Microplate (i.e. microwell plate) is a flat plate that has a specific number of wells to be used as small test tubes in cell-culture studies. In most of the low-budget mammalian cell study laboratories, highly skilled laboratory personnel should determine microscopic changes in microplate well media by taking the microplate outside the incubator and by imaging each well medium under a microscope, with the risk of contamination and reliability degrading. An alternative solution is to use an in-incubator operated live-cell imaging device, which, however, cannot be afforded by low-cost laboratories. In this paper, we present the design, realization, and test stages of a microplate compatible inverted bright-field microscope system that can be used in incubators. The developed system enables real-time and long-term in-incubator imaging of any user-selectable microplate type. The device can capture bright-field microscopic images by using a low-cost CMOS image sensor, an inverted varifocal CCTV lens and an array of light emitting diodes. In addition, by developed two-axial movement stage and image augmenting algorithms, the whole area of a user selectable well (e.g. area of a 6.5 mm diameter well in a 96-well plate) can be automatically imaged without using any other third party software. The long-term performance of the system is tested in incubators with human embryonic kidney and breast cancer cell lines.

AB In the product design, understanding consumer requirements (CRs) is essential due to the fact that it influences the success of the product. Currently, it has been recognized that consumer involvement in an open design (OD) environment is an effective way to reduce the gap between what is required by consumers and what companies can provide. In the process of OD, the initial CRs may shift as the consumers can influence each other, and it is a challenge to capture and evaluate dynamic CRs in OD. In this study, the dynamic relationship between consumers who participate in OD is discussed based on Nash equilibrium. Corresponding to the dynamic relationship, a novel approach is proposed to explore the crucial CRs from consumers' perspective. Initially, the platform of OD is constructed on the Internet to collect the CRs and its evaluations. Thereafter, a similarity-based filtering method (SFM) is presented to filter out the most differentiated evaluations. Furthermore, to get the weight of the CR evaluated by consumers, an improved fuzzy Delphi method is introduced. Meanwhile, to solve the problem of excessive number of CRs, a dual-index evaluation method is put forward to control the opening degree of OD. Finally, to demonstrate the applicability of the suggested approach, a product of smartphone is examined as a case study. The results confirm that the proposed approach is appropriate for capturing and evaluating dynamic CRs in OD.

AB Cars for disabled drivers consist of adapting their functionalities to be operated by hands, in a manner a paraplegic individual should rely only on their hands. This task can become difficult taking into account that the subject must control all functionalities with the same limb. It can increase the risk of car accident. To reduce this type of distraction, we propose the construction of a prototype to control the functionalities in a car using gestures captured by electromyographic signals. The data is simulated by an Arduino and, afterwards, sent to a Raspberry Pi. Then we perform signal classification using an Extreme Learning Machine. The result of the classification will be used to control automotive functionalities. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of real-time car functionalities control using electromyography and efficient low-cost hardware. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose/Background Newer-generation antidepressants used in monotherapy or in combination with other newer-generation antidepressants or other psychotropic drugs are usually preferred as first- or second-step treatment options in resistant depression. According to our clinical experience, tricyclic antidepressants still are one of our preferred first choices in treatment-resistant moderate to severe unipolar major depressive episodes. Methods This 10-week open-design randomized study assessed the effectiveness of switching to imipramine (adjusted to plasma levels) compared with add-on mirtazapine (30 mg/d) for treatment of moderate to severe unipolar major depressive episodes after a 10-week unsuccessful venlafaxine regimen (225-300 mg/d). Efficacy analyses examined the change in depressive symptoms severity from baseline visit to endpoint and the comparative remission rate between treatment subgroups. Findings/Results The randomized sample consisted of 112 venlafaxine-resistant moderate to severe unipolar major depressed patients. Both the percentage of remitters (71.43% vs 39.28%) and the mean reduction of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score (76.94% vs 50.72%) were significantly larger in the imipramine subgroup. Implications/Conclusions Even though we should be cautious about generalizing these results to patients with a less severe unipolar major episodes, our study suggest that switching to imipramine is a very effective treatment option in unipolar major depressive episodes after an unsuccessful venlafaxine regimen.

AB Open source paradigm is becoming widely accepted in scientific communities and open source hardware is finding its steady place in chemistry research. In this review article, we provide the reader with the most up-to-date information on open source hardware and software resources enabling the construction and utilization of an "open source capillary electrophoresis instrument". While CE is still underused as a separation technique, it offers unique flexibility, low-cost, and high efficiency and is particularly suitable for open source instrumental development. We overview the major parts of CE instruments, such as high voltage power supplies, detectors, data acquisition systems, and CE software resources with emphasis on availability of the open source information on the web and in the scientific literature. This review is the first of its kind, revealing accessible blueprints of most parts from which a fully functional open source CE system can be built. By collecting the extensive information on open source capillary electrophoresis in this review article, the authors aim at facilitating the dissemination of knowledge on CE within and outside the scientific community, fosters innovation and inspire other researchers to improve the shared CE blueprints.

AB The use of open software and hardware in STEM education is advantageous due to cost effectiveness and ready availability of design and implementation information. This project, performed as part of the NJ Governor's STEM research competition, involved reverse engineering of a blood glucose analysis meter along with augmentation of features implemented in custom software. An app was created in order to access carbohydrate intake based on dietary consumption, which would then be compared to a diabetic's daily glucose level readings. Projections of biometric trends, along with identification of foods that are helpful or to avoid, can provide important feedback to the user about their personal choices. Pharmaceutical companies are increasingly limiting access to this data, so the open model is encouraged as it provides more customization and greater understanding to the user.
   This project can be implemented over the course of a school semester, with one or more teams of 4-6 high school or early college students working in an engineering laboratory setting. The cost of parts is under $50.00, plus a programmable microcontroller. Skills learned include: circuit reading, circuit design, parts ordering, breadboarding, soldering, database construction and management, programming language learning, microcontroller integration, and software and application design and programming. The set of tasks can be divided up among the students, but results should be shared during final implementation in order that all can benefit from what was accomplished.

AB At present, various existing IoT (Internet of Things, IoT) comprehensive experimental platforms customized experimental toolboxes for specific goals. Therefore, they lack flexibility and scalability and applications are difficult to integrate with each other, which cannot meet the needs of new IoT application development. In response to this problem, this paper proposes an IoT comprehensive experiment and application development platform based on open source ecosystem, which provides support for IoT research, application development and teaching. Compared with traditional platforms, this platform has the end-to-end capabilities of the IoT architecture which is from device layer, transport layer to data processing and application development layer. This comprehensive experimental platform based on open source hardware and IoT middleware provides access for multiple heterogeneous devices and provides a semi-automated physical entity and virtual resource mapping framework. The publish/subscribe model is used for providing data publishing and device management function and loosely coupled integration with multiple cloud platforms. This kind of IoT platform based on open source ecosystem reduces system development cost, improves system flexibility, and meets the diverse needs of practical experimental teaching.

ID PUPIL DETECTION
AB A key assumption conventionally made by flexible head-mounted eye-tracking systems is often invalid: The eye center does not remain stationary w.r.t. the eye camera due to slippage. For instance, eye-tracker slippage might happen due to head acceleration or explicit adjustments by the user. As a result, gaze estimation accuracy can be significantly reduced. In this work, we propose Grip, a novel gaze estimation method capable of instantaneously compensating for eye-tracker slippage without additional hardware requirements such as glints or stereo eye camera setups. Grip was evaluated using previously collected data from a large scale unconstrained pervasive eye-tracking study. Our results indicate significant slippage compensation potential, decreasing average participant median angular offset by more than 43% w.r.t. a non-slippage-robust gaze estimation method. A reference implementation of Grip was integrated into EyeRecToo, an open-source hardware-agnostic eye-tracking software, thus making it readily accessible for multiple eye trackers (Available at: www.ti.uni-tuebingen.de/perception).

AB Traffic management and car parking on modern cities continues to be a problem both for citizens and for city officials. The increasing number of vehicles flowing into the city drain the existing scarce parking resources, and the increase in time spent looking for a parking spot leads to more congestions, parasitic traffic, whilst augmenting fuel consumption and air pollution. In this paper we present an integrated flexible solution developed to help address this issue, using open hardware and software components to develop a low-cost smart parking system suitable for contemporary metropolitan cities. The smart parking solution is based on Arduino boards for the sensors network and on Raspberry Pi single-board computers for the gateway devices, integrated through specific developed software components and a mobile application for the end-users.

AB This article examines how decisions are made and justified within cultures of contribution using an "operational pragmatics." Peer-production and contribution cultures are enfolded in a dynamic of resistance and appropriation in relation to capitalism. Open-source and contribution-based cultural processes have been critiqued as tending towards bureaucracy or becoming enfolded in a never-ending neoliberal imaginary from which escape or transcendence become impossible. An examination of the values expressed within a peer-production community challenges these perspectives and shows how "operational pragmatics" can provide moral justifications through reference to matters of principle and matters of design. Conflating these matters complicates claims about the inherent virtues of participation, especially in technical cultures. A qualitative analysis of an open-source hardware project shows how competing moral justifications unfold, and how the challenges that they pose to capitalism may be tenuous or temporary because of the way that justificatory regimes work within technology development under capitalism.

It focuses on commons-based networks of organisations, technologies and users that form a niche practice on the margins of the dominant paradigm. This practice can be understood as "Design Global, Manufacture Local" and is exemplified by the Hexayurt, the Open Source Ecology Microhouse and the WikiHouse. Using these descriptive case studies, light is shed on the challenges and opportunities of open construction systems with regard to technological, institutional and social perspectives. Notwithstanding the positive dynamics, certain issues need to be addressed, so that a sustainable built environment could flourish.

AB Agricultural research involves study of the complex soil-plant-atmosphere-water system, and data relating to this system must be collected under often-harsh outdoor conditions in agricultural environments. Rapid advancements in electronic technologies in the last few decades, as well as more recent widespread proliferation and adoption of electronic sensing and communications, have created many options to address the needs of professional, as well as amateur, researchers. In this study, an agricultural research project was undertaken to collect data and examine the effects of different agronomic practices on yield, with the objectives being to develop a monitoring system to measure soil moisture and temperature conditions in field plots and to upload the data to an internet website. The developed system included sensor nodes consisting of sensors and electronic circuitry to read and transmit sensor data via radio and a cellular gateway to receive node data and forward the data to an internet website via cellular infrastructure. Microcontroller programs were written to control the nodes and gateway, and an internet website was configured to receive and display sensor data. The battery-powered sensor nodes cost $170 each, including electronic circuitry and sensors, and they were operated throughout the cropping season with little maintenance on a single set of batteries. The solar-powered gateway cost $163 to fabricate, plus an additional cost of $2 per month for cellular network access. Wireless and cellular data transmissions were reliable, successfully transferring 95% of sensor data to the internet website. Application of open-source hardware, wireless data transfer, and internet-based data access therefore offers many options and advantages for agricultural sensing and monitoring efforts.

AB The last decade has witnessed a significant reduction in prices and an increased performance of electronic components, coupled with the influence of the shift towards the generation of open resources, both in terms of knowledge (open access), programs (open-source software), and components (open hardware). This situation has produced different effects in today's society, among which is the empowerment of citizens, called makers, who are themselves able to generate citizen science or build assembly developments. Situated in the context described above, the current study follows a Do-It-Yourself (DIY) approach. In this way, it attempts to define a conceptual design of an Internet of Things (IoT) node, which is reproducible at both physical and behavioral levels, to build IoT nodes which can cover any scenario. To test this conceptual design, this study proposes a sensorization node to monitor meteorological phenomena. The node is called SEnviro (node) and features different improvements such as: the possibility of remote updates using Over-the-Air (OTA) updates; autonomy, using 3G connectivity, a solar panel, and applied energy strategies to prolong its life; and replicability, because it is made up of open hardware and other elements such as 3D-printed pieces. The node is validated in the field of smart agriculture, with the aim of monitoring different meteorological phenomena, which will be used as input to disease detection models to detect possible diseases within vineyards.

AB In general, warehouses are used to store goods or products. In the Warehouses, if the user wants to locate any product it is very difficult, because user have to do a detailed search manually in all the available stockrooms this requires a lot of effort. So to avoid this problem the warehouse inventory management system is very helpful because it maintains the detailed product information and tells us in which stockroom the product is present. The warehouse inventory management system is playing a significant aspect in many productions and goods based methodology. Though there are many wireless communication technologies the RFID suits the best for the warehouse inventory management system. The tag information is transferred from the transmitter section to open source hardware via a wireless link with the aid of internet. The warehouse inventory management system built on the architecture of the Internet of Things is developed to track the products attached to the tags with product information and their respective time stamps for further verification. The Raspberry Pi acts as a central server, monitoring all the information. The total system gives an archetype to correspond the information flow and material flow. The web page which is built in accordance to provide convenient and an interface to the user to track the products. The developed system results a very low cost system and works dynamically compared with the existing present warehouse inventory management systems.

AB Simple 3-D printable open source hardware designs have proven to be effective scientific instruments at low costs. Further development in this area is coupling open source electronics with 3-D printable mechanical components to make fully functional distributedly-manufactured mechatronic tools for science. One research area where such low-cost technology is needed is to characterize thin film anti-reflective coatings and transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) for the glass, mirror and solar photovoltaic industry whose transmission properties are angle dependent. To meet this research need a low-cost 3-D printable open source dual axis gimbal system is presented in this study. An Arduino based microcontroller is used to move the sample holder to the user specified angle where two stepper motors control the motion providing two degrees of freedom. The sample holder is made in such a way that samples can easily be mounted on it by two movable latches. The system was validated and characterized for: i) unidirectional accuracy, ii) repeatability, iii) backlash, iv) speed resolution and v) microstep size. Finally, the mechatronic system is tested for the intended application using a halogen light source and a spectrometer to measure transmission through glass TCO samples through a hemisphere. The system performed as expected has a unidirectional accuracy of 2.827 degrees, repeatability of 1.585 degrees, backlash error of 1.237 degrees, maximum speed of 35.156 degrees and a verifiable microstep size of 0.33 degrees. Despite the highest mean squared errors, the open source gimbal system performed adequately while measuring transmission of radiation through glass with TCO coatings. This open source system also represents a 96% cost in savings as compared to the least expensive commercial variant. The high mean squared errors are offset by the cost of the system coupled with its open source nature that promotes further collaboration and hence, development.

AB This work describes the development of a peristaltic pump and a photometric detector, using "Arduino" and alternative and low-cost materials for flow analysis system. The analytical calibration curve of the acid-red-283 using the proposed system presents 0.9984 and 3.9% as the coefficients of determination and variation, and 1.1 and 3.8 mg L-1 as limits of detection and quantification, respectively. Three prepared samples of the acid-red-283 (25, 30 and 35 mg L-1) showed recovery between 99 to 104%. For construction of the peristaltic pump and the photometer using Light Emitting Diodes (LED), light-dependent resistor (LDR) were spent less than 10% of the cost was spent on a commercial system employing a peristaltic pump and a spectrophotometer. Furthermore, the peristaltic pump and the photometer developed in this work allow the implementation of practical disciplines, such as molecular absorption spectrophotometry and flow analysis system in undergraduate courses, making these instruments more accessible, especially for the chemistry students.

AB Open Source Hardware (OSH) is an increasingly viable approach to intellectual property management extending the principles of Open Source Software (OSS) to the domain of physical products. These principles support the development of products in transparent processes allowing the participation of any interested person. While increasing numbers of products have been released as OSH, little is known on the prevalence of participative development practices in this emerging field. It remains unclear to which extent the transparent and participatory processes known from software reached hardware product development. To fill this gap, this paper applies repository mining techniques to investigate the transparency and workload distribution of 105 OSH product development projects. The results highlight a certain heterogeneity of practices filling a continuum between public and private development settings. They reveal different organizational patterns with different levels of centralization and distribution. Nonetheless, they clearly indicate the expansion of the open source development model from software into the realms of physical products and provide the first large-scale empirical evidence of this recent evolution. Therewith, this article gives body to an emerging phenomenon and contributes to give it a place in the scientific debate. It delivers categories to delineate practices, techniques to investigate them in further detail as well as a large dataset of exemplary OSH projects. The discussion of first results signposts avenues for a stream of research aiming at understanding stakeholder interactions at work in new product innovation practices in order to enable institutions and industry in providing appropriate responses.

DT Article
AB The ability to measure partial pressures of oxygen below 100 microbars and nanomolar dissolved oxygen concentrations in in situ laboratory systems benefits many fields including microbiology, geobiology, oceanography, chemistry, and materials science. Here, we present an easily constructible open-source design for a networked luminescence lifetime measurement system for in situ measurements in arbitrary laboratory containers. The system is well suited for measuring oxygen partial pressures in the 0-100 mu bar range, with the maximum potentially usable upper range limit at around 10 mbar, depending on experimental conditions. The sensor has a limited drift and its detectability limit for oxygen is at 0.02 mu bar for short timescale measurements. Each sensor can connect to a Wi-Fi network and send the logged data either over the Internet or to a local server, enabling a large number of parallel unattended experiments. Designs are also provided for attaching the sensor to various commercially available containers used in laboratories. The design files are released under an open source license, which enables other laboratories to build, customize, and use these sensors.

AB Current high-performance-thin-layer-chromatography instrumentation is offline and stepwise automated. However, moderate miniaturization offers many advantages and together with the transfer of modern print and media technologies to the field of chromatography (office chromatography) it opens up new avenues. This is demonstrated in an allin-one open-source system developed for planar chromatography and especially for ultrathin-layer chromatography. Using an InkShield board to control a thermal inkjet cartridge, picoliter drops were printed at a resolution of 96 dpi on the adsorbent layer. Using Marlin, a popular firmware in 3D printing, Cartesian movement of the print head was made possible for full control of the printing process. Open-source software was developed to control the device in each operation step. Sample solutions and mobile phase were inkjet-printed, exemplarily shown for the analysis of dye- or paraben-mixture solutions. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were investigated for documentation. For example, deep UV LEDs gave access to 254 nm light, and RGB LEDs gave access to the visible-light range. Calibration functions with correlation coefficients superior to 0.999 were obtained by videodensitometry. The developed modular open-source hardware was compact (26 X 31 X 26 cm(3)), light (<3 kg), and affordable ((sic)810). For the given analyses, the footprint of current instrumentation needed was miniaturized by a factor of 9. The highly reduced material design complies with green chemistry and lean laboratory. The design and instruction to reproduce the all-in-one open-source system were made freely available at https://github.com/OfficeChromatography. It is intended to boost progress and understanding by the nature of do it yourself.

ID STATIONARY
AB The solar energy conversion into electricity is a very promising technique, knowing that the source is free, clean and abundant in several countries. However, the effect of the solar cells temperature on the photovoltaic panel performance and lifespan remains one of the major disadvantages of this technology. In this work, we present an experimental study of a particular photovoltaic panel. It is self-cooled due to its open design which facilitates natural ventilation helping to improve its performance mainly in hot hours of the day and to avoid dust accumulation on its surface. This solar system is tested for two soil natures, white and gray, and for two inclination angles, 0 degrees and 30 degrees. Results show that the photovoltaic panel performs better when it is inclined and placed on a white soil. A 3D CFD model describing the performance of this solar system is then developed and a good agreement between the numerical results and experimental data is found. Similarly, this CFD model was used to compare the thermal performance of this solar system to that of the flat PV system and to show that its lower temperature allows better electrical production.

AB Impedance cardiography (ICG) is a noninvasive method for monitoring cardiac dynamics using electrical bioimpedance (EBI) measurements. Since its appearance more than 40 years ago, ICG has been used for assessing hemodynamic parameters. This paper presents a measurement system based on two System on Chip (SoC) solutions and Raspberry PI, implementing both a full three-lead ECG recorder and an impedance cardiographer, for educational and research development purposes. Raspberry PI is a platform supporting Do-I t-Yourself project and education applications across the world. The development is part of Biosignal PI, an open hardware platform focusing in quick prototyping of physiological measurement instrumentation. The SoC used for sensing cardiac biopotential is the ADAS1000, and for the EBI measurement is the AD5933. The recordings were wirelessly transmitted through Bluetooth to a PC, where the waveforms were displayed, and hemodynamic parameters such as heart rate, stroke volume, ejection time and cardiac output were extracted from the ICG and ECG recordings. These results show how Raspberry PI can be used for quick prototyping using relatively widely available and affordable components, for supporting developers in research and engineering education. The design and development documents will be available on www.BiosignalPl.com, for open access under a Non Commercial-Share A like 4.0 International License.

AB Background: Guided implant surgery appears to have several benefits, such as the possibility of inserting flapless implants in a prosthetically driven manner, avoiding dangerous anatomical structures. However, to date, only a few surgeons routinely use guided surgery in partially edentulous patients. Aim: To present the results obtained with tooth-supported surgical templates characterized by an innovative open design with selective support, and manufactured via a full in-office procedure with a low-cost desktop 3D printer. Methods: Over a two-year period (2016-2018), all partially edentulous patients with one to three missing teeth (in maxilla and/or mandible), referred to a private dental practice for restoration with dental implants, were considered for inclusion in this prospective clinical study. An intraoral scanner (CS 3600 (R), Carestream Dental) and cone beam computed tomography (CS 9300 (R), Carestream Dental) were used to acquire the 3D information on the patients. Guided surgery software (SMOP (R), Swissmeda) was used to plan the surgeries and to design open, selective, tooth-supported templates that were fabricated with a stereolithographic (SLA) desktop 3D printer (XFAB2000 (R), DWS). Guided implant surgeries were performed and patients were followed for a period of one year. The study outcomes were fit and stability of surgical templates, duration (time) of surgery, intra and post-operative complications, and implant stability and survival. Results: Twenty (20) partially edentulous patients (9 males, 11 females; mean age 54.4 +/- 9.4 years) were included in the study; 28 open, selective, tooth-supported templates were designed with the aim of inserting 38 implants. Among the surgical templates, 24 had optimal fit and stability, three had optimal fit and sufficient stability, and only one had inadequate fit and unsatisfactory stability and was therefore not suitable for clinical use. The average time of the intervention was 15.7 +/- 5.2 min per template. No intra-operative complications were reported, but one implant was not stable at placement and had to be removed. In total, 36 implants were restored with 10 two-unit fixed partial prostheses and 16 single crowns. All implants were successfully functioning at one year, even if, in two single crowns, minor prosthetic complications (abutment screw loosening) occurred. Conclusions: Full in-office guided surgery with open, selective, tooth-supported templates seem to represent a clinically predictable surgical procedure to restore partially edentulous patients. Further studies are needed to confirm these positive outcomes.

AB Road traffic and its impacts affect various aspects of wellbeing with safety, congestion and pollution being of significant concern in cities. Although there have been a large number of works done in the field of traffic data collection, there are several barriers which restrict the collection of traffic data at higher resolution in the cities. Installation and maintenance costs can act as a disincentive to use existing methods (e.g., loop detectors, video analysis) at a large scale and hence limit their deployment to only a few roads of the city. This paper presents an approach for vehicle counting using a low cost, simple and easily installable system. In the proposed system, vehicles (i.e., bicycles, cars, trucks) are counted by means of variations in the WiFi signals. Experiments with the developed hardware in two different scenarios-low traffic (i.e., 400 objects) and heavy traffic roads (i.e., 1000 objects)-demonstrate its ability to detect cars and trucks. The system can be used to provide estimates of vehicle numbers for streets not covered by official traffic monitoring techniques in future smart cities.

AB Despite a growing consensus that 3D printing technology has emerged as a revolutionary driver of innovation in society and has grown exponentially as an innovation ecosystem, our understanding of how the 3D printing ecosystem emerged and has grown is still limited. Based on the case study and the grounded theory approach, we found that four relevant platforms--open-source hardware platforms, online service platforms, free and low-cost 3D design software platforms, and crowdsourcing platforms-nurtured the innovation ecosystem. We also found that complementary relationships among the four platforms accelerated the growth of the ecosystem from the perspective of an increase in the user base, 3D printer sales, 3D design contents, and the emergence of entrepreneurial firms that are developing the platforms. Consequently, we newly suggest "complementary multiplatforms," a platform strategy that develops multiple platforms with complementary relationships for nurturing an innovation ecosystem. Our findings provide important theoretical grounds for the multiplatform strategy with complementary relationships aimed at facilitating the growth of an innovation ecosystem.

AB Purpose: To study the role of temperature in biological systems, diagnostic contrasts and thermal therapies, RF pulses for MR spin excitation can be deliberately used to apply a thermal stimulus. This application requires dedicated transmit/receive (Tx/Rx) switches that support high peak powers for MRI and high average powers for RF heating. To meet this goal, we propose a high-performance Tx/Rx switch based on positive-intrinsic-negative diodes and quarter-wavelength (lambda/4) stubs.
   Methods: The lambda/4 stubs in the proposed Tx/Rx switch design route the transmitted RF signal directly to the RF coil/antenna without passing through any electronic components (e.g., positive-intrinsic-negative diodes). Bench measurements, MRI, MR thermometry, and RF heating experiments were performed at f = 297 MHz (B-0 = 7 T) to examine the characteristics and applicability of the switch.
   Results: The proposed design provided an isolation of -235.7dB/-241.5dB during transmission/reception. The insertion loss was -20.41dB/-20.27dB during transmission/reception. The switch supports high peak (3.9 kW) and high average (120 W) RF powers for MRI and RF heating at f = 297 MHz. High-resolution MRI of the wrist yielded image quality competitive with that obtained with a conventional Tx/Rx switch. Radiofrequency heating in phantom monitored by MR thermometry demonstrated the switch applicability for thermal modulation. Upon these findings, thermally activated release of a model drug attached to thermoresponsive polymers was demonstrated.
   Conclusion: The high-power Tx/Rx switch enables thermal MR applications at 7 T, contributing to the study of the role of temperature in biological systems and diseases. All design files of the switch will be made available open source at www.opensourceimaging.org.

AB Design problems are often presented as structured briefs with detailed constraints and requirements, suggesting a fixed definition. However, past studies have identified the importance of exploring design problems for creative design outcomes. Previous protocol studies of designers has shown that problems can "co-evolve" with the development of solutions during the design process. But to date, little evidence has been provided about how designers systematically explore presented problems to create better solutions. In this study, we conducted a qualitative analysis of 252 design problems collected from publically available sources, including award-winning product designs and open-source design competitions. This database offers an independent sample of presented problems, designers' alternative problem descriptions, and innovative solutions. We report the results of this large-scale qualitative analysis aimed at characterizing changes to problems during the design process. Inductive coding was used to identify content patterns in "discovered" problem descriptions, with qualitative codes reliably scored by two independent coders. A total of 32 distinct patterns of problem exploration were identified across designers and presented problems. Each pattern is described in the form of a generalized strategy to guide designers as they explore problem spaces. The exploration patterns identified in this study are the first empirical evidence of problem exploration in independent design problems. Further, the presence of exploration patterns in discovered problems is associated with the selection of the corresponding solution as a challenge finalist. These empirically identified strategies for problem exploration may be useful for computational tools supporting designers.

AB The use of millirobots, particularly in swarm studies, would enable researchers to verify their proposed autonomous cooperative behavior algorithms under realistic conditions with a large number of agents. While multiple designs for such robots have been proposed, they, typically, require custom-made components, which make replication and manufacturing difficult, and, mostly, employ non-modular integral designs. Furthermore, these robots' proposed small sizes tend to limit sensory perception capabilities and operational time. Some have resolved few of the above issues through the use of extensions that, unfortunately, add to their size.
   In contribution to the pertinent field, thus, a novel millirobot with an open-source design, addressing the above concerns, is presented in this paper. Our proposed millirobot has a modular design and uses easy to source, off-the-shelf components. The milli-robot-Toronto (mROBerTO) also includes a variety of sensors and has a 16 x 16 mm(2) footprint. mROBerTO's wireless communication capabilities include ANT TM, Bluetooth Smart, or both simultaneously. Data-processing is handled by an ARM processor with 256 KB of flash memory. Additionally, the sensing modules allow for extending or changing the robot's perception capabilities without adding to the robot's size. For example, the swarm-sensing module, designed to facilitate swarm studies, allows for measuring proximity and bearing to neighboring robots and performing local communications.
   Extensive experiments, some of which are presented herein, have illustrated the capability of mROBerTO units for use in implementing a variety of commonly proposed swarm algorithms.

AB An important goal of structured parallel programming has been to provide a design framework that balances between the extent of abstraction built over the hardware and the amount of control given to the programmer to leverage the hardware resource features. Towards this goal, NVIDIA has released an open-source design framework called Thrust based on C++ STL, where the developers can express the functionality in STL style, without having to know the architectural details of the underlying parallel infrastructure. While the framework is generic and portable, it does not support the right abstraction for two-dimensional data, which is heavily used in most of the popular parallel algorithms. In this paper, we proposed Thrust2D, an extension of Thrust to support the abstraction for two-dimensional data, targeted towards structured grid class of applications. We took several structured grid examples from Rodinia benchmark, OpenCV framework, and NVIDIA samples and rewrote them using Thrust2D. We demonstrated that, in some cases, we get nearly 80% reduction in code complexity, and for 12 out of 17 applications we have tested, the kernel performance of Thrust2D versions are well within 85% of the native CUDA versions. When we consider the total execution time, 14 out of 17 Thrust2D versions performance are within 85% of the native CUDA versions. In some cases, the performance of the Thrust2D versions has outperformed the native versions.

AB The expected abolishment of SF6-gas in mediumvoltage switchgear has prompted a search for replacements for the switch types that depend on SF6 to obtain the required capability, reliability, compactness, and cost. Ablation of polymers can enhance the arc-quenching capabilities in certain electrical switch designs. Several aspects, like electric arc plasma composition, gas flow, and wall stabilization, must play together to obtain successful interruption. In this paper, open and closed switch geometries and two nozzle materials [polypropylene (PP) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)] are studied in medium-voltage interruption experiments. Fundamental differences in the arc-quenching process for PP and PTFE are shown. In the case of PTFE, the current interruption performance depends on gas flow resulting from the pressure built up under the high-current period. In the case of PP, the gas flow plays a lesser role for the arc-quenching capability as the interruption capability is large even in an open design with no forced gas flow around current zero. Current chopping happens a few tens of microseconds before voltage zero crossing; thereafter, a remnant conductance in the contact gap is observed, lasting for up to several milliseconds. This can be explained by an arc-to-glow transition in the presence of hydrogen.

AB Laboratory automation improves test reproducibility, which is vital to patient care in clinical laboratories. Many small and specialty laboratories are excluded from the benefits of automation due to low sample number, cost, space, and/or lack of automation expertise. The Minimum Viable Option (MVO) automation platform was developed to address these hurdles and fulfill an unmet need. Consumer 3D printing enabled rapid iterative prototyping to allow for a variety of instrumentation and assay setups and procedures. Three MVO versions have been produced. MVOv1.1 successfully performed part of a clinical assay, and results were comparable to those of commercial automation. Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (RPI3) single-board computers with Sense Hardware Attached on Top (HAT) and Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2 hardware were remotely accessed and evaluated for their suitability to qualify the latest MVOv1.2 platform. Sense HAT temperature, barometric pressure, and relative humidity sensors were stable in climate-controlled environments and are useful in identifying appropriate laboratory spaces for automation placement. The RPI3 with camera plus digital dial indicator logged axis travel experiments. RPI3 with camera and Sense HAT as a light source showed promise when used for photometric dispensing tests. Individual well standard curves were necessary for well-to-well light and path length compensations.

AB Critical to maintaining quality control in high-throughput screening is the need for constant monitoring of liquid-dispensing fidelity. Traditional methods involve operator intervention with gravimetric analysis to monitor the gross accuracy of full plate dispenses, visual verification of contents, or dedicated weigh stations on screening platforms that introduce potential bottlenecks and increase the plate-processing cycle time. We present a unique solution using open-source hardware, software, and 3D printing to automate dispenser accuracy determination by providing real-time dispense weight measurements via a network-connected precision balance. This system uses an Arduino microcontroller to connect a precision balance to a local network. By integrating the precision balance as an Internet of Things (IoT) device, it gains the ability to provide real-time gravimetric summaries of dispensing, generate timely alerts when problems are detected, and capture historical dispensing data for future analysis. All collected data can then be accessed via a web interface for reviewing alerts and dispensing information in real time or remotely for timely intervention of dispense errors. The development of this system also leveraged 3D printing to rapidly prototype sensor brackets, mounting solutions, and component enclosures.

ID SUSTAINABILITY
AB The emerging discussion about the sustainability potential of distributed production is the starting point for this paper. The focus is on the "design global, manufacture local" model. This model builds on the conjunction of the digital commons of knowledge and design with desktop and benchtop manufacturing technologies (from three-dimensional printers and laser cutters to low-tech tools and crafts). Two case studies are presented to illustrate three interlocked practices of this model for degrowth. It is argued that a "design global, manufacture local" model, as exemplified by these case studies, seems to arise in a significantly different political economy from that of the conventional industrial model of mass production. "Design global, manufacture local" may be seen as a platform to bridge digital and knowledge commons with existing physical infrastructures and degrowth communities, in order to achieve distributed modes of collaborative production.

AB The current disruptive innovation in civilian drone (UAV) applications has led to an increased need for research and development in UAV technology. The key challenges currently being addressed are related to UAV platform properties such as functionality, reliability, fault tolerance, and endurance, which are all tightly linked to the UAV flight controller hardware and software. The lack of standardization of flight controller architectures and the use of proprietary closed-source flight controllers on many UAV platforms, however, complicates this work: solutions developed for one flight controller may be difficult to port to another without substantial extra development and testing. Using open-source flight controllers mitigates some of these challenges and enables other researchers to validate and build upon existing research.
   This paper presents a survey of the publicly available open-source drone platform elements that can be used for research and development. The survey covers open-source hardware, software, and simulation drone platforms and compares their main features.

AB We present the Kilogrid, an open-source virtualization environment and data logging manager for the Kilobot robot, Kilobot for short. The Kilogrid has been designed to extend the sensory-motor abilities of the Kilobot, to simplify the task of collecting data during experiments, and to provide researchers with a tool to fine-control the experimental setup and its parameters. Based on the design of the Kilobot and compatible with existing hardware, the Kilogrid is a modular system composed of a grid of computing nodes, or modules that provides a bidirectional communication channel between the Kilobots and a remote workstation. In this paper, we describe the hardware and software architecture of the Kilogrid system as well as its functioning to accompany its release as a new open hardware tool for the swarm robotics community. We demonstrate the capabilities of the Kilogrid using a 200-module Kilogrid, swarms of up to 100 Kilobots, and four different case studies: exploration and obstacle avoidance, site selection based on multiple gradients, plant watering, and pheromone-based foraging. Through this set of case studies, we show how the Kilogrid allows the experimenter to virtualize sensors and actuators not available to the Kilobot and to automatize the collection of data essential for the analysis of the experiments.

Our main innovation is in the design of a robust full-body biped humanoid robot equipped with very low-cost polyurethane torsional spring fixed to traditional servo motors and a circuit to measure angular displacement, transforming the system into a series elastic actuator (SEA). In order to illustrate the robot's qualities in the field of machine learning applied to robotics and manipulation, a multiple timescale recurrent neural network (MTRNN) is implemented, allowing the robot to replicate combined movement sequences earlier taught via interactive demonstration.

AB Microcontrollers are programmable, integrated circuit chips. In the last two decades, their applications to industrial instruments, vehicles, and household appliances have reached the extent that microcontrollers are now the number-one selling electronic chip of all kinds. Simultaneously, the field of lab-on-a-chip research and technology has seen major technological leaps towards sample handling, sample preparation, and sensing for use in molecular diagnostic devices. Yet, the transformation from a laboratory based lab-on-a-chip technology to actual point-of-care device products has largely been limited to a fraction of the foreseen potential. We believe that increased knowledge of the vast possibilities that becomes available with open source microcontrollers, especially when embedded in easy-to-use development environments, such as the Arduino or Raspberry Pi, could potentially solve and even bridge the gap between lab-on-a-chip technology and real-life point of care applications. The profuse availability and extraordinary capabilities of microcontrollers, namely within computation, communication, and networking, combined with easy-to-use development environments, as well as a very active and fast moving community of makers, who are eager to share their knowledge, could potentially be the difference between a dreadful chip-in-a-lab-situation, and the next successful start-up. Here follows a brief insight into how open source microcontrollers could potentially have a transformative effect on the field of lab-on-a-chip research and technology. Details in some specific areas of application are briefly treated before addressing challenges and future perspectives.

AB Advances in scientific knowledge are increasingly supported by a growing community of developers freely sharing new hardware and software tools. In this spirit we have developed a free Android app, ABE-VIEW, that provides a flexible graphical user interface (GUI) populated entirely from a remote instrument by ascii-coded instructions communicated wirelessly over Bluetooth. Options include an interactive chart for plotting data in real time, up to 16 data fields, and virtual controls including buttons, numerical controls with user-defined range and resolution, and radio buttons which the user can use to send coded instructions back to the instrument. Data can be recorded into comma delimited files interactively at the user's discretion. Our original objective of the project was to make data acquisition and control for undergraduate engineering labs more modular and affordable, but we have also found that the tool is highly useful for rapidly testing novel sensor systems for iterative improvement. Here we document the operation of the app and syntax for communicating with it. We also illustrate its application in undergraduate engineering labs on dynamic systems modeling, as well as for identifying the source of harmonic distortion affecting electrochemical impedance measurements at certain frequencies in a novel wireless potentiostat.

In-storage anti-virus systems are able to isolate malicious effects from main computing platforms, and they reduce the system overhead for virus detection. We implement our in-storage anti-virus platform using cost-effective, open-source hardware, and we verify that is practically applicable to storage devices.

AB The design and construction of a low-cost and compact USB photometer based on open source hardware and software is described. The device, featuring a 1 ms sample acquisition time, utilizes a single interchangeable light emitting diode (LED) as a light source in combination with photodiode detectors and a Texas Instruments LaunchPad as the main control unit. An appropriately constructed flow cell can be connected to a flow reactor made out of transparent polymeric material such as perfluoroalkoxy (PFA) tubing. The flow cell can be moved to different positions of the tube in order to take measurements at different residence times without having to disassemble the photometer or the flow reactor system. The bespoke photometer was used to determine the residence time distribution (RTD) of various microreactors/micromixers, as well as for measuring the reaction rate constant for the base-induced hydrolysis of p-nitrophenol acetate in a biphasic segmented flow system. Owing to the 1 ms sample acquisition time of the novel device the lengths of individual segments can be measured in real time.

AB Background. A trainer for online laparoscopic surgical skills assessment based on the performance of experts and nonexperts is presented. The system uses computer vision, augmented reality, and artificial intelligence algorithms, implemented into a Raspberry Pi board with Python programming language. Methods. Two training tasks were evaluated by the laparoscopic system: transferring and pattern cutting. Computer vision libraries were used to obtain the number of transferred points and simulated pattern cutting trace by means of tracking of the laparoscopic instrument. An artificial neural network (ANN) was trained to learn from experts and nonexperts' behavior for pattern cutting task, whereas the assessment of transferring task was performed using a preestablished threshold. Four expert surgeons in laparoscopic surgery, from hospital Raymundo Abarca Alarcon, constituted the experienced class for the ANN. Sixteen trainees (10 medical students and 6 residents) without laparoscopic surgical skills and limited experience in minimal invasive techniques from School of Medicine at Universidad Autonoma de Guerrero constituted the nonexperienced class. Data from participants performing 5 daily repetitions for each task during 5 days were used to build the ANN. Results. The participants tend to improve their learning curve and dexterity with this laparoscopic training system. The classifier shows mean accuracy and receiver operating characteristic curve of 90.98% and 0.93, respectively. Moreover, the ANN was able to evaluate the psychomotor skills of users into 2 classes: experienced or nonexperienced. Conclusion. We constructed and evaluated an affordable laparoscopic trainer system using computer vision, augmented reality, and an artificial intelligence algorithm. The proposed trainer has the potential to increase the self-confidence of trainees and to be applied to programs with limited resources.

AB This paper describes the use of an instrumented bicycle and its computational model for teaching multibody dynamics. The presented approach employs the Whipple model for the kinematic and inverse dynamic simulation of a bicycle ride using as an input three generalized coordinates registered with digital sensors. During the experimental phase, students ride the instrumented bicycle to collect the necessary sensor data. The kinematic and inverse dynamic simulations based on these signals provide a full picture of the motion of the system in different positions and at a range of velocities and accelerations. In addition, they estimate the traction, control, and tire-to-road contact forces during the ride. To validate the simulated results, the simulated velocity and accelerations are compared with the data acquired with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) installed on the bicycle. The paper describes the experimental setup of the instrumented bicycle, enabling readers to build the very same system for their own educational use. The instrumented bicycle system is based on open-source software and as much as possible on open hardware.

AB In this paper we demonstrate a potentiostat built with a single commercially available integrated circuit (IC) that does not require any external electronic components to perform electrochemical experiments. This is done using the capabilities of the Programmable System on a Chip (PSoC (R)) by Cypress Semiconductor, which integrates all of the necessary electrical components. This is in contrast to other recent papers that have developed potentiostats but require technical skills or specialized equipment to produce. This eliminates the process of having to make a printed circuit board and soldering on electronic components. To control the device, a graphical user interface (GUI) was developed in the python programming language. Python is open source, with a style that makes it easy to read and write programs, making it an ideal choice for open source projects. As the developed device is open source and based on a PSoC, modification to implement other electrochemical techniques is straightforward and only requires modest programming skills, but no expensive equipment or difficult techniques. The potentiostat developed here adds to the growing amount of open source laboratory equipment. To demonstrate the PSoC potentiostat in a wide range of applications, we performed cyclic voltammetry (to measure vitamin C concentration in orange juice), amperometry (to measure glucose with a glucose strip), and stripping voltammetry experiments (to measure lead in water). The device was able to perform all experiments and could accurately measure Vitamin C, glucose, and lead.

AB In this paper, a general architecture for the implementation of software-defined optoelectronic systems is described. This concept harnesses the flexibility of software-defined hardware to implement optoelectronic systems which can be configured to adapt to multiple high speed optical engineering applications. As an application example, a software-defined optical interferometer using a commercial software-defined radio platform is built. The system is tested by performing high speed optical detection of laser-induced photoacoustic signals in a concentrated dye solution. Using software modifications only, conventional single carrier and also multicarrier heterodyne techniques with space and frequency diversity are performed. The latter technique shows a noticeable performance improvement in single-shot interferometric measurements.

AB Many organizations are resorting to open prize-based challenges and competitions to identify the best possible designs for their future products or services. As an example, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) hosted an open challenge for designing the drivetrain and mobility subsystem of a Fast Adaptable Next-Generation Ground Vehicle (FANG-1) in early 2013. A $1 million prize was awarded to the team with the highest concept score and the design was subsequently physically implemented and tested. The competition was the first attempt by DARPA to utilize crowdsourcing for the design of complex military systems, which is in contrast with contracting directly with a small number of incumbent firms within the defense industry. The competition attracted over 200 participating teams and the winning team was announced in April 2013. In this paper, inspired by the FANG-1 challenge, a generalizable simulation model for predicting the dynamics of open prize-based design challenges and competitions is developed using a combination of several modeling methods. The model is then applied to simulate the dynamics of the FANG-1 challenge ex post facto, including an approximation of the distribution of team scores as well as the interteam motivational interactions. Using the simulation model, various sensitivity analyses were then performed to identify factors that could enhance future design challenges and competitions in terms of resulting innovation and productivity.

AB Many aspects of the fundamental spatiotemporal organization of cells are governed by reaction-diffusion type systems. In vitro reconstitution of such systems allows for detailed studies of their underlying mechanisms which would not be feasible in vivo. Here, we provide a protocol for the in vitro reconstitution of the MinCDE system of Escherichia coli, which positions the cell division septum in the cell middle. The assay is designed to supply only the components necessary for self-organization, namely a membrane, the two proteins MinD and MinE and energy in the form of ATP. We therefore fabricate an open reaction chamber on a coverslip, on which a supported lipid bilayer is formed. The open design of the chamber allows for optimal preparation of the lipid bilayer and controlled manipulation of the bulk content. The two proteins, MinD and MinE, as well as ATP, are then added into the bulk volume above the membrane. Imaging is possible by many optical microscopies, as the design supports confocal, wide-field and TIRF microscopy alike. In a variation of the protocol, the lipid bilayer is formed on a patterned support, on cellshaped PDMS microstructures, instead of glass. Lowering the bulk solution to the rim of these compartments encloses the reaction in a smaller compartment and provides boundaries that allow mimicking of in vivo oscillatory behavior. Taken together, we describe protocols to reconstitute the MinCDE system both with and without spatial confinement, allowing researchers to precisely control all aspects influencing pattern formation, such as concentration ranges and addition of other factors or proteins, and to systematically increase system complexity in a relatively simple experimental setup.

AB Many Internet of Things (IoT) applications are emerging and evolving rapidly thanks to widespread open-source hardware platforms. Most of the high-end open-source IoT platforms include built-in peripherals, such as the universal asynchronous receiver and transmitter (UART), pulse width modulation (PWM), general purpose input output (GPIO) ports and timers, and have enough computation power to run embedded operating systems such as Linux. However, each IoT platform has its own way of configuring peripherals, and it is difficult for programmers or users to configure the same peripheral on a different platform. Although diverse open-source IoT platforms are widespread, the difficulty in programming those platforms hinders the growth of IoT applications. Therefore, we propose an easy and convenient way to program and configure the operation of each peripheral using a user-friendly Web-based software framework. Through the implementation of the software framework and the real mobile robot application development along with it, we show the feasibility of the proposed software framework, named SoEasy.

AB "Smart" water systems are transforming the field of stormwater management by enabling real-time monitoring and control of previously static infrastructure. While the localized benefits of active control are well-established, the potential for system-scale control of watersheds is poorly understood. This study shows how a real-world smart stormwater system can be leveraged to shape streamflow within an urban watershed. Specifically, we coordinate releases from two internet-controlled stormwater basins to achieve desired control objectives downstream such as maintaining the flow at a set-point, and generating interleaved waves. In the first part of the study, we describe the construction of the control network using a low-cost, open-source hardware stack and a cloud-based controller scheduling application. Next, we characterize the system's control capabilities by determining the travel times, decay times, and magnitudes of various waves released from the upstream retention basins. With this characterization in hand, we use the system to generate two desired responses at a critical downstream junction. First, we generate a set-point hydrograph, in which flow is maintained at an approximately constant rate. Next, we generate a series of overlapping and interleaved waves using timed releases from both retention basins. We discuss how these control strategies can be used to stabilize flows, thereby mitigating streambed erosion and reducing contaminant loads into downstream waterbodies.

AB As a result of the globalisation of the semiconductor design and fabrication processes, integrated circuits are becoming increasingly vulnerable to malicious attacks. The most concerning threats are hardware trojans. A hardware trojan is a malicious inclusion or alteration to the existing design of an integrated circuit, with the possible effects ranging from leakage of sensitive information to the complete destruction of the integrated circuit itself. While the majority of existing detection schemes focus on test-time, they all require expensive methodologies to detect hardware trojans. Off-the-shelf approaches have often been overlooked due to limited hardware resources and detection accuracy. With the advances in technologies and the democratisation of open-source hardware, however, these tools enable the detection of hardware trojans at reduced costs during or after production. In this manuscript, a hardware trojan is created and emulated on a consumer FPGA board. The experiments to detect the trojan in a dormant and active state are made using off-the-shelf technologies taking advantage of different techniques such as Power Analysis Reports, Side Channel Analysis and Thermal Measurements. Furthermore, multiple attempts to detect the trojan are demonstrated and benchmarked. Our simulations result in a state-of-the-art methodology to accurately detect the trojan in both dormant and active states using off-the-shelf hardware.

The system comprises a light dependent resistor and infrared temperature sensor interfaced with an ESP-12E microcontroller, a programmable data acquisition platform; together these enable remote real-time monitoring of turbidity data applicable to chemical education. This system will allow educators and students to monitor chemical experiments in real-time through a web browser. Changes in turbidity and signal processing associated with a light dependent resistor are stored locally on the microcontroller and transmitted wirelessly via a WiFi-based connection to a cloud-based server. The light intensity signals are displayed on the system through an organic light-emitting diode and subsequently uploaded to a cloud-based server. A web-based signal processing MATLAB program plots the uploaded signals available as real-time streams to authorized subscribers over standard browsers.

AB This work describes the first imaging studies on a 1.0 Tesla inline MRI-Linac using a dedicated transmit/receive RF body coil that has been designed to be completely radio transparent and provide optimum imaging performance over a large patient opening.
   A series of experiments was performed on the MRI-Linac to investigate the performance and imaging characteristics of a new dedicated volumetric RF coil: (1) numerical electromagnetic simulations were used to measure transmit efficiency in two patient positions; (2) image quality metrics of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), ghosting and uniformity were assessed in a large diameter phantom with no radiation beam; (3) radiation induced effects were investigated in both the raw data (k-space) and image sequences acquired with simultaneous irradiation; (4) radiation dose was measured with and without image acquisition; (5) RF heating was studied using an MR-compatible fluoroptic thermometer and; (6) the in vivo image quality and versatility of the coil was demonstrated in normal healthy subjects for both supine and standing positions.
   Daily phantom measurements demonstrated excellent imaging performance with stable SNR over a period of 3 months (42.6 +/- 0.9). Simultaneous irradiation produced no statistical change in image quality (p > 0.74) and no interference in raw data for a 20 x 20 cm radiation field. The coil was found to be efficient over large volumes and negligible RF heating was observed. Volunteer scans acquired in both supine and standing positions provided artefact free images with good anatomical visualisation.
   The first completely radio transparent RF coil for use on a 1.0 Tesla MRI-Linac has been described. There is no impact on either the imaging or dosimetry performance with a simultaneous radiation beam. The open design enables imaging and radiotherapy guidance in a variety of positons.

AB Artificial vision algorithms are approaching human performance in many respects. However, their computational demands are also growing, which constraints their use in mobile and time-sensitive robots. Biological vision presents a well known practical solution. Specifically, primates limit the computational demands of vision by processing only small parts of the scene in detail, and frequently reorienting the eyes to different locations. Artificial vision is much more power-intensive than biological vision, so this strategy is likely to be increasingly relevant to robots, as they become more visually sophisticated. To facilitate progress and reduce duplication of work in this area, we have developed a 7-degree-of-freedom robotic head that supports such rapid saccade-like camera movements, and we are releasing the design files under an open-hardware license. The system supports C-mount cameras, large foveated lenses, and liquid lenses that allow rapid changes in focus distance. It also has a stereo baseline that is roughly the same as that of humans, to support stereo processing of nearby objects in grasping and manipulation tasks. The main contributions of this work are the mechanical design, and the demonstration that its stereo baseline, range of motion, and saccade velocity are similar to those of primate systems. The main general advantages over existing robotic heads are speed and the open-hardware license. The system would also be an ideal platform for future research that aims to replicate the performance of primate vision systems.

AB Conventional passive air samplers (PAS) and passive dry deposition samplers (PAS-DD) were deployed along a 90 km south-north transect at five sites in the Athabasca oil sands region (AOSR) during October to November 2015. The purpose was to compare and characterize the performance of the two passive sampling methods for targeted compounds across a range of site types. Samples were analyzed for polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs), nitrated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (NPAHs), and oxygenated PAHs (OPAHs). Sigma PAC and Sigma NPAH concentrations were highest in PAS and PAS-DD samplers at site AMS5, which is the closest sampling site to surface mining and upgrading facilities. The OPAHs were elevated at site AMS6, which is located in the town of Fort McMurray, approximately 30 km south of the main mining area. PAS-DD was enriched relative to PAS in particle-associated target chemicals, which is consistent with the relatively more open design of PAS-DD intended to capture particle-phase (and gas-phase) deposition. Petroleum coke (petcoke) (i.e., the carbonaceous byproduct of bitumen upgrading) and oil sands ore (i.e., the material mined in open-pit mines from which bitumen is extracted) were assessed for their potential to be a source of PACs to air in the oil sands region. The ore samples contained similar to 8 times and similar to 40 times higher Sigma PACs concentrations (dry weight basis) than delayed and fluid petcoke, respectively. The residue analysis of ore and petcoke samples also revealed that the chemical 4-nitrobiphenyl (4-NBP) can be used to track gas-phase emissions to air. A comparison of chemical residues in ore, petcoke, and air samples revealed that the ore is likely a major contributor to volatile PACs present in air and that both ore and petcoke are contributing to the particle-associated PACs in air near open-pit mining areas. The contribution of petcoke particles in passive air samples was also confirmed qualitatively using scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS).

AB This paper explores three cases of Do-It-Yourself, open-source technologies developed within the diverse array of topics and themes in the communities around the Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science (Public Lab). These cases focus on aerial mapping, water quality monitoring and civic science practices. The techniques discussed have in common the use of accessible, community-built technologies for acquiring data. They are also concerned with embedding collaborative and open source principles into the objects, tools, social formations and data sharing practices that emerge from these inquiries. The focus is on developing processes of collaborative design and experimentation through material engagement with technology and issues of concern. Problem-solving, here, is a tactic, while the strategy is an ongoing engagement with the problem of participation in its technological, social and political dimensions especially considering the increasing centralization and specialization of scientific and technological expertise. The authors also discuss and reflect on the Public Lab's approach to civic science in light of ideas and practices of citizen/civic veillance, or "sousveillance", by emphasizing people before data, and by investigating the new ways of seeing and doing that this shift in perspective might provide.

SO 3C TECNOLOGIA

DT Article
DE Kinematics; Dynamics; Uncertainty; Open hardware; Measurement
AB The kinematic studies the motion of a particle without considering the effects that produce movement, while the dynamics studies the factors that produce changes in a system. It proposes the establishment of measuring equipment that can record physical parameters focused on the kinematics and dynamics, using the equations deducted from the calculation for the movement, by modifying travel distance, angle of inclination and mass of the objects. The measurement of the time will be used to obtain the uncertainty in the experiments, the dispersion of the available data is related to the size of the sample and the procedure used. In the indirect measurements were used equations due to the correlation in the physical variables for the analysis of uncertainty. One of the methods for uncertainty analysis is based on the statistical analysis, another way to estimate this is through experience or external information available. The experiments made in the inclined plane for the study of the velocity, acceleration and force of friction to angles greater than 15 degrees, showed a relative error of 1.8% in the time variable, the standard uncertainty had a normal distribution with a confidence level of 95%.

DT Article
DE Differential-drive robot; interface; robotics; ROS; swarm; Turtlebot 2;

AB To be able to use robots of the same type in a swarm (in this case differential-drive robots) from a centralized computer, you need to control them in the same way even if the robots come from different manuf acturers. These robots should have the same capabilities: i.e. the same type of sensors and the same type of control commands. Currently, if we need to add sensors on a robot, we should first find out what are the hardware capabilities and what are the tools provided by the manufacturer (some have microcontrollers, others have ARM processors). The protocol to communicate with the onboard card (often a serial protocol) is different for each robot and we have to take that in account in our software so that the robots can be interchangeable.
   This paper describes the design and the results of using a standard interface (bridge) on a robot which allows wireless communication with a centralized computer and local serial communication with a mobile robot. On this interface, we can connect every sensor we want (infrared, ultrasound, laser, Kinect etc.) and we can always use the same tools to control them.
   Extension of the protocol of the Kobuki base (TurtleBot 2) is proposed to be able to use the same type of frame as the TurtleBot 2 uses and to continue to use ROS middleware as is, but with the possibility to use data from new sensors implemented on the bridge. This article will focus on the use of the TurtleBot 2, but the same bridge will be adapted to other robots allowing their interchangeability in the future.

   Medical Devices
AB Objectives: The principal motivation for regulating medical devices is to protect patients and users. Complying with regulations may result in an increase in development, manufacturing and service costs for medical companies and ultimately for healthcare providers and patients, limiting the access to adequate medical equipment. On the other hand, poor regulatory control has resulted in the use of substandard devices. This study aims at comparing the certification route that manufactures have to respect for marketing a medical device in some African Countries and in European Union.
   Methods: We examined and compared the current and future regulations on medical devices in the European Union and in some countries in Africa. Contextually we proposed future approaches to open design strategies supported by emerging technologies as a means to enhance economically sustainable healthcare system driven by innovation.
   Results: African medical device regulations have an affinity to European directives, despite the fact that the latter are particularly strict. Several states have also implemented or harmonized directives to medical device regulation, or have expressed interest in establishing them in their legislation. Open Source Medical Devices hold a great promise to reduce costs but do need a high level of supervision, to control their quality and to guarantee their respect for safety standards.
   Conclusion: Harmonization across the two continents could be leveraged to optimize the costs of device manufacture and sale. Regulated open design strategies can enhance economically sustainable innovation. (C) 2018 Fellowship of Postgraduate Medicine. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Low productivity of microalgal cultures leads to a high cost of the fuel feedstock. Turbidostat operation, which automatically monitors and controls biomass density, is a mean to manage biomass density and internal light intensity, so that biomass productivity can be maximized. Available versions of turbidostat control are expensive and not amenable to large-scale operation. We designed a system that costs less than $250 and that can be used for any type of microbiological system. It includes an in-line, infrared turbidity sensor connected to an Arduino ATmega microcontroller and auxiliary power replays. The target biomass density is adjustable, and key operating data-such as time stamps, pump status, and set and measured values of biomass density-are available in real time and logged continuously. The sensor's output was linear for OD730 from 0.5 to 4.5, which brackets the realistic ranges for microalgae culturing. We tested the turbidostat with step-down and step-up experiments with Synechocystis cultures. The turbidostat maintained stable biomass concentrations for all steps. The results of the turbidostat experiments demonstrated how turbidity control leads to systematic management of average internal light intensity, specific growth rate, and biomass production rate. This open-design, low-cost system should promote higher productivity and help make microalgae biomass an affordable fuel feedstock.

AB Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a very popular tool for diagnostic applications and research studies. Low-field MR scanners, usually with an open design, are suitable for claustrophobic and obese patients, as well as for children, who may be fearful in closed MR scanners. However, these types of scanners provide lower spatial resolution and a lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) if compared with the same examination performed at the same time at high field scanners. It is dominantly caused by the low field strength and other factors, such as radiofrequency noise. Therefore, a long measurement time is usually necessary. This research paper is focused on the development of novel probes and preamplifiers for low-field MR scanners to improve SNR, and thus, shorten the measurement time. In this study, we describe the design of a high impedance preamplifier and a high temperature superconductor (HTS) coil. This novel instrumentation was compared with uncooled and cooled copper coils. Improvement in SNR in the case of an HTS coil is reported.

AB Supported by easier and cheaper access to tools and expanding communities, maker cultures are pointing towards the ideas of (almost) everyone designing, creating, producing and distributing renewed, new and improved products, machines, things or artefacts. A careful analysis of the assumptions and challenges of maker cultures emphasizes the relevance of what may be called technological action, that is, active and critical interventions regarding the purposes and applications of technologies within ordinary lives, thus countering the deterministic trends of current directions of technology. In such transformative potential, we will explore a set of elements what is and could be technological action through snapshots of maker cultures based on the empirical research conducted in three particular contexts: the Fab Lab Network, Maker Media core outputs and initiatives such as Maker Faires, and the Open Source Hardware Association (OSHWA). Elements such as control and empowerment through material engagement, openness and sharing, and social, cultural, political and ethical values of the common good in topics such as diversity, sustainability and transparency, are critically analysed.

AB The work environment for medical imaging such as distractions, ergonomics, distance, temperature, humidity, and lighting conditions generates a paucity of data and is difficult to analyze. The emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) with decreasing cost of single-board computers like Raspberry Pi makes creating customized hardware to collect data from the clinical environment within the reach of a clinical imaging informaticist. This article will walk the reader through a series of basic project using a variety sensors and devices in conjunction with a Pi to gather data, culminating in a complex example designed to automatically detect and log telephone calls.

AB Introduction: Companies selling dental implant guided systems mostly offer similar surgical guides. The purpose of this paper is to present an innovative-guided surgery system which originality lies in its guidance device, and to report the author's experience in using this system for dental implant surgery.
   Technical protocol: Two parallel tubes on either side of the drilling axis guide the successive drills and the implant placement. As a result of the lateral guidance, there is no friction of the drills on the surgical guide, which would damage it or contaminate the drilling hole with particles torn out from the guide. No radiological guide is needed during the radiographic examination stage. No successive diameter reduction tubes are requested. This guide can be used for all brands of implants.
   Discussion: In our experience, 67 implants (31 titanium and 36 zircon implants) were placed in 35 patients with guided surgery system. Multiple clinical cases were treated with this system: 'onestage' or a 'two-stage' surgical protocol, with flap and flapless surgical techniques, and with delayed or immediate loading. Clinical cases treated revealed good implant placement with planning. The widely open design of this guide allows irrigation and practitioner's sight control under conditions comparable to those of operations performed without surgical guide.
   Conclusion: This dental implant guided system appears to be a significant advance in the field of implant surgical guides. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: To retrospectively assess lurasidone effectiveness/efficacy/tolerability in bipolar disorder (BD) patients.
   Methods: Outpatients assessed with Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for BD Affective Disorders Evaluation received naturalistically administered (primarily adjunctive) open lurasidone while monitored at visits with the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for BD Clinical Monitoring Form.
   Results: Sixty-one patients (32 type I, 26 type II, 3 type not otherwise specified; mean SD age, 45.1 +/- 14.0 years; 63.9% were female) received lurasidone with 3.1 +/- 1.4 (2 in 88.5%, monotherapy in only 3.3%) other nonanxiolytic/hypnotic prescription psychotropics, started during syndromal depression in 57.4%, subsyndromal depression in 23.0%, and euthymia in 19.7%. Lurasidone was taken for median 126 days, with final dose 55.6 +/- 30.8 mg/d. By final visit taking lurasidone, syndromal depression rate decreased by nearly one-half to 31.1%, and euthymia rate more than doubled to 42.6%, whereas subsyndromal depression rate was unchanged at 23.0%. Clinical Global Impressions-BD-Overall Severity improved significantly only in patients with baseline syndromal depression. Seventy-seven percent of patients discontinued lurasidone after median 103 days, because of adverse events in 54.1% (most often akathisia, sedation/somnolence, nausea, and weight gain), inefficacy in 16.4%, and other reasons in 6.6%; 12.1% had equal to or greater than 7% weight gain, and 3.3% developed hypomania. Limitations to this study were the open design and demographically homogeneous (relatively affluent, predominantly white female) small sample taking complex pharmacotherapy.
   Conclusions: In American specialty clinic BD outpatients, adjunctive longer-term lurasidone commonly relieved syndromal depression and maintained euthymia, suggesting possible effectiveness/efficacy. However, lurasidone was discontinued in 54.1% because of adverse events, suggesting tolerability limitations in these challenging patients, nearly 90% of whom were already taking at least 2 other nonanxiolytic/hypnotic prescription psychotropics.

TI Open-source micro-tensile testers via additive manufacturing for the
   mechanical characterization of thin films and papers
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID GRAPHENE OXIDE; MICROSTRUCTURE CHARACTERIZATION; RECONSTRUCTION;
   METHODOLOGY; DESIGN
AB The cost of specialized scientific equipment can be high and with limited funding resources, researchers and students are often unable to access or purchase the ideal equipment for their projects. In the fields of materials science and mechanical engineering, fundamental equipment such as tensile testing devices can cost tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars. While a research lab often has access to a large-scale testing machine suitable for conventional samples, loading devices for meso-and micro-scale samples for in-situ testing with the myriad of microscopy tools are often hard to source and cost prohibitive. Open-source software has allowed for great strides in the reduction of costs associated with software development and open-source hardware and additive manufacturing have the potential to similarly reduce the costs of scientific equipment and increase the accessibility of scientific research. To investigate the feasibility of open-source hardware, a micro-tensile tester was designed with a freely accessible computer-aided design package and manufactured with a desktop 3D-printer and off-the-shelf components. To our knowledge this is one of the first demonstrations of a tensile tester with additively manufactured components for scientific research. The capabilities of the tensile tester were demonstrated by investigating the mechanical properties of Graphene Oxide (GO) paper and thin films. A 3D printed tensile tester was successfully used in conjunction with an atomic force microscope to provide one of the first quantitative measurements of GO thin film buckling under compression. The tensile tester was also used in conjunction with an atomic force microscope to observe the change in surface topology of a GO paper in response to increasing tensile strain. No significant change in surface topology was observed in contrast to prior hypotheses from the literature. Based on this result obtained with the new open source tensile stage we propose an alternative hypothesis we term 'superlamellae consolidation' to explain the initial deformation of GO paper. The additively manufactured tensile tester tested represents cost savings of > 99% compared to commercial solutions in its class and offers simple customization. However, continued development is needed for the tensile tester presented here to approach the technical specifications achievable with commercial solutions.

AB Bringing a new product to market involves both a creative ideation stage and an execution stage. When time-to-market constraints are binding, important questions are how to divide limited time between the two stages and who should make this decision. We introduce a laboratory experiment that closely resembles this setting: it features a product development task with an open design space, a downstream cost increase, and two development stages. We show that performance is significantly worse when designers choose for themselves when to transition from ideation to execution and that decision control explains a large share of performance variation even after controlling for individual differences. How the time is allocated between ideation and execution does not affect mean performance, but later transition increases risk. One driver of poor design outcomes in the designer-initiated transition regime are delays in physical construction and testing of designs. We show that such delays can be prevented by "nudging" designers toward early prototyping. However, the most important performance driver is the lack of task structure in endogenous regimes, which can be remedied by demanding a concrete, performance-oriented deliverable prior to a transition.

AB Fog computing is gaining attention due to the potential of aggregating and processing time-sensitive data at the nearby intelligent gateways. It reduces the latency of sensors data aggregation and response time therefore, improve real-time action which is beneficial in environmental monitoring and early warning systems. However, deploying edge computing in Internet-less environment seems unpractical and the mobility of gateways is less focused in current literature. In this paper, we present a practical design of a portable gateways scheme for sensors data aggregation and processing in Internet-less environment. The proposed gateways can locate their geographical locations which can be automatically converted into location names at the central gateway. The proposed portable Fog Gateways are developed by using open-source hardware and integrated with Cloud database for data storage. Data processing techniques such as data parsing and Reverse Geocoding are conducted for reliable data transmission by using GSM/GPRS technology and geographical location name detection respectively. Finally, a case study has been conducted to evaluate the feasibility of our proposed Fog Gateways scheme in real-time application.

AB 1. The cost, usability and power efficiency of available wildlife monitoring equipment currently inhibits full ground-level coverage of many natural systems. Developments over the last decade in technology, open science, and the sharing economy promise to bring global access to more versatile and more affordable monitoring tools, to improve coverage for conservation researchers and managers.
   2. Here we describe the development and proof-of-concept of a low-cost, small-sized and low-energy acoustic detector: "AudioMoth." The device is open-source and programmable, with diverse applications for recording animal calls or human activity at sample rates of up to 384 kHz. We briefly outline two ongoing real-world case studies of large-scale, long-term monitoring for biodiversity and exploitation of natural resources. These studies demonstrate the potential for AudioMoth to enable a substantial shift away from passive continuous recording by individual devices, towards smart detection by networks of devices flooding large and inaccessible ecosystems.
   3. The case studies demonstrate one of the smart capabilities of AudioMoth, to trigger event logging on the basis of classification algorithms that identify specific acoustic events. An algorithm to trigger recordings of the New Forest cicada (Cicadetta montana) demonstrates the potential for AudioMoth to vastly improve the spatial and temporal coverage of surveys for the presence of cryptic animals. An algorithm for logging gunshot events has potential to identify a shotgun blast in tropical rainforest at distances of up to 500 m, extending to 1 km with continuous recording.
   4. AudioMoth is more energy efficient than currently available passive acoustic monitoring devices, giving it considerably greater portability and longevity in the field with smaller batteries. At a build cost of similar to US$43 per unit, AudioMoth has potential for varied applications in large-scale, long-term acoustic surveys. With continuing developments in smart, energy-efficient algorithms and diminishing component costs, we are approaching the milestone of local communities being able to afford to remotely monitor their own natural resources.

AB Salmonella 1,4,[ 5], 12: i:- accounts currently for one of the most common serotypes observed worldwide. These isolates do not express the FljB flagellin and mostly derive from Salmonella Typhimurium. They are therefore termed Salmonella Typhimurium monophasic variants (STMV) and are considered of comparable public health risk. Since serological identification of the somatic and flagellar antigens of STMV is not sufficient to demonstrate relatedness with Salmonella Typhimurium, additional assays detecting genetic markers unique to Salmonella Typhimurium are required. In addition, identification of the mutations affecting expression of the flagellar gene fljB can be useful to support the monophasic character observed phenotypically. Finally, genetic subtyping of the various mono-and biphasic Salmonella Typhimurium clonal groups can facilitate their epidemiological follow-up. Here, we present a home-made liquid bead array able to fulfill these requirements. This array confirmed the monophasic character of 240 STMV isolates collected in Belgium during 2014-2015 and identified 10 genetic subtypes. Microevolution in and around the fljB locus linked to IS26 insertions is probably one of the driven force accounting for STMV population diversity. Thanks to its open design, other genetic signatures could later be merged to the assay to subtype additional STMV clonal groups and to detect rare mutations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Homogenous static magnetic field coils dedicated to portable nuclear

SO JOURNAL OF SENSORS AND SENSOR SYSTEMS

DT Article
ID RADIOFREQUENCY COIL
AB Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments are usually carried out at very high and homogenous magnetic fields. However, portable systems have emerged in recent years at low fields, offering many advantages like easier maintenance and open design that permit us to imagine a variety of coil configurations in order to maximize the homogeneity of the static field B-0 and the radio-frequency field B-1. The wire winding distribution based on space harmonics suppression (SHS) of the cosine current density distribution offers new possibilities of producing homogenous static fields B-0. In this work, an extension of the SHS method, allowing homogeneity enhancement and flexibility of the coil design, is presented. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated through the construction of homogenous magnetic field coils dedicated to a very low magnetic field (8 mT) H-1 NMR spectrometer. The performance of these coils in terms of magnetic field intensity and homogeneity as well as self-heating behavior is compliant with in planta experiments for agronomic studies.

ID REACTIONWARE
AB Scientific communities are drawn to the open source model as an increasingly utilitarian method to produce and share work. Initially used as a means to develop freely-available software, open source projects have been applied to hardware including scientific tools. Increasing convenience of 3D printing has fueled the proliferation of open labware projects aiming to develop and share designs for scientific tools that can be produced in-house as inexpensive alternatives to commercial products. We present our design of a micropipette that is assembled from 3D-printable parts and some hardware that works by actuating a disposable syringe to a user-adjustable limit. Graduations on the syringe are used to accurately adjust the set point to the desired volume. Our open design printed micropipette is assessed in comparison with a commercial pipette and meets the ISO 8655 standards.

LA English
DT Article
DE factor of safety; factor of frugality; sustainable development; frugal
   innovation; research
AB In recent years, frugal innovations have become widely popular due to their no-frills nature that entails lower costs. However, most of the frugal innovations, at least at the grassroots level, are makeshift contraptions, made from indigenous ingenuity, that achieve their goals under constraints on various resources but may suffer from limited lifespans due to premature failure. Consequently, it is imperative that sound scientific principles not be overlooked or haphazardly applied in realizing these innovations, irrespective of their grassroots or sophisticated nature. This article therefore argues for the need to use science, sometimes at the cutting edge, to realize grassroots and advanced frugal innovations that are not prone to failure under various working conditions. In so doing, this work advocates the use of classical and new design methodologies that are rooted in science to save resources and, hence lower costs, while aiming for robust functionality of frugal products. In particular, a frugal design approach using a modern version of the safety factor called the "factor of frugality" has been propounded to effectively create any type of frugal innovation from scratch. By combining the ingenuity of the resourceful creators of frugal innovations with a scientific approach that aims to make the resulting products "fail proof", such innovations may better contribute value to business and benefits to society.

AB Purpose The Italian Network of Longitudinal Metropolitan Studies (IN-LiMeS) is a system of integrated data on health outcomes, demographic and socioeconomic information, and represents a powerful tool to study health inequalities.
   Participants IN-LiMeS is a multicentre and multipurpose pool of metropolitan population cohorts enrolled in nine Italian cities: Turin, Venice, Reggio Emilia, Modena, Bologna, Florence, Leghorn, Prato and Rome. Data come from record linkage of municipal population registries, the 2001 population census, mortality registers and hospital discharge archives. Depending on the source of enrolment, cohorts can be closed or open. The census-based closed cohort design includes subjects resident in any of the nine cities at the 2001 census day; 4 466 655 individuals were enrolled in 2001 in the nine closed cohorts. The open cohort design includes subjects resident in 2001 or subsequently registered by birth or immigration until the latest available follow-up (currently 31 December 2013). The open cohort design is available for Turin, Venice, Reggio Emilia, Modena, Bologna, Prato and Rome. Detailed socioeconomic data are available for subjects enrolled in the census-based cohorts; information on demographic characteristics, education and citizenship is available from population registries.
   Findings to date The first IN-LiMeS application was the study of differentials in mortality between immigrants and Italians. Either using a closed cohort design (nine cities) or an open one (Turin and Reggio Emilia), individuals from high migration pressure countries generally showed a lower mortality risk. However, a certain heterogeneity between the nine cities was noted, especially among men, and an excess mortality risk was reported for some macroareas of origin and specific causes of death.
   Future plans We are currently working on the linkage of the 2011 population census data, the expansion of geographical coverage and the implementation of the open design in all the participating cohorts.

AB Applications involving data acquisition from sensors need samples at a preset frequency rate, the filtering out of noise and/or analysis of certain frequency components. We propose a novel software architecture based on open-software hardware platforms which allows programmers to create data streams from input channels and easily implement filters and frequency analysis objects. The performances of the different classes given in the size of memory allocated and execution time (number of clock cycles) were analyzed in the low-cost platform Arduino Genuino. In addition, 11 people took part in an experiment in which they had to implement several exercises and complete a usability test. Sampling rates under 250 Hz (typical for many biomedical applications) makes it feasible to implement filters, sliding windows and Fourier analysis, operating in real time. Participants rated software usability at 70.2 out of 100 and the ease of use when implementing several signal processing applications was rated at just over 4.4 out of 5. Participants showed their intention of using this software because it was percieved as useful and very easy to use. The performances of the library showed that it may be appropriate for implementing small biomedical real-time applications or for human movement monitoring, even in a simple open-source hardware device like Arduino Genuino. The general perception about this library is that it is easy to use and intuitive.

AB Fashion design pedagogy in higher education needs to engage with emergent consumer-led consumption schemes that are problematizing the roles of producer and consumer. Traditional fashion design pedagogy does not explicitly teach students to reveal the systems of fashion production to consumers, thus distancing them from the materials and processes that animate consumer products. Consumers are at a disadvantage as they have little agency over or knowledge of how garments are produced in the global top-down fashion system - a system that could be characterized as a black box. In response to this, consumers and designers have been employing concepts from hacker culture and the sharing economy in order to participate in novel consumption schemes that focus on underlying values of openness, transparency and collaboration. This article reviews a number of these schemes, using secondary sources, and proposes that their underlying values be introduced into sustainable fashion curriculums.

ID THERAPY; PERFORMANCE
AB BACKGROUND: In our large community hospital, we observed that traditional oxygen masks were sometimes set at an inappropriately low flow. We hoped to eliminate this safety concern through adoption of an open-design oxygen mask. We also hoped that more immediate flow changes would lead to a decrease in medical gas consumption. Finally, by standardizing to one mask, goals were to reduce the cost of oxygen delivery. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis, 12 months before and 12 months after implementation of the open-design oxygen mask. Unusual occurrence reports related to supplemental oxygen delivery were reviewed. Oxygen device use and bulk oxygen consumption were recorded. The total number of patient days was obtained from the electronic medical record. RESULTS: There were no unusual occurrence reports or concerns involving an oxygen device in those areas that converted to the open-design oxygen mask. In fiscal year 2014, bulk oxygen use was 13,036,686 cubic feet, and there were 74,734 patient days. In fiscal year 2016, bulk oxygen use was 12,072,610 cubic feet and there were 99,428 patient days. The reduction in oxygen consumption was $3,670 despite the increase in patient days. In fiscal year 2014, 3,848 oxygen devices were used for a cost of $3,411, and in fiscal year 2016, 5,512 devices were used for a cost of $12,963. The net savings from open-design oxygen mask conversion was $23,487 annual and corrected for increased patient population. Oxygen consumption and supply cost per patient day resulted in $1.19 per patient day pre-implementation and $0.95 after implementation of the open-design oxygen mask (P = .003). CONCLUSIONS: The open-design oxygen mask may be a safe and less costly alternative to traditional oxygen delivery devices. (c) 2018 Daedalus Enterprises

AB Background: Accelerometer-based technologies could be useful in providing objective measures of canine ambulation, but most are either not tailored to the idiosyncrasies of canine gait, or, use un-validated or closed source approaches. The aim of this paper was to validate algorithms which could be applied to accelerometer data for i) counting the number of steps and ii) distance travelled by a dog. To count steps, an approach based on partitioning acceleration was used. Thiswas applied to accelerometer data from13 dogs which were walked a set distance and filmed. Each footfall captured on video was annotated. In a second experiment, an approach based on signal features was used to estimate distance travelled. This was applied to accelerometer data from 10 dogs with osteoarthritis during normal walks with their owners where GPS (Global Positioning System) was also captured. Pearson's correlations and Bland Altman statistics were used to compare i) the number of steps measured on video footage and predicted by the algorithm and ii) the distance travelled estimated by GPS and predicted by the algorithm.
   Results: Both step count and distance travelled could be estimated accurately by the algorithms presented in this paper: 4695 steps were annotated from the video and the pedometer was able to detect 91%. GPS logged a total of 20,184 m meters across all dogs; the mean difference between the predicted and GPS estimated walk length was 211 m and the mean similarity was 79%.
   Conclusions: The algorithms described show promise in detecting number of steps and distance travelled from an accelerometer. The approach for detecting steps might be advantageous to methods which estimate gross activity because these include energy output from stationary activities. The approach for estimating distance might be suited to replacing GPS in indoor environments or others with limited satellite signal. The algorithms also allow for temporal and spatial components of ambulation to be calculated. Temporal and spatial aspects of dog ambulation are clinical indicators which could be used for diagnosis or monitoring of certain diseases, or used to provide information in support of canine weight-loss programmes.

AB Thermal Pyranometers are very important devices for evaluating the intensity of solar radiation under different climatic conditions. These devices utilize thermal radiation for comparison and determination of their efficiency. Because of this wide use associated with the development of new technologies, a simple and low-cost version of thermal pyranometer has been studied, designed and manufactured. A blackened aluminum disk is used as a hot junction, and the cold junction is exposed to ambient air. The two terminals are connected to a digital amplifier with output signal directed to an Arduino board. A device calibration was performed by comparing the results with a commercial photodiode sensor. Statistical analysis of the calibration data considering a 99% confidence level leads to an estimated standard error of 20.8 W/m(2). An analysis of its response time also estimated from a dynamic model. This model uses a numerical solution of the energy balance on heat exchange between the aluminum disc and the environment. The instrument response time based on the average of the estimates obtained from the dynamic model is about 1.5 minutes. Based on these studies it was concluded that the characteristics of the sensor are adequate for most solar energy tests and the final cost of US $ 60.00 is much lower than the large majority of such commercial devices.

AB Slot die coating is growing in popularity because it is a low operational cost and easily scaled processing technique for depositing thin and uniform films rapidly, while minimizing material waste. The complex inner geometry of conventional slot dies require expensive machining that limits accessibility and experimentation. In order to overcome these issues this study follows an open hardware approach, which uses an open source 3-D printer to both fabricate the slot die and then to functionalize a 3-D slot die printing system. Polymer materials are tested and selected for compatibility with common solvents and used to fabricate a custom slot die head. This slot die is then integrated into a 3-D printer augmented with a syringe pump to form an additive manufacturing platform for thin film semiconductor devices. The full design of the slot die system is disclosed here using an open source license including software and operational protocols. This study demonstrates that functional lab-grade slot dies may be 3-D printed using low-cost open source hardware methods A case study using NiO2 found an RMS value 0.486 nm, thickness of 17-49 nm, and a maximum optical transmission of 99.1%, which shows this additive manufacturing approach to slot die depositions as well of fabrication is capable of producing viable layers of advanced electronic materials. Using this method, a cost savings of over 17,000% was obtained when compared to commercial slot die systems for laboratories. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs) are increasingly being deployed for surveillance and monitoring applications. WMSNs applications produce large amount of data, which require high transmission rates. An efficient and seamless delivery of multimedia services in WMSNs is still a challenging task. This article proposes an intelligent video surveillance platform (IVSP) for wireless multimedia sensor networks. IVSP presents the design of a networked system for joint rate control and error control of video over resource-constrained embedded devices. First, a combination of two different congestion indicators is introduced to differentiate between congestion levels and handle them accordingly. Second, a feedback-based rate controller is developed to maximize received video quality, in which sensor nodes can adaptively adjust their sending rates. Finally, a different retransmission mechanism for different packets is proposed. Lost packets can be stored temporarily and resend when free channel is available to avoid congestion. The core component of IVSP is an open source hardware platform, which is based on Raspberry Pi sensor nodes. IVSP is extensively evaluated on 7 Raspberry Pi sensor nodes. We present the results of 7-node real-world deployment of IVSP in a video surveillance application and show that it works well in long-term deployments.

AB Currently, Internet of Things (IoT) technologies are used in many areas, such as intelligent transportation, smart city, hospital, games, education. Earlier interactive response system uses infrared or radio frequency (RF) wireless communication technologies to transmit the students' answer to teachers' managerment system, where there exists high cost, inconvenient usage, difficult deployment. How to use IoT to improve the quality of higher education becomes a very important topic in the researh area of teaching. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is one of key technologies to implement IoT applications, and most of universities use the High Frequency (HF) RFID card as the students' identification devices in China. In this paper, a kind of WiFi supported RFID reader (WiRF) is implemented using open source hardware platforms, such as Node MCU and RFID-RC522. Then the proposed WiRF system is used to assist teacher to perform automatic attendance record and students' behavior record. In addition, Quick Response (QR) code is another technology to enable IoT. In this paper, QR code is designed to quickly access course video and perform real-time interactive response in the classroom, which will provide multidimensional learning and strengthen the motivation of students' learning. This IoT system can improve the attendance of students, and give a positive impact on students' learning process for higher education.

AB Addressing the navigation (localization and motion control) problem of a mobile robot, coupled with its mapping problem, remains a significant challenge to date. The well-known simultaneous localization and mapping problem of mobile robots has been addressed in the literaturewithout specifically taking into account the robot's motion control tasks. Moreover, its implementation can cost more than the robot itself. Robot motion control strategies developed in the literature either 1) rely on sophisticated hardware platforms, 2) assume noise-free environment, or 3) are based on abstract theories, which are validated using computer simulations only. The current work solves the navigation and mapping problems of mobile robots using open-source hardware and range-only measurements from a network of radio sources. The hardware platform used in this work is customized such that it is cost-effective and easy-to-implement, addressing the aforementioned issues in developing motion control strategies. The current strategy permits the robot to estimate its position and orientation and builds a map of its operating environment using radio frequency signals received from radio sources. It then navigates through a path defined by a set of two-dimensional points on the ground using a motion control strategy in cooperation with a computational intelligence tool. The proposed robot navigation and mapping scheme was tested in an indoor laboratory environment and its performance was compared with the simulation counterpart using a commercial robot simulator.

AB This paper deals with the design and development of a low cost building environmental monitoring system, and it is based on Open Source Platforms and on the Internet of Things. To achieve this aim, a wireless micro-controller with attached sensors has been used to collect the environmental data. The information obtained from the sensors is collected and stored in a flash memory card, and simultaneously is sent via WiFi to the cloud. This data is stored in an online spreadsheet, which permits us to access the information in real time.
   On the other hand, a comparative analysis of the results obtained from sensors has been carried out, thanks to which several guidance guidelines have been developed for the selection of the most appropriate environmental sensor for each project. Finally, an additional evaluation of the device has been carried out through the analysis of its energy performance and providing information related to the data storage and its cost of development.
   The current research shows a clear ability to develop monitoring systems for the building sector, which can also be extended to multiple applications of Smart Environments. The development of projects through these platforms will allow future research to tackle the existing barriers in monitoring campaigns.

AB Rapid manufacturing using 3-D printing is a potential solution to some of the most pressing issues for humanitarian logistics. In this paper, findings are reported from a study that involved development of a new type of 3-D printer. In particular, a novel 3-D printer that is designed specifically for reliable rapid manufacturing at the sites of humanitarian crises. First, required capabilities are developed with design elements of a humanitarian 3-D printer, which include, (1) fused filament fabrication, (2) open source self-replicating rapid prototyper design, (3) modular, (4) separate frame, (5) protected electronics, (6) on-board computing, (7) flexible power supply, and (8) climate control mechanisms. The technology is then disclosed with an open source license for the Kijenzi 3-D Printer. A swarm of five Kijenzi 3-D printers are evaluated for rapid part manufacturing for two months at health facilities and other community locations in both rural and urban areas throughout Kisumu County, Kenya. They were successful for their ability to function independently of infrastructure, transportability, ease of use, ability to withstand harsh environments and costs. The results are presented and conclusions are drawn about future work necessary for the Kijenzi 3-D Printer to meet the needs of rapid manufacturing in a humanitarian context.

DE FPGA-as-a-service; hardware acceleration; open-source hardware
AB Major cloud service providers, including Amazon and Microsoft, have started employing field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to build high-performance and low-power-consumption cloud capability. However, utilizing an FPGA-enabled cloud is still challenging because of two main reasons. First, the introduction of software and hardware co-design leads to high development complexity. Second, FPGA virtualization and accelerator scheduling techniques are not fully researched for cluster deployment. In this paper, we propose an open-source FPGA-as-a-service (FaaS) platform, the hCODE, to simplify the design, management and deployment of FPGA accelerators at cluster scale. The proposed platform implements a Shell-and-IP design pattern and an open accelerator repository to reduce design and management costs of FPGA projects. Efficient FPGA virtualization and accelerator scheduling techniques are proposed to deploy accelerators on the FPGA-enabled cluster easily. With the proposed hCODE, hardware designers and accelerator users can be organized on one platform to efficiently build open-hardware ecosystem.

AB This paper presents an adjacent feeders search based method for service restoration of distribution systems after single faults. The developed algorithm makes a search for sections that belong to adjacent feeders and comply with two conditions: have normally open equipment installed or have a three or more derivations. As soon as the sections are selected, an exhaustive search is executed to achieve the restoration plan. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, service restoration on a typical distribution system of Taiwan Power Company is applied. The results are compared with others approaches and show that the proposed method can provide a restoration plan very efficiently even under different load levels.

AB In this study, the effect of web based power electronics courses on the success of electrical engineering candidates was examined. The participants are consisted of daytime education (30) and evening education (42) students who attended the "Power Electronics" course. First, groups were randomly assigned as experimental and control groups and experimental group and control group were examined according to the students' GPAs, university entrance exam results, academic grades depending on 8 different lectures related with power electronics.
   According to the results obtained from validity and reliability of Power Electronics Course Achievement Test, the total correlation values and the standard deviation values of Power Electronics Course Achievement Test were between.301-,.598 and between.304-,.506, respectively. In addition, KR20 coefficient was found as 0.844. Before application of the "Power Electronics Course Achievement Test", there was not a significant difference in total scores of both daytime and evening education students. Although students received Web-Based Education and Web Aided Education were selected as experimental group, the students received "Traditional Education" were selected as control group. After the application, significant differences between the total grade points of both experimental and control groups of daytime education and evening education students were detected.

AB We report the development of a multichannel microscopy for whole-slide multiplane, multispectral and phase imaging. We use trinocular heads to split the beam path into 6 independent channels and employ a camera array for parallel data acquisition, achieving a maximum data throughput of approximately 1 gigapixel per second. To perform single-frame rapid autofocusing, we place 2 near-infrared light-emitting diodes (LEDs) at the back focal plane of the condenser lens to illuminate the sample from 2 different incident angles. A hot mirror is used to direct the near-infrared light to an autofocusing camera. For multiplane whole-slide imaging (WSI), we acquire 6 different focal planes of a thick specimen simultaneously. For multispectral WSI, we relay the 6 independent image planes to the same focal position and simultaneously acquire information at 6 spectral bands. For whole-slide phase imaging, we acquire images at 3 focal positions simultaneously and use the transport-of-intensity equation to recover the phase information. We also provide an open-source design to further increase the number of channels from 6 to 15. The reported platform provides a simple solution for multiplexed fluorescence imaging and multimodal WSI. Acquiring an instant focal stack without z-scanning may also enable fast 3-dimensional dynamic tracking of various biological samples.

ID LIGHT-EMITTING-DIODES; POLLUTION; SANTIAGO; NETWORK; CHILE
AB We propose a new application of inexpensive light-emitting diode (LED)-based Sun photometers, consisting of measuring the aerosol optical thickness (AOT) with high resolution within metropolitan scales. Previously, these instruments have been used at continental scales by the GLOBE program, but this extension is already covered by more expensive and higher-precision instruments of the AERONET global network. For this we built an open source two-channeled LED-based Sun photometer based on previous developments, with improvements in the hardware, software, and modifications on the calibration procedure. Among these we highlight the use of MODTRAN to characterize the effect introduced by using LED sensors in the AOT retrieval, an open design available for the scientific community and a calibration procedure that takes advantage of a CIMEL Sun photometer located within the city, enables the intercomparison of several LED Sun photometers with a common reference. We estimated the root-mean-square error in the AOT retrieved by the prototypes as 0.006 at the 564nm and 0.009 at the 408nm. This error is way under the magnitude of the AOT daily cycle variability measured by us in our campaigns, even for distances closer than 15km. In addition to inner city campaigns, we also show aerosol-tracing applications by measuring AOT variations from the city of Santiago to the Andes glaciers. Measuring AOT at high spatial resolution in urban areas can improve our understanding of urban scale aerosol circulation, providing information for solar energy planning, health policies, and climatological studies, among others.

AB The 'open approach' is rooted in the open-source and free-software movements. Its application has spread to more fields than computer engineering. Product design is impacted as well: we observe new stakeholders and practices challenging current structured design processes and leading to industrial successes. Open-design appears to be promising yet disruptive. Moreover, its distinctive features remain unclear.
   This paper aims to popularize this new concept, as well as to give both researchers and practitioners an overview of current research on open-design, and its consequences on design. For this, we conducted a systematic quantitative bibliometric analysis of 624 entries corresponding to the keyword open-design' in the Scopus database. This supports a qualitative synthesis of scientific literature, enabling us to summarize practices falling under the umbrella term open-design'. As such, this paper traces the evolution of product design and the open approach. It also analyzes the impact of open-design on the design process as presented in the scientific literature. Finally, this paper develops a typology of open-design of tangible artifacts that distinguishes among three currently reported varieties of practice: do-it-yourself, meta-design, and industrial ecosystems. As the major contribution of this paper, this typology is developed as a final discussion.

AB Neural network formation is a complex process involving axon outgrowth and guidance. Axon guidance is facilitated by structural and molecular cues from the surrounding microenvironment. Micro-fabrication techniques can be employed to produce microfluidic chips with a highly controlled microenvironment for neural cells enabling longitudinal studies of complex processes associated with network formation. In this work, we demonstrate a novel open microfluidic chip design that encompasses a freely variable number of nodes interconnected by axon-permissible tunnels, enabling structuring of multi-nodal neural networks in vitro. The chip employs a partially open design to allow high level of control and reproducibility of cell seeding, while reducing shear stress on the cells. We show that by culturing dorsal root ganglion cells( DRGs) in our microfluidic chip, we were able to structure a neural network in vitro. These neurons were compartmentalized within six nodes interconnected through axon growth tunnels. Furthermore, we demonstrate the additional benefit of open top design by establishing a 3D neural culture in matrigel and a neuronal aggregate 3D culture within the chips. In conclusion, our results demonstrate a novel microfluidic chip design applicable to structuring complex neural networks in vitro, thus providing a versatile, highly relevant platform for the study of neural network dynamics applicable to developmental and regenerative neuroscience.

AB The current ongoing work of the CubeSat Development Initiative is to build a small spacecraft system using open source software and open hardware principles. The main objective of the development is to give access to space for little payloads, which can be planned and executed by researchers, designers and even understudies majoring in science, technology, engineering, and math and different orders to play out a huge number of planned missions. To design and develop any system, requirement engineering plays a vital role as it describes the functional and non-functional requirements of the system. The work presented in this paper is focused on developing a requirement engineering tool that can be used to increase the requirement elicitation and specification of system-wide qualities based on the use of quality attribute scenarios. The model-based requirement engineering tool described in the paper allows to link non-functional requirements and functional requirements. It utilizes quality attribute scenarios (templates) which are proposed by Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute (SEI).

AB The rise of emerging technologies and the emergence of open and free hardware and software trends have allowed the emergence of new embedded system options such as the Nodemcu card based on the esp8266 microcontroller, among many others, which at very low cost allows implement an On/Off control or domotic control for an environment or location that improves its comfort and energy saving conditions as main objectives. Understanding home automation as the system capable of automating a home or building of any kind, which is capable of providing energy management, security, welfare, maintenance and communication services, and which can be integrated by means of wireless networks or Wi-Fi technology, to give a control that provides certain ubiquity, from inside and outside the place through the use of an application or app, provides a huge opportunity to take advantage of current technology adapted to any type of environment or space. This use could be defined as the integration of technology in the intelligent design of a closed area, including conventional training environments or classrooms, which unlike the rest of other locations or modern properties, do not enjoy the same advances with which they enjoy new establishments of offices, banks and hotels that make our daily activities more pleasant. This research will use the quasiexperimental method since with the collaboration of experts through the network and the state of the art consulted, small experiments or tests have been developed using low-cost technology modules, thus checking the functioning of different connections and configurations, which generates the sending and receiving of data, which allows us to give or not advance to the analysis, programming and revision of the behavior of the occupation of an environment, making the focus towards a short-term future of the research quantitative.

AB In developing countries like India, the school and college education systems are mired in the passive, teacher-centric pedagogy based on rote learning. Active, student-centric STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art and math) learning can be achieved through extremely affordable open source hardware and free open source software to foster innovation and creativity among teachers and students in colleges and universities as well as schools. In particular, build your own and do-it-yourself (BYO/DIY) robots and tabletop subtractive and additive manufacturing machines can be designed, fabricated and disseminated for hands-on education in design, electronics, programming, robotics and manufacturing. This paper discusses an ongoing collaborative project between a higher educational institution, a non-profit foundation and a corporate sponsor to establish and operate project-based STEAM learning labs in resource-poor government high schools in nine Indian cities. The work reported is the schools outreach part of a Teaching Learning Centre for design, development and dissemination of low-cost manufacturing education technologies for engineering colleges and universities. The methodology can be replicated with locale-specific adaptations in schools elsewhere.

AB This research explores the real-time process control of polymer flowability in Powder Bed Fusion (PBF). To do so, a novel system based on machine vision and an image-processing algorithm was developed and tested in an open hardware and software PBF system. The system has the ability to analyze the quality of the powder bed by computing a defect ratio of the powder bed after each recoating operation. Then, this ratio is used as a performance variable in three full factorial Design of Experiments (DOE). The results show that the installation of machine vision and image processing system can potentially provide a signal to repeat the recoating process and correct the defect on the powder bed. At the same time, recoating process parameters can be adjusted dynamically to guarantee an optimum quality of the powder bed and minimize possible build failures.

AB We describe the development of a robust, self sustainable, versatile environmental monitoring station, the S3ME2, with a multitude of sensors capable of operating in extreme environments (from cold arid sub -arctic retOorts to hot deserts and high -altitude mountain terrains), providing realtime quality data of ctitical climate and geophysical parameters for a wide field of research such as pressure, surface and subsurface temperature and llimidity, magnetic field and seismic activity-. The dedicated communication modem utilizes loT technolo*, and can deliver this data from remote regions. The S3ME2 has been designed as a low-cost instrument to facilitate the production of multiple units. During the pilot phase, it has demonstrated continuous operability for up to 6 months, including survival (luting extremely cold, snowy, and low insolation, and low wind periods in the Sub -Arctic region. With its robust desim, S3ME2 exploits the use of renewable sources of enert,,,y such as solar and wind power to power the system. The S3ME2 has also been desigited from a modular point of view with commercial off the shelf components (COTS) and open source hardware, considering long term operability of tbe station. The sensor modules cart be easily addetl, replaced, or upgraded such that a stable functioning of the system is g,uaranteed.

ID LESSONS
AB It has been identified from literature that affordability is the main constraint faced by the majority of MANET (Mobile Ad-hoc Network) researchers which sees them forgoing implementing real world experimental studies that are costlier, in favour of opting for cheaper simulation tools instead. While simulation tools provide a simple and inexpensive method to gain an understanding of algorithms and protocols in MANET research, its reliability and accuracy in representing real systems and contexts are critically limited. Thus, this paper unveils the ToMRobot, created with low budget using ordinary remote control (RC) car coupled with a few low cost electronic components, to serve as a fully functional MANET testbed. Provided in this paper are practical knowhow to model and produce ToMRobot from scratch specifically targeted to facilitate less technical savvy MANET researchers. Despite being really economical, significantly inexpensive to create, highly customizable with flexible option that allows researchers to upgrade by utilizing components such as Arduino and Cubieboard2 from technologies that can be sourced from open hardware, ToMRobot still maintains all aspects of MANET rudimentary structures. It is hoped that the guidelines contained within this paper will help MANET researchers to build robots that can be used in their future MANET testbeds, which will in turn ultimately increase the number of MANET researchers who choose testbeds as their evaluation tool.

AB This paper presents insights from an ethnographic study with a diverse population of makers in the city of Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. By engaging individuals, groups and communities who 'make' in different contexts, we reveal under-explored perspectives on 'making' and highlight points of intersection between different kinds of making across the city. We reflect on the dynamics of these intersections and connect our observations to emerging discourses around 'open design'. In doing so, we argue for a renewed focus on 'inclusivity' and highlight a need for new infrastructure to support iterative, collaborative making within - and across - interconnected networks of makers.

AB Recent years demonstrate an increased interest in low-cost Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) in citizen science for ecological monitoring and environmental protection. However, most efforts have targeted land use, leaving ocean and nautical applications greatly unexplored. In this paper we present the design, deployment and testing of POSEIDON, a low-cost PAM system for nautical citizen science and real-time acoustic augmentation of whale-watching experiences. POSEIDON uses machine learning techniques to identify vocal acoustic samples of common cetaceans like whales and dolphins. When discriminating the calls, we find that Extra Trees and Gradient Boosting outperform other classifiers (>0.95 confidence threshold). The features extracted from the machine learning models are used to enhance the whale watching experience and provide citizen science data to marine biologists and environmental protection agencies. While this paper focuses on the design of the system, future work will focus on user testing and widespread deployment of open-hardware and software for nautical PAM applications.

AB Enriching the lives of animals under human care is not a new concept but the methods of doing so are rapidly evolving in zoos. Zoo-based enrichment is traditionally low-tech, often failing to maintain animals' long-term interest. Meanwhile, evaluating the intricacies of enrichment device use remains difficult. 'Cognitive' enrichment aims to challenge animals' evolved cognitive skills and ACI shows promise in revolutionizing its practice.
   We present 'Gorilla Game Lab', a project designing, implementing and evaluating high-tech cognitive enrichment with seven zoo-housed Western lowland gorillas. We study the role of modular, tangible cognitive enrichment, assimilating motivational game design principles, in maintaining engaging, playful interactions. Taking an 'animal-centred' design approach, informed by the gorillas and the humans responsible for their welfare as design contributors, we introduce our rapid prototyping process. We also explore how integrating digital tracking, IoT and open source design, can contribute to creating a world-class method for enhancing zoo animal welfare.

AB The recent emergence of open hardware platforms has drastically reduced the cost required to develop special purpose device architectures. The RISC-V instruction set and associated ecosystem is one such architecture that has become widely popular as the basis for the next generation embedded control systems and IoT devices.
   Despite the recent popularity of the RISC-V architecture, there is currently very little support for performing architectural experiments of high performance RISC-V devices designed to target high performance computing and high performance analytics applications. Further, there are no general purpose simulation infrastructures that support developing architectural experiments using RISC-V cores coupled to emerging memory devices such as HBM and HMC. As a result, there is currently a significant gap for those seeking to develop high performance architectural models using emerging memory devices and the RISC-V instruction set.
   The Stake infrastructure is designed to provide integrated simulation capabilities that supports experimentation using RISC-V processing cores as well as emerging memory devices. Stake is constructed using a fusion of the existing RISC-V Spike functional simulation infrastructure coupled to a custom memory generation component within the Sandia Structural Simulation (SST) framework. The result being an integrated simulation infrastructure that has the ability to simulate heterogeneous mixtures of hierarchical caches, traditional DRAM memories and emerging memory devices. We demonstrate this infrastructure with a design study to elicit the efficacy of 64 bit RISC-V cores on executing graph applications using different mixtures of cache, DRAM memories and HMC memories. In this study, we utilize the Graph Analytics Benchmark Suite to drive simulated memory traffic into mixtures of single level and multi-level caches coupled to each of the aforementioned backend memory devices. From this, we determine that in our simulated architecture, the HMC memory configuration with a single (L1) caching layer provides the most advantageous system configuration for executing graph algorithms and applications.

AB Open Source Hardware (OSH) products are those whose design are made publicly available so that anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, and sell them. In spite of the increasing popularity of this novel approach to intellectual property in product innovation, practice communities have faced difficulties to refine this concept into sharp and practical terms. There is to date no widely acknowledged criteria for determining whether a product is open source or not. Assuming OSH follows the same development path as Open Source Software and becomes a mainstream approach, the issue of conformance will also become critical for both producers and consumers. To address this gap, this contribution introduces a self-declared product openness marking scheme allowing to rate the openness of a product. Looking forward, it provides conceptual inputs for the future establishment of technical standards bringing clarity in this emerging and moving field. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Computer education is in the midst of a major transformation as a result of the rapid emergence of new technologies, intersection of computing with other disciplines and growing interest among students in computing courses. Such transformation prompted educators to redefine the way computing education is delivered and experiment a wide range of learning approaches. One of these approaches is the integration of hardware prototyping platforms such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi and Intel Internet of Things as part of project-based learning. These platforms have become in recent years instrumental tools for improving students' learning process and promoting proactive thinking. The aim of this study is to investigate the usefulness of integrating low cost open-source hardware platforms into engineering and computer science courses. In particular, we explore the use of an experiential learning approach using these kits for improving the students' learning experience in computer science and engineering courses. Throughout this paper, we discuss the outcome of our investigation and provide insights on how to make classrooms more experiential using the hardware prototyping paradigm.

AB This full paper proposes an educational methodology to teaching and learning of programming using both open hardware tools and industrial components such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, three phase motors and variable speed drives. The methodology aims to improve the algorithmic thinking in the students due to the deficiencies detected in it, as well as, it searches that the students learn a second programming language, using hands-on designs and activities that require the components mentioned. In addition, the methodology has been employed into the curriculum of a course of programming known as (open hardware) for students of technology in electronics (n=22), observing that the students learn programming concepts in a better way and their motivation and engagement towards the software area was increased during the course. To technical level, the methodology uses the programming language Python in order to interact with the different ports, peripherals and utilities of the platforms mentioned, creating a link between these elements and the aspects concerning the software design, e.g., data types, classes, methods or Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). Finally, the methodology takes into account two important aspects, firstly, the skills developed by the students in the proposal are involved into the BoK (Body of Knowledge) of different engineering areas as embedded systems, control and computer science and, secondly, programming is perhaps one of the most difficult areas in engineering but in turn, it has a ubiquitous nature in the areas mentioned.

We focus our work on designing a low cost dataglove using open source hardware and software. We run algorithms on the micro controller to interpret basic gestures and phrases. The interpretat ' results are sent wirelessly to a bluetooth enabled smartphone to be displayed on screen. We benchmark the interpretation accuracy on three different users. Our results show that most basic sign gestures can be interpreted rather accurately using only simple algorithms.

AB Tree fall is a major issue in large cities as it may obstruct roads and lead to traffic jams, and even injure people. Following these kind of incidents, monitoring the environment through sensors and Internet of Things technologies emerges as an important preventive approach. Another point is that the net primary productivity has a sensitive relation with trees characteristics including plant respiration and net photosynthesis which are highly sensitive to temperature. The health of the tree can then be monitored through leaf transpiration, sap flow measurement, environment evaluation as these methods offer indicators on any chance of a fall. The solution proposed in this paper includes an open-design hardware setup for monitoring trees in Smart Cities with Internet of Things. The setup is connected to a Smart City platform aiming to facilitate the use by other researchers and botanics, specially. Therefore, we noticed that the daily sensing data results in a huge amount of information that requires a balance between Big Data and Edge Computing approaches to process the whole collected data. The evaluation of the sensing data is presented together with the proposed architecture.

AB Computational methods for the enhancement of energy efficiency rely on a measurement process with sufficient accuracy and number of measurements. Networked energy meters, energy monitors, serve as vital link between energy consumption of households and key insights that reveal strategies to achieve significant energy savings. During the design of such an energy monitor, several aspects such as data update rate or variety of measured physical quantities have to be considered. This paper introduces YoMoPie, a user-oriented energy monitor based on the Raspberry Pi platform that aims to enable intelligent energy services in households. YoMoPie measures active as well as apparent power, stores data locally, and integrates an easy to use Python library. Furthermore, the presented energy monitor comes with a Python API enabling the execution of user-designed services to enhance energy efficiency in buildings and households. Along with the presented design, possible applications that could run on top of this system such as residential demand response, immediate user feedback, smart meter data analytics, or energy disaggregation are discussed. Finally, a case study is presented, which compares the measurement accuracy of YoMoPie to a certified energy analyser for a selection of common household appliances.

AB MANET (Mobile Ad Hoc Network) researchers have shown increased interest in using mobile robot technology for their testbed platforms. Thus, the main motivation of this paper is to review various robot-based MANET testbeds that have been developed in previously reported research. Additionally, suggestions to heighten mobility mechanisms by using mobile robots to be more practical, easy and inexpensive are also included in this paper, as we unveils ToMRobot, a low-cost MANET robot created from an ordinary remote control car that is capable of performing a real system MANET testbed with the addition of only a few low-cost electronic components. Despite greatly reduced costs, the ToMRobot does not sacrifice any of the necessary MANET basic structures and will still be easily customisable and upgradeable through the use of open hardware technology like Cubieboard2 and Arduino, as its robot controller. This paper will also include guidelines to enable technically limited MANET researchers to design and develop the ToMRobot. It is hoped that this paper achieves its two pronged objectives namely (i) to facilitate other MANET researchers by providing them with a source of reference that eases their decision making for selecting the best and most suitable MANET mobile robots for real mobility in their MANET testbeds (ii) to provide MANET researchers with a prospect of building their own MANET robots that can be applied in their own MANET testbed in the future.

AB Robotic automation is considered as the fourth industrial revolution by multiple industrialists. Robots are faster, more accurate, less error-prone and cost-effective when compared to human beings. For big companies, it is estimated that by 2025, labor cost savings from the adoption of advanced industrial robots would surpass 20%. However, for small and medium companies, industrial robots are still expensive and unaffordable. Fortunately, with the advent of Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence, open source hardware and software, and the declining price of electronic components, a new generation of smaller, cheaper and friendlier robots are emerging, for small and medium businesses. In this paper, we propose the simulation of an Indoor Positioning System (IPS) robot, which performs a forklift operation in a warehouse. The system uses Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology, and Java programming language for exchanging data from a server. An ESP8266 NodeMCU module, an Arduino microcontroller and various components such as MFRC522 to read RFID tags, Ultrasonic Sensors HC-SR04 for detecting obstacles are used. This resulted in a very low cost, reliable and multifunctional system. Simulations have demonstrated that the mobile robot can transmit packets over the network to a local server for mapping without losses. Moreover, it can receive packets from the server to obtain destination points and mapping obstacles while moving around the RFID tagged floor.

ID TEST PROGRAM GENERATION; VALIDATION
AB The complexity and heterogeneity of digital devices used in embedded systems is increasing everyday and delivering a bug-free design is still a very complex task. The interest for open-source hardware in real products is demanding for tools and advanced methodologies for verification to provide high reliability to open and free IPs. In this work, an open-source evolutionary optimizer has been used to create functional test programs that improve the verification test set for an open-source microprocessor, enhancing in this way, the verification level of the device. The verification programs are generated to optimize code coverage metrics and are tested against a high-level model to find device incorrectnesses during the generation time. A perturbation mechanism has been included in the verification framework to cover parts of the device under verification not reachable with only software stimuli such as interrupts or memory stalls. The proposed methodology uncovered 10 bugs still present in the RTL description of the analyzed device and demonstrated the effectiveness of open-source verification tools for the next generation of open-source RISC-V microprocessors.

AB The high cost associated with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) capable of operating beyond the mesopelagic ocean zone has prevented the extensive study of the deep ocean. Consequently, little is known about these regions deeper than 1000 m. However, science drivers like climate change, commercial applications like deep sea fisheries and underwater mining are pushing the need to know more about such areas. In this paper we present the development and design of an open source, low cost, autonomous underwater vehicle for optical mapping of the deep sea. With a length of under 1 m and a weight of approximately 20 kg it can operate in depths of up to 6000 m. The AUV has been designed making use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) parts and it is intended to be easily assembled without the need of complex tools. The vehicle has a total materials cost of under $30, 000 and we are distributing open source design files. We believe such a platform has the ability to increase deep ocean access to a broader community of researchers and engineers by lessing cost constraints.

AB Easy-to-use and affordable means of production (e.g. 3D printer), access to these technologies (e.g. in makerspaces) and powerful tools for online product design led to the emergence of open source hardware (OSH). Like in open source software, projects and online platforms have been evolving around physical products from various technologies where people jointly develop and freely share designs. We also find businesses that sell products made from these designs and offer complimentary services. This decentralized and collaborative model of value creation offers new opportunities for social, economic and ecological sustainability, but also calls for a different understanding beyond traditional notions. Results from an exploratory study on OSH projects and companies revealed that licensing is a critical issue, communities and partners play a key role in the open source ecosystem and modes of value creation are either centered around design or production in combination with a mix of complimentary services.

AB Long-range (LoRa) radio technologies have recently gained momentum in the IoT landscape, allowing low-power communications over distances up to several kilometers. As a result, more and more LoRa networks are being deployed. However, commercially available LoRa devices are expensive and propriety, creating a barrier to entry and possibly slowing down developments and deployments of novel applications. Using open-source hardware and software platforms would allow more developers to test and build intelligent devices resulting in a better overall development ecosystem, lower barriers to entry, and rapid growth in the number of IoT applications. Toward this goal, this paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of KRATOS, a low-cost LoRa platform running ContikiOS. Both, our hardware and software designs are released as an open source to the research community.

AB Computer Numerical Control is a technology made up of several blocks. The single most important of these blocks is the Control Unit, responsible for performing security checks, user interface, coordinating the motion, file handling and coordinating several peripherals usually used on CNC applications. Over the course of last years, embedded systems presented a huge improvement in processing power as well as easiness of use and application, given the advances in the open source and open hardware development community. The present paper presents the development process of a high-end embedded system based CNC controller, capable of operating including motion constraints up to the fourth order time derivative of position for each of the individual Cartesian axis.

AB Traditional manufacturing systems consist of devices with limited functionality and are constructed in a vertical structure. This is not suitable for smart factory environment where Internet of Things (IoT) is actively utilized and connected to external environment. Cyber Physical System (CPS), a key element of the Smart Factory, means that cyber and physical systems are tightly connected and intelligent. To build a CPS, IoT needs to be handled effectively, and stability and connectivity must be ensured. Therefore, the system in the Smart Factory is preferably built according to the loT standard. hi this paper, we propose an industrial device monitoring and control system based on oneM2M, and discuss that this system can be applied in a smart factory environment. The proposed system is based on Mobius, developed by Korea Electronics Technology Institute (KETI) as an open source IoT platform, and its components are open source hardware which is high performance with low cost. The Smart Factory system can be constructed in various forms using Mobius. In this paper, a model for its structure and utilization is presented.

AB A robotic platform is essential to validate any algorithm developed for mobile robotics research, as usually simulation results does not reflect all the real world circumstances and error sources. Nowadays there are several available commercial solutions that can be used to validate the developed algorithms, but they are usually expensive and closed to hardware modifications. Another option is to build the robotic platform, but while these solutions are normally open hardware and can be easily modified and maintained, many are assembled using low cost components and are intended only for robot education, and for this reason are not suitable for advanced algorithm implementation nor can employ advanced sensors. A possible solution is presented in this paper, in which an open hardware modular omnidirectional platform is developed, with robust hardware implementation using modular commercially available components, at a lower cost that some more expensive available solutions, but with similar performance and capabilities being suitable for mobile robot research and experimentation.

Because these keys can be stolen or hacked, we suggest to prevent these risks by using javacard secure elements. We detailed the interface of a Crypto Currency Smart Card (CCSC) designed over a JC3.04 standard platform. We details two use cases. First deals with deployment of the CCSC application in low cost low power object powered by an open hardware (arduino) platform, and integrates sensor data in ethereum transactions. Second proposes the deployment in the cloud of CCSC javacards plugged to RACS servers, in order to enable the remote and safe use of ECDSA signature.

For this device, we developed a sensoring system for capturing and recording the quadrotor odometry, an architecture to send the angular velocity commands to the motors via PWM, and the processing is made on a Raspberry Pi 3.

AB Soft wearable robots comprised of deformable materials have recently attracted much attention in the field of applications for its lightness and elasticity. However, there exist some limitation to the control of wearable robots due to the complexity of the model and the conditions of the wearer. In this paper, we propose a learning-based position control method of soft wearable glove using a deep neural network (DNN). To analyze our proposed method, we fabricated a soft pneumatic glove and a control board for the glove based on open hardware platform data. With our developed system, we collected the pressure and position data of the soft glove using a Leap Motion sensor to train our soft glove position network (SGPN). Along with our proposed DNN model, we could enable open-loop control on the joint positions of the soft glove by supplying pressure to the actuator without prior knowledge of the wearer or the wearable robot such as hand size of the wearer or the stiffness of pneumatic actuator.
