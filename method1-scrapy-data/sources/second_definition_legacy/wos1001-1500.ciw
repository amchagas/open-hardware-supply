AB With over a decade of intensive research and development, wireless sensor network (WSN) technology has been emerging as a feasible solution to many innovative applications. In this paper, we describe a wireless sensor network system that we have developed using open-source hardware platforms, Raspberry Pi and zigbee. The system is low-cost, low power consuming and highly scalable both in terms of the type of sensors and the number of sensor nodes, which makes it well suited for a wide variety of applications related to environmental monitoring. Raspberry Pi is cheap, flexible, fully customizable and programmable small computer embedded linux board and abilities of its usage as WSN node and sensor node. Raspberry Pi works as a base station which connects the sensor nodes via zigbee protocol in the wireless sensor network and collects sensors data from different sensors, and supply multi-clients services including data display. The client can visit the base station remotely via (website) Ethernet or command console.

AB One of the problems faced by people living in cities is lack of time. Many people have gardens in their homes. Maintenance of these gardens is tedious and time consuming task. The main aim is to implement a cost effective automated gardening system. This system helps in solving the above problem by being efficient and using fewer resources. The system uses low cost efficient soil moisture, light and temperature sensors to decide when and how much water will be provided to the potted plants. Programming languages like embedded C and python is used to configure the microcontroller. The data would be displayed through a GUI created using processing. The user will also be able to control the entire system remotely as well as monitor the sensor readings.

AB In the last decades drop-on-demand inkjet technology played an increasing role in industrial and medical applications. This is due to the ability to deposit a small amount of material in precisely defined position. In the field of Biofabrication, inkjet printers are used to build 2D and 3D scaffolds and gels with biological molecules, including living cells. Several works, including seminal papers on inkjet bioprinting, were carried out with modified office printers. These printers have fixed structural characteristics and operating size, especially on the print-head, limiting the range of materials that can be dispensed. The aim of the present work is the design and fabrication of an open-source piezoelectric inkjet print-head, optimized for the bioprinting field. This low-cost, reproducible, reliable, versatile and biocompatible device will enable various research laboratories to work with a shared device; the open source allowing for parts to be modified to suit specific needs. The design was carried out by Finite Element (FE) modelling of the piezoelectric, mechanical, fluid dynamics and their coupling. The design was optimized for shear rate, which we minimized in order to be able to print cells. The mechanical frame of the printer was designed and built using a low-cost 3D printer. The nozzle plate was fabricated from a polycarbonate disc coated with biocompatible silicone, to increase the hydrophobicity of the outer surface of the disc, preventing ink adhesion on the edge of the nozzle; the refilling system, and the electronic control were also part of the project and will be freely available to download. The FE models were validated with ad-hoc experiments, printing water, gelatin solution, and cell culture media, by modulating the wave power in amplitude, frequency and duty cycle. The tests showed a large working window both respect to viscosity and to surface tension. Finally Human Skin Fibroblasts (ATCC-CRL-2522, Teddington UK), suspended in culture media, were printed. Cell viability, assessed by CellTiter-Blue and LIVE / DEAD tests, resulted comparable with the control, demonstrating the validity of the first open source piezoelectric inkjet print-head for biofabrication.

AB Decision making of a vertebrate in response to the sensory signals from the environment is regulated by the neuromodulatory systems in its brain. A vertebrate's behaviors like focusing attention, cautious risk-aversion and curiosity seeking exploration are influenced by these neuromodulatory. The paper presents an autonomous robotic control approach based on vertebrate neuromodulation and its implementation on multiple open-source hardware platforms. A simple neural network is used to model the neuromodulatory functions for generating context based behavioral responses to sensory signals. The neural network incorporates three types of neurons- attention focusing cholinergic and noradrenergic (ACh/NE), curiosity-seeking dopaminergic (DA), and risk aversive serotonergic (5-HT) neurons. The implementation of the neuronal model on multiple relatively simple autonomous robots is illustrated through the interesting behavior of the robots adapting to changes in the environment. The implementation is done in open-source, open-access robotics software framework of Robot Operating System (ROS).

AB A very serious problem has been identified for past many years that paralyzed human beings became isolated from the society for not having a proper existence and due to their reluctances of doing normal life works. Therefore, we have researched on the Human Machine Interaction using Physical Human Body Gestures and came up to proposed solution of the said issue as Low Cost Retina Controlled Computer Using Head mount and Wrist Tilt for Persons who are Paralyzed and cannot be able to move their hands and even they can't able to walk. Conventionally, we named it as simple as Retina Controlled Computer, is based on Google Glass vision using motion recognition, Zigbee Wireless Technology, Retina Controlled Device that allows human beings with paralysis resulting from Paralysis to do everything on computer even controlling the personal mobile phone using only their Eye and Head movements. This whole project will be based mainly on the new technology of Low Cost Wireless Zigbee Sensors, Arduino Microcontrollers, and motion and retina recognition using Accelerometer. Arduino Microcontroller consists of an open-source hardware board designed around an 8-bit Atmel AVR microcontroller, or a 32-bit Atmel ARM. Therefore, making an Intelligent Low Cost Eye Controlled Computer, based on new technologies will play a vital role in revolutionizing the field of Biomedical engineering and opening the new horizons of research.

AB Engineering education, in the field of Computer science and Information technology, has the greatest challenges today. These challenges are shaped by the rapid growth of communication systems usage and the appearance of new technologies. Currently, there is a variety of emerging technologies such as: Bluetooth Low Energy, IEEE 802.15.4, ZigBee, 6lowWPAN, etc. In order to enable easy and fast implementation of these technologies in University courses, the building of the low-cost, flexible and scalable platform with support of these technologies is required. This paper presents an approach in building the platform for teaching communication systems and related topics based on open source hardware. The experience with this platform is presented as well.

AB A plenitude of technology is neither developed in-house nor simply outsourced in dyadic relationships. Instead, we are in a new age where technologies are developed by a networked community of actors and organizations, which base their relations dynamically to each other on a common interest. Such dynamic and networked complexity of technology development is often theoretical explored around the concept of platform, and more recently by employing the concept of ecosystem in an analogy to natural ecosystems. Following the success of open-source software, academics have long been examining openness in digital platforms/ecosystems; however most contributions take the perspective of a single stakeholder from the many that constitute a digital platform/ecosystem. Predominantly, they take the sole perspective of platform providers, those bundling hardware and software or more rarely, the perspective of third-party software developers developing valuable software 'apps' that add value to the overall platform. In this conceptual article, we grasp openness more holistically, both by acknowledging that openness means different things to different people and involve all stakeholders within the platforms/ecosystems. Towards the development of a theory of openness within digital settings, we propose six novel aspects of openness for enabling a greater understanding of the open-source software movement with a digital platforms/ecosystems perspective. Moreover, we invite scholars to reconsider the more predominating product-dominant logic in open-source software research to a more holistic logic embracing platforms and ecosystem thinking.

AB The design of sensing systems powered from energy harvesting can be complex. Design decisions are required concerning the properties and parameters of energy harvesting, conversion, and storage devices. The quantity and properties of environmental energy are typically both temporally and spatially variant, while the current consumption of the load electronics also changes dynamically. In this paper we describe Enspect, an open-source hardware/software tool which simplifies the design of energy harvesting sensing systems by assisting in the specification of harvesting and storage devices. It does this by enabling the long-term collection of data on energy availability, and modeling and simulating the performance of a complete system.

AB In this paper is presented approach in planning the deployment of 868 MHz RF modules in Wireless Sensor Networks scenarios. This approach covers the site-general ITU propagation model calculation compared with the real field measurement made with open-source hardware platform based on Arduino UNO and RFBee communication modules. The field measurements are made in institutional building in order to find effective way to predict best positions for wireless sensor stations in Wireless Sensor Network. The Arduino is used to make effective and low-cost platform for experiments. The RF 868 MHz modules are used in order to avoid 2.4 GHz frequency range with lot of interference. In this paper is presented the platform, test conditions, measurement results and the discussion about the achieved results with focus on the tuning of the ITU loss propagation model for the best planning of node deployment in the given scenario.

AB Technological devices of all kinds are becoming more common in our daily lives: smart devices are being incorporated in buildings, houses, cars, and public infrastructure such as roads and bridges. The new devices give us an unusual degree of connectivity in our regular activities, for example when we employ our tablets or smart phones to check email or browse the public network, but also in more innovative forms of connectivity, such as receiving notifications directly from our refrigerator or collecting information from our clothes and shoes. This technological revolution brings new opportunities and challenges for users, businesses, and society. This paper explores such a new context, where we begin to co-exist and interact with a network of interconnected devices that is known as the Internet of Things. The objective of the project is to implement a solution for communicating devices that monitor, in real-time, the structural health of a bridge. The implementation is based on 6LoWPAN, a standard based on the IPv6 protocol over low-power and lossy networks to support the Internet of Things. We employ open hardware platforms and emphasize the singularities of embedded systems, such as a limited number of operations, low power consumption, and low bandwidth capability. The prototype shown in this work uses the 6LoWPAN standard in a network environment that connects with a real Bridge Management System, with the aim of optimizing the maintenance of road structures.

AB Colorimetry based point-of-care diagnostics provide an inexpensive technique for healthcare and environmental monitoring during disaster relief operations. Conventional equipments for measuring colorimetric assays are bulky and expensive, making them unsuitable for usage in low-resource settings. This paper proposes a novel approach for taking colorimetric measurements using a miniaturized spectrophotometer prototype attached to a smartphone. The proposed frugal design is portable, easy-to-use and costs less than US$15. High dynamic range imaging is used to process the spectrums captured by smartphone camera. The proposed algorithm supports JPEG image format, allowing the prototype to be used with a wide variety of smartphone models. In the experimental study, spectrums of color dye and milk samples are imaged. Spectrums obtained are found to be well correlated with the sample color and concentration. By providing accurate and fast measurements, smartphone spectrophotometry enables effective application of colorimetric diagnostic techniques in low-resource settings.

AB In this paper we investigate if a technology enhanced learning environment for engineering design competencies can promote transfer of these competencies. We developed TELE-EDesC, a self-learning technology enhanced learning environment to teach Structure Open Problem competency, one of the first competencies used in the engineering design thinking process. TELE-EDesC contains learning activities and instructional scaffolds that have been known to promote transfer. In this study, students worked with TELE-EDesC learning activities in the topic of analog electronics. The two-part study investigated if: i) students can acquire Structure Open Problem competencies by learning with TELE-EDesC, and ii) the TELE-EDesC ( experimental group) students can transfer these competencies by structuring a new open design problem in a new topic in analog electronics. Analysis of students' solutions demonstrated that students who learnt with TELE-EDesC scored higher on a posttest that measured Structure Open Problem competencies than students in a control group. Further, TELE-EDesC helped students transfer some competencies to the new topic, but they struggled to transfer competencies involving higher order cognitive skills.

AB Today, Infonnation and Communication Technology (ICT) is ubiquitous. It has touched almost all spheres concerning human survival, growth and development. Agriculture is no exception to it. This paper presents the research initiatives towards improving irrigation efficiency through affordable ICT solutions. It presents experimental results of studies related to improving irrigation efficiency in Semi arid zones in India, using commercially available ICT solutions. It compares between simple microirrigation and microirrigation with ICT (irrigation on demand) and establishes that by using ICT in agriculture, we can increase the irrigation efficiencies by a considerable amount. The paper also presents the development of indigenous wireless sensor node and gateway made from open source hardware and software components. The efforts in this regard show, while maintaining comparable performance, a significant reduction in the cost of wireless sensor devices, when compared to commercially available wireless sensor devices, is achieved.

AB Performance improvements of a single-core processor relying on high clock rates reached the limit. Instead of a single-core processor, multi-core and many-core processors have been mainstream to accelerate applications by parallel processing. Year by year, the number of cores integrated in a single chip has been increased due to improvements of semiconductor integration technologies depending on Moore's Law. On the other hand, Moore's Law will be ended in the near future. This means that the approaches relying on the increase in the number of cores will be hopeless, thus we have to consider other effective ways. One of them is to design application specific hardware. Several research organizations have explored it and reported its remarkable findings. We focus on such an acceleration approach with dedicated hardware.
   As a case study with dedicated hardware, we present a sorting acceleration method. Sorting is an extremely important computation kernel that should be accelerated in a lot of fields, such as databases, image processing, data compression, etc. We propose a sorting accelerator combining Sorting Network and Merge Sorter Tree, and detail the design and implementation. Our proposed sorting accelerator is customizable, thus designers can implement a sorting accelerator composed of required hardware resources by means of tuning design parameters. Our experiments show that the proposed hardware achieves up to 10.06x sorting performance, compared with Intel Core i7-4770 operating at 3.4GHz, when sorting 256M 32-bits integer elements. In order to allow every designer to easily and freely use this accelerator, the RTL source code is released as an open-source hardware.

It is intended to improve the teaching of these concepts by providing a platform that is more open and understandable and by lowering the economic barriers to students interested in the field.
   To do this, the Lab-In-A-Box brings a full powered Digital Signal Processor (DSP) core to the popular Arduino microcontroller environment and marries it with a simple to use analog front end (AFE). The software platform provided with the Lab-In-A-Box includes an Arduino-like development environment that facilitates learning and quick development of signal processing applications without abstracting away the intricacies of a practical implementation. This system has been used to create several teaching examples and has been tested in courses at Stanford University.

AB Competitive solutions to the growing demand for home automation will most likely include the use of low cost components, open source and open hardware. Using the ZigBee protocol, a low cost lighting control actuator was developed that was battery efficient and easy to use in a home automation system environment. Raspberry Pi was used to house a Web server, which provided the user an adaptive web application to access the lighting actuator control. XBee modules were chosen for their small size, low energy consumption and the large amount of documentation that exists in regard to its use. Considering the worst-case scenario, the lighting control actuator was designed so if its battery runs out of power or the ZigBee network fails, it can work as a normal light switch.

AB This paper introduces OpenMote, the latest generation of Berkeley motes. OpenMote is a open-hardware prototyping ecosystem designed to accelerate the development of the Industrial Internet of Things ( IIoT). It features the OpenMote-CC2538, a state-of-the-art computing and communication device. This device interfaces with several other accessories, or "skins", through a standardized connector. The skins developed to date include boards to provide power, boards which enable a developer to easily debug the platform, and boards to allow seamless integration of an OpenMote network into the Internet.
   This hardware ecosystem is complemented by a suite of software tools and ports to popular open-source IoT implementations. The OpenMote platform is for example tailored to run the OpenWSN open-source implementation of emerging IIoT standards. The combination of hardware and software ecosystems gives an embedded programmer an intuitive and complete development environment, and an end-user a fully working low-power wireless mesh networking solution running the latest IIoT standards.

AB Principles of openness and collaboration that catalyze open-source software innovation have also been successfully transferred into the world of hardware [1]. Advances in open-source hardware allow students, researchers and hobbyists to custom build devices for a wide variety of purposes. Open-source prototyping platforms like Arduino and Raspberry Pi empower people to build cheap, modular, and easy to use alternatives to expensive commercial grade scientific equipment. The authors argue that the use of open-source hardware in building neuroIS research tools will dramatically decrease the costs and complexity associated with research in university laboratories. In this work, we discuss the use of open-source hardware in neuroIS research. We present the design of a neuroIS research tool based on BITalino, a biosignal capturing and processing platform. We also present a novel prototype that is specifically tuned toward neuroIS research using the API provided by the creators of BITalino.

AB This paper suggests that Mass-Individualization, which is based on a consumer product that consists of an open hardware platform and multiple modules that are interfaced with the platform, will constitute the next paradigm in product design. Customers will be able to adapt the open platform to their needs by integrating modules of their choice into the platform, thereby constructing individual products that fit their exact needs. Large manufacturers will produce the platforms, and small companies will invent and produce modules that could be interfaced with the open-platform products. Smartphones is an example of an open-platform product, and the Apps that are designed to run on smartphones are examples for modules. Each customer downloads certain Apps that fit his/her needs, thereby creating an individual smartphone. The Apps, however, are software modules. The modules that are considered in this paper are hardware modules. Open-platform products will create a new paradigm in product design and utilization that we call the Mass-Individualization paradigm. The Mass-Individualization paradigm will boost the economy by (1) creating many new jobs in module production companies and (2) increasing the level of sales of consumer products.

AB This paper presents a design for a low-cost research robot based on the chassis of a Hexbug Spider, a remote controlled toy robot. Our modification replaces the robot head with a 3d printed adapter part which provides space for sensors, a larger battery, and a microcontroller board. In a second part of the paper we address the manufacturing process of such a robot. The presented robot costs far less than 100 Euro and is suitable for swarm robotic experiments. The hexapod locomotion makes the robot attractive for applications where a two wheel differential drive cannot be used. Our modification is published as open hardware and open source to allow further customizations.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is a rapidly expanding space for researchers, students, and professionals. Development of IoT applications is hindered by the lack of available design tools, methodologies, and interoperability. The creation of a standards-based, open source hardware and software platform paired with full documentation and educational materials greatly aids in the accelerated development of IoT applications and provides a fertile ground for Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) educational opportunities.

AB Computational models are mathematical representations meant to replicate the biological system they represent, as well as provide insights and predict the system's dynamics in response to changing conditions. In a bottom-up modeling approach, a multitude of models may be compounded to represent more complex higher level biological systems. However, guaranteeing the validity and predictability of the compounded ensemble may become increasingly challenging as more components are integrated. We herein present a sequential and iterative method to maximize predictability of a complex multiscale model. We have successfully developed a multiscale modeling platform comprised of mechanisms ranging from the biomolecular level to multi-cellular networks. To maintain a high level of predictability of the global platform, we introduce a systematic approach to not only validate all models independently, but also verify the validity of compounded models as additional information becomes available at higher levels of complexity. Iterative and systematic application of these validation steps at increasing levels of complexity is intended to maximize the predictive power of the platform, making it a powerful tool to study the impacts of low-levels modifications (pathologies, drugs, etc.) on higher functional levels. The work presented lays down the rationale of the approach, the open design implementation and results.

AB The number and complexity of control systems in wind turbines (WT) is expanding rapidly, and their design can be the difference between an immensely profitable system or a damaged system. Designing a robust control system requires to test the control algorithms in the actual controller hardware. However, WT are large and expensive, thus we would like to perform this test virtually, without using prototypes of the WT. This work develops a fault diagnosis (FD) and fault tolerant control (FTC) of pitch actuators in wind turbines. This is accomplished by combining a disturbance compensator with a controller, both of which are formulated in the discrete-time domain. The disturbance compensator has a dual purpose: to reconstruct the actuator fault (which is used by the FD technique) and to design the discrete-time controller to obtain a FTC. That is, the actuator faults are reconstructed and then the control inputs are modified to achieve a FTC with a comparable behavior to the fault-free case. The performance of the FD and FTC schemes is tested in a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) testbed for WT controllers. The used controller hardware is an open hardware Arduino board which is connected to the virtual WT via USB. The onshore 5MW turbine is simulated on the open-source National Renewable Energy Laboratory WT simulator FAST (Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structures, and Turbulence). The proposed HiL is used to characterize the behavior of the WT in the full load region in normal operation as well as under fault operation.

AB Background: The effects of creatine on brain metabolism and the potential cognitive enhancing-properties of this compound raise the possibility of developinga new augmentation therapeutic strategy in schizophrenia especially in patients demonstrating negative and cognitive symptomatology
   Methods: Seven inpatients with chronic schizophrenia presenting with treatment resistant negative symptoms were enrolled into exploratory treatment study with creatine monohydrate augmentation at a daily high-dose of 10 grams, administered for 6 months. Several clinical rating, scales and a computerized: cognitive assessment battery were applied
   Results: Creatine treatment mildly improved the schizophrenia symptomatology but there were no significant changes in cognitive functions. Several ward behaviors were also improved. Tardive parkinsonism improved numerically by above 40% in 4 out of 6 patients.
   Conclusion: This small, open design study of high dose creatine add-on for 6 months in chronic inpatients with schizophrenia demonstrated only mild positive effects on the patients' symptomatology and behavior and might have beneficial effect on tardive parkinsonism.

DE Stand-Up Forklift Truck; Emergency Egress Time; Occupant Compartment;
   Door
AB A significant hazard related to the use of stand-up lift trucks, or stand-up forklifts, is the hazard of a lower limb crush injury or foot crush due to the opening across the rear of the operator compartment. According to one lift truck manufacturer's statistics, there have been over 500 accidents that resulted in an injury to the lower limb of the operator in the last 30 years that involved their stand-up lift trucks. [1] Other manufacturers have had similar accidents. The injuries have occurred to the lower limb of the operator due to the close proximity of the operator's lower limbs to the exterior of the lift truck, and the confined areas that stand-up lift trucks operate in. The operator's lower limb can become pinned and crushed between the moving lift and another fixed object such as a rack system, a column or another lift truck. Objects, such as a fork tine, can also intrude into the operator compartment, injuring the operator's lower extremities.
   The ANSI/ITSDF B56.1, Safety Standard for Low Lift and High Lift Trucks, encourages stand-up lift trucks to be designed with an open compartment to permit easy ingress and egress. [2] According to the standard, the open design allows an operator a free and easy egress from the truck in the event of a tip-over or off-the-dock accident. However, the standard permits the use of additional guarding and enclosure of the operator compartment. Spring loaded doors (or spring assisted closing guards) have been designed, implemented and are available from many manufacturers, but no data has been published regarding the time to open and egress from the operator compartment. Latching doors have also been designed and manufactured, but are not currently available on the market except in the case of trucks equipped with freezer cabs, for operation in refrigerated environments. However, latched doors have been criticized for extending the egress time duration by approximately 1/2 second.
   This study shows that a spring loaded door can be implemented on a stand-up forklift while only increasing egress time by a negligible amount, 0.05 seconds over an open compartment configuration. Furthermore, this study shows that an optimized latching door, designed by Knott Laboratory engineers, can also be implemented for a stand-up forklift while only increasing egress time by 0.09 seconds. The latching door designed by Knott Laboratory decreases the change in egress time associated with a latched door by a factor of 5. Therefore, the addition of a spring loaded door, or a latching door will not significantly increase operator egress time and provide additional protection to the operator in the event of a collision while still maintaining quick egress.

AB The Open Compute Project, OCP (http://www.opencompute.org/), was launched by Facebook in 2011 with the objective of building efficient computing infrastructures at the lowest possible cost. The technologies are released as open hardware, with the goal to develop servers and data centres following the model traditionally associated with open source software projects. In 2013 CERN acquired a few OCP servers in order to compare performance and power consumption with standard hardware. The conclusions were that there are sufficient savings to motivate an attempt to procure a large scale installation. One objective is to evaluate if the OCP market is sufficiently mature and broad enough to meet the constraints of a public procurement. This paper summarizes this procurement, which started in September 2014 and involved the Request for information (RFI) to qualify bidders and Request for Tender (RFT).

AB BACKGROUND: The new technology ensures 3D laparoscopic vision by adding depth to the traditional two dimensions. This realistic vision gives the surgeon the feeling of operating in real space. Hospital of Treviglio-Caravaggio isn't an university or scientific institution; in 2014 a new 3D laparoscopic technology was acquired therefore it led to evaluation of the of the appropriateness in term of patient outcome and safety. The project aims at achieving the development of a quantitative validation model that would ensure low cost and a reliable measure of the performance of 3D technology versus 2D mode. In addition, it aims at demonstrating how new technologies, such as open source hardware and software and 3D printing, could help research with no significant cost increase. For these reasons, in order to define criteria of appropriateness in the use of 3D technologies, it was decided to perform a study to technically validate the use of the best technology in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and safety in the use of a system between laparoscopic vision in 3D and the traditional 2D.
   METHODS: 30 surgeons were enrolled in order to perform an exercise through the use of laparoscopic forceps inside a trainer. The exercise consisted of having surgeons with different level of seniority, grouped by type of specialization (eg. surgery, urology, gynecology), exercising videolaparoscopy with two technologies (2D and 3D) through the use of a anthropometric phantom. The target assigned to the surgeon was that to pass "needle and thread" without touching the metal part in the shortest time possible. The rings selected for the exercise had each a coefficient of difficulty determined by depth, diameter, angle from the positioning and from the point of view.
   RESULTS: The analysis of the data collected from the above exercise has mathematically confirmed that the 3D technique ensures a learning curve lower in novice and greater accuracy in the performance of the task with respect to 2D.

AB Despite the rapid change in cellular technologies, Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) keep a high percentage of their deployed infrastructure using Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) technologies. With about 3.5 billion subscribers, GSM remains as the de facto standard for cellular communications. However, the security criteria envisioned 30 years ago, when the standard was designed, are no longer sufficient to ensure the security and privacy of the users. Furthermore, even with the newest fourth generation (4G) cellular technologies starting to be deployed, these networks could never achieve strong security guarantees because the MNOs keep backwards-compatibility given the huge amount of GSM subscribers. In this paper, we present and describe the tools and necessary steps to perform an active attack against a GSM-compatible network, by exploiting the GSM protocol lack of mutual authentication between the subscribers and the network. The attack consists of a so-called man-in-the-middle attack implementation. By using Software Defined Radio (SDR), open-source libraries and open-source hardware, we setup a fake GSM base station to impersonate the network and therefore eavesdrop any communications that are being routed through it and extract information from their victims. Finally, we point out some implications of the protocol vulnerabilities and how these can not be mitigated in the short term since 4G deployments will take long time to entirely replace the current GSM infrastructure.

AB This paper describes the adoption of an open source hardware release process for a wearable headlamp as a way to improve prototyping and promote regionally-appropriate technology. The headlamp has been developed to satisfy a communicated need for hands-free, directional lighting that can he charged with renewable energy technology in remote areas that lack reliable electricity. The design of the headlamp emphasizes the importance of built-in resilience as way to achieve durability. Utilizing a highly-adaptable mechanical design accompanied with guiding design principles enables the headlamp to he implemented in an unlimited number of locations; during manufacture, the product will be embedded with locally-appropriate features that complement the materials and skills available in the region. Releasing the product with an open source hardware license fosters product adaptation for the design, manufacture, and use of the headlamp in various locations. Working prototypes have been developed, and kits are available under the IEEE open-source hardware license.

ID DESIGN
AB In this paper we present an open-source design for the development of low-complexity, anthropomorphic, underactuated robot hands with a selectively lockable differential mechanism. The differential mechanism used is a variation of the whiffletree (or seesaw) mechanism, which introduces a set of locking buttons that can block the motion of each finger. The proposed design is unique since with a single motor and the proposed differential mechanism the user is able to control each finger independently and switch between different grasping postures in an intuitive manner. Anthropomorphism of robot structure and motion is achieved by employing in the design process an index of anthropomorphism. The proposed robot hands can be easily fabricated using low-cost, off-the-shelf materials and rapid prototyping techniques. The efficacy of the proposed design is validated through different experimental paradigms involving grasping of everyday life objects and execution of daily life activities. The proposed hands can be used as affordable prostheses, helping amputees regain their lost dexterity.

AB Drones are a dark technology (Lichty). The military drones that kill civilians are unevenly distributed, geographically. The video "Our Drone Future" (Cornell) imagines a scenario where UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), with their technologies and capabilities, come to be pervasive in the skies of our future cities. The panoptic vision of the drone is a fundamental part of contemporary "complex of visuality" defined by the military-industrial complex, according to Mirzoeff. He proposes "the right to look" as a form of opposition to this alliance of visuality and power. The right to look from the skies as a practice of contravisuality using drones is claimed and exercised by an increasing number of hackers, artivists, social scientists, independent journalists and environmental activists, such as Mark Devries (FarmDrones) or Lot Amoros (Guerilla Drone, Flone). In order to investigate and act in the present on "Our future drone", we propose the creation of a citizen laboratory and a learning community in the use of UAVs as social technology. Drone Hackademy joined for a week ten representatives of collectives from Rio de Janeiro and other Brazilian cities. Participants were teached how and why to protect themselves from UAVs. Activities included the construction of free hardware and software UAVs such as Flone; and the production of an aerial mapping of the local community resisting eviction in the area annex to the Olympic Park.

ID ERROR-CORRECTION
AB Building a quantum computer that is sufficiently large for solving classically intractable computational problem instances is a grand challenge of today's science. The main fundamental obstacle to construction of scalable quantum computers is the vulnerability of their extremely fragile components to noise and decoherence due to environment interaction. This paper focuses on design of technology-independent quantum circuit architectures that are scalable and reliable as well as well-suited for physical implementation. The considered architectures will be protected against errors by state-of-the-art topological quantum error-correcting (TQEC) codes which combine a number of properties enabling the best scalability among all discussed alternatives. The theory of TQEC is very mature, the suitable hardware has made significant progress in recent years, and therefore the software challenges constitute the research gaps. We explain the abstraction levels which lay the foundation for systematic, top-down design automation methods for TQEC computers, discuss the appropriate optimization objectives and formulate a number of largely open design automation problems in this fields.

ID GENERATION; STORIES
AB We introduce a research framework for the design of interactive experiences in the domain of emergent narrative, an application area of computational narrative in which stories emerge bottom-up from the behavior of autonomous characters in a simulated storyworld. Prior work in this area has largely concerned the development and tuning of the simulations themselves from which interesting stories may reliably emerge, but this approach will not necessarily improve system performance at its most crucial level-the actual interactive experience. Looking to completed experiences, namely simulation games like Dwarf Fortress and The Sims, we identify a series of shortcomings that yield four design challenges at the level of interaction: modular content, compositional representational strategies, story recognition, and story support. In this paper, we motivate and discuss each of these design challenges and, for each, summarize prior work and propose new approaches that future work might take.

AB The secure boot-up and setup of Internet of Things (IoT) devices connected over the Cloud represent a challenging open issue. This paper deals with the automatic configuration of IoT devices in a secure way through the Cloud, in order to provide new added-value services. After a discussion on the limits of current IoT and Cloud solutions in terms of secure self-configuration, we present a Cloud-based architecture that allows IoT devices to interact with several federated Cloud providers. In particular, we present two possible scenarios, that is, single Cloud and a federated Cloud environments, interacting with IoT devices and we address specific issues of both. Moreover, we present several design highlights on how to operate considering real open hardware and software products already available in the market.

AB Fabrication of medical devices using 3D-printing (3DP) technology can reduce the lack of adequate supply of medical devices in low-resource hospitals. Similar to Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), 3DP facilities can be established with a low start-up cost and they can leverage the support of existent open-source community. This paper highlights how ICTs implementations have been successful in addressing information management issues in low-resource healthcare setting and from there argues how 3DP can offer similar advantages by providing low-cost medical devices. Three main case studies of 3DP applications are explained in-depth.

DE Participatory design; Open Source Design; Design management
AB The open source design (OSD) is an autonomous community dedicated to design new products, peer-to-peer, and with intellectual property copyleft. Boundary Objects (BOs) are objects to aid on the collaboration and they are used as mediators between the proposals and the repertory of each team member. This concept is consolidated on the tangible world of participatory design, but what about the digital world? How the BO had been used in Open Source Design Communities? This study aimed to investigate this aspect in a specific community named Open Source Ecology (OSE). An exploratory research was realized to identify the OSE Design Phases and the main types of boundary objects used, as well the limitations of their utilization. The results identify a gap: the members of OSE indicate low usage of Boundary Objects but considered them as essential for collaboration. The low usage was justified by complexity. The creation of prototypes or mock-ups would require more design skills than is possible for regular user; finally, the study demonstrates an indication that the proposition and use of specific BOs for OSE is a theme that must be addressed by the design management community.

AB Literature presents a huge number of studies related with the design process, but the open source design may present an environment fundamentally different. The involvement of a large number of people self-organized in the design process may generate some negative effects. Therefore, there is a necessity of better understanding of the open source design process and the tools that aid this process management. The objective of this paper is to increase the understanding on open source design and identifies research questions in this field. In order to achieve the proposed objective was realized an ethnographic case study in a non-profit organization called Open Source Ecology (OSE), which included an extensive document analysis added to about 800 hours of participant observation over a period of three months. We identified some big challenges faced by OSE regarding the design process, community, platform and business, which were deployed in some open research questions. Our findings indicate that, even though many accomplishments have been achieved, the open source design movement still has a low level of maturity, and is far from showing its full potential.

ID INNOVATION
AB The frugal innovation approach takes place in developing countries to develop simple but essential products for low-income population. This approach asks for careful trade-offs to target a just-enough between cost reduction and essential value of the product.
   In this paper, we aim at understanding how the essential value of a product is defined during early design phases, and how it guides the "just-enough" between affordability and performance. Our study of five frugal products in India shows three strategies that define differently the essential values and their associated just-enough: design by aggregation, design by extension, and design by focalization. Design by focalization seems to answer frugal design issues, as it isolates the essential value in order to reduce drastically the overall cost. The introduction of the concept of Non-Trade-Offs (NTO), meaning the non-negotiable elements that guide design choices, helps understanding how to separate this essential value from additional functionalities. Our study gives new directions for both practionners and researchers towards a design for essential value, in developing countries but also in westerns countries.

ID PARTICIPATION; BUSINESS
AB Traditionally, the protection of intellectual property is regarded as a precondition for value capture. The rise of open source (OS) software and OS tangible products, so-called open design, has challenged this understanding. Openness is often regarded as a dichotomous variable (open-source vs. closed-source) and it is assumed that online developer communities demand full opening of the product's source. In this paper we will explore openness as a gradual and multi-dimensional concept. We carried out an Internet survey (N = 270) among participants of 20 open design communities in the domain of IT hardware and consumer electronics. We find that open design projects pursue complex strategies short of complete openness and that communities value openness of software more highly than openness of hardware. Our findings suggest that open design companies can successfully implement strategies of partial openness to safeguard value capture without alienating their developer community.

AB This paper puts forward six aspects in accordance to the perspective of home textile products design which includes the abstract thinking, personalized exaggerated pattern, the theme style of childhood, epidemic home textile fabrics, the process design and the use of color. By analyzing the design ideas of home textile products, we come to the conclusion that home textile designers should grasp the direction of design and the technique of expression, and excavate potential design inspiration. At the same time, it is designers' duty to make the home textile enterprise bigger, better and stronger with modern design concept. Through the changes mentioned above, home textile products will have a huge possibility to occupy the world textile stage with unique culture grade and design vision. Also it can improve the application level of home textile products design and provide a more open design thinking and cultural aesthetic level, so as to increase the market share of home textile products.

AB The great usefulness of remote recording of biomedical signals in most aspects of daily life has generated an increasing interest in this field. Traditionally, monitoring devices from clinical enviroments are bulky, intrusive, and expensive. Thus, the development of wearable, mobile, and low-cost applications is desirable. Nevertheless, recent improvements in open-hardware allow developing low cost devices and portable designs for biosignal monitoring in out-of-lab applications, such as sports, leisure, e-Health, etc. This paper presents a low-cost wearable system able to simultaneously record electrical brain and heart activity (i.e. electroencephalography and electrocardiography). The system is able to send biomedical data to a platform for remote analyses. Both software and hardware are open-source. We assessed the system for its validity and reliability in a real road environment.

AB The AMC FMC Carrier Kintex (AFCK) board is a prototype of Data Processing Board (DPB) for CBM experiment. AFCK is open hardware and was designed to be a verstaile solution, applicable in multiple systems. In CBM experiment AFCK will serve as a data hub and communication interconnection. One of DPB's functions is synchronization of Front End Electronics (FEE). To provide this functionality, it is necessary to receive the reference clock and timing signals from the Timing and Flow Control system. The received clock after the jitter cleaning will be used as a reference clock for GBT-FPGA based 4.8 Gbps links used for communication with front end electronics. This article will briefly describe AFCK board funcion in CBM experiment. Afterwards it will focus on jitter cleaning technique based on White Rabbit solution that can be used on AFCK board.

DT Article; Book Chapter
ID DESIGN TECHNIQUES
AB Neuromorphic chips often require a wide range of biasing currents which are independent of process and supply voltage, and which change with temperature appropriately to result in constant transconductance. These currents can span many decades, down to less than the transistor 'off-current'. This chapter describes how to design wide-dynamic range configurable bias current references. The output of each current reference is a gate voltage which produces a desired current. Bias currents are generated by a bootstrapped-mirror 'master bias' current reference that generates a master current, which is successively divided by a digitally-controlled current splitter to generate the desired reference currents. Nonidealities such as power supply sensitivity, matching, stability, and headroom are also discussed. Open source design kits simplify the job of including these circuits on new designs.

AB Sustainable manufacturing pursues various approaches, one of them is value creation through social innovations from open source innovations, respectively open design strategies. Well-known names such as "Local Motors" are a prime example for its success. But there are also concepts, which limit the sustainability of this success and can, consequently, lead to failure. Thus, it requires more than an analysis of successful projects to discover successful approaches. The reasons for the failure of other approaches are crucial. Based on the principle of "Survivorship Bias", success is more visible than failure. This inevitably leads to an overestimation of the prospects of success. For this purpose, different concepts were analyzed and a concept of Open Community Manufacturing - Development Challenge was created. This paper aims to describe the challenges and potentials of open source innovation and wants to present the concept based on an open design strategy, using the example of South Africa.

AB This paper designs a indoor environmental quality monitoring system, in which indoor environment parameters, such as temperature, humidity and PM2.5 density can be gathered, transmitted and displayed. Arduino, a open-source hardware and software platforms, is used to access sensors. With the help of ZigBee, which is a new wireless communication protocol characterized by low-power, devices composed of Arduino and sensors are placed in different rooms so that the energy consumption can be effectively reduced. In addition, an specific transmission protocol is also be defined for this system. Finally sensor data are transmitted to the internal server and then a cloud platform via WiFi. The result shows that this system is stable and easy to build and change network.

AB The aim of this work is the development of a network of wireless devices to determine, along with a time-stamp, postural changes of users that are to be used in personalized learning environments. For this purpose, we have designed a basic low-cost pressure sensor that can be built from components easily available. Several of these basic sensors (of sizes and shapes chosen specifically for the task) are integrated into a posture sensor cushion, which is electronically controlled by an Arduino microcontroller board. This accounts for experiments involving either a single cushion to be used by an individual end-user setting approach or classroom approaches where several of these cushions make up a sensor network via ZigBee wireless connections. The system thus formed is an excellent alternative to other more expensive commercial systems and provides a low-cost, easy-to-use, portable, scalable, autonomous, flexible solution with free hardware and software, which can be integrated with other sensing devices into a larger affect detection system, customizable to cope with postural changes at required time intervals and support single and collective oriented experimentation approaches.

AB Current state of the art's real time monitoring of fresh produce, provides only temperature and humidity information [1-3]. The idea is to develop new sensors and transport service assisted by ICT platform to monitor fresh produce quality. The technology will be based on radio frequency (RF) wireless network, and will provide real-time and in-site data-logging, enabling active management of food products in storage and transit. The RF sensor network design, allows an auxiliary sensor node to be "plugged in". In this contribution we present the commercial platform developed starting from o fork of open hardware on which we assemble an array of commercial sensors in an "open air" configuration. We developed for this Embedded Gas Sensor System Device (Tinynose) two set-up: the "Development set-up" that uses a star wireless network infrastructure to store all raw sensor output and associated measurement error in a server DB to define parameters in ripening mathematical model and the "TAG set-up" that performs ripening evaluation in ICT in-site platform.

AB The advent of 3D printing is giving us new production opportunities but is creating new economic and social assets. In the paper we will analyze the new conditions we will live in.
   The current industrial production scenario will be analyzed to see how it works and how 3D printing is being introduced into it: where the traditional production comes from and how it actually works, from the historical, technological, social and economic point of view, including transports of materials and products.
   This asset is being "polluted" and possibly transformed by 3D printing: what is it, how it works, but most important, how this technology is transforming our personal approach to industrial products.
   This technological innovation will transform our lives, possibly even more than how movable type printing did: we will see the opportunities offered to adopt this innovation not only for our everyday life, but also looking forward for environmental issues, (e) commerce reorganization and social quality improvement.
   In the final part we will also see what will be the keys to open a new kind of developing path, where technology will take an important part, what relationship with it humans will have, and which will be the keys to succeed in this challenge, identifying in knowledge, awareness and culture of innovation those keys.

TI Safe Motor Controller in a Mixed-Critical Environment with Runtime

DT Article
DE Mixed Critical; Safety Critical; FPGA; Runtime Updating Mechanism;
   Real-Time Operating System; Isolation
AB Safety-critical systems and certification standards are the bare essential elements for the development process of avionics, automotive and industrial embedded systems. The necessity of including non-safety capabilities to reduce the price of these systems has resulted in a new type of critical systems, the mixed-criticality ones. These systems should be able to execute safety-critical applications but, at the same time, to run non-safety-critical functionalities without affecting the integrity of the safetycritical tasks. This paper presents a new system architecture which includes safetycritical and non-safety-critical parts in order to form a mixed-criticality system. The system consists of a reliable platform with a dual-core processor (implemented using a FPGA) architecture designed as open-hardware, running two isolated real-time operating systems which are connected through a safe core-to-core communication channel that executes the safety-critical applications. Moreover, the safety-critical system is connected to an external processor, an ARM9, which is used as an external sensing system. The ARM9 runs the non-safety-critical applications and allows the system to insert modifications updating without affecting the safety capabilities of the safetycritical part. This platform is described providing evidences of the isolation between safety-critical (SC) and non-safety-critical (NSC) applications, as well as describing an updating methodology for non-safety-critical applications. This system is validated using a complete and reliable application for safe emergency stop applications for industrial machinery.

AB Fire detection and protection are major problems in factories. A closely related problem is to localize fire sources to effectively extinguish those. In this paper we presented development of a moderate cost wireless sensor network based fire detection system with indoor localization capability. In Bangladesh, where large numbers of garment factories are located suffers fire incidents every year. The aim of our work was to develop fire detection system that could help the garment owners to install reliable fire detection systems with localizing capability within a relatively lower cost. As such, we have used open source hardware and software tools to develop our system and documented our approach well, so that it can be replicated anywhere.

AB More than 50 billion devices are estimated to be connected to the Internet by 2020. Incompatibility of devices and protocols (usually proprietary devices and protocols) are one of the major hurdles to be overcome to realise the Internet of Things (IoT) vision. IoT devices are typically constrained devices and this creates dependencies between the hardware, software and protocols used in the device. Open hardware and software platforms to support emerging IoT trends are required. A wireless sensor network gateway was developed in a three-month period using off-the-shelf components. The gateway was based on the Raspberry PI single-board computer; it implemented 6LoWPAN mesh and wireless access point functionality for mobile and low power sensing and actuation devices. The gateway was tested in the following use-case: integrate a battery-operated 6LoWPAN-enabled smart water meter to an IPv6 building network. Several factors that influence the gateway's performance and reliability were identified and should be considered when deploying gateway devices for future endeavours.

AB In this article, we examine the challenges of developing intelligent wireless geosystems and the pros and cons of interdisciplinary research. First, we summarize the range of current practices in wireless sensor network research projects by analyzing recent contributions in the literature. Specifically, for each wireless sensor network project, we compile details regarding the scope (e.g., simulation, testbed, real deployment), the type of mote used (e.g., TinyOS, Android, Arduino), and the type of sensors used (e.g., inertial, biological).
   Next, we discuss reasons why Arduino based wireless devices are perhaps the future of applied wireless sensor network research. Arduino-based systems are inexpensive, easy to use, readily available, well documented, 100% open-source (hardware and software), object oriented, extendable (using the "shield" concept), and flexible (e.g., in terms of radio choices). Lastly, we discuss the pros and cons of interdisciplinary research; that is, we highlight the struggle between working on difficult, relevant, inherently multi-disciplinary research problems while maintaining scholarship in individual fields.

The proposed design extends an existing open-source and open-hardware quadrotor project, i. e., the Crazyflie nano quadrotor, by adding the guidance, navigation and control layers required to accomplish autonomous flight. The control layer, in particular, is based on a cascade control algorithm able to globally stabilize the position and the attitude of the vehicle. The global property guaranteed by the algorithm allows the quadrotors to perform aggressive maneuvers. The guidance layer is designed to coordinate simultaneously multiple vehicles by generating suitable reference trajectories. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design.

The server register every process variable in specific databases, which are available from a graphical user interface (GUI) programmed entirely in web language. Such GUI it's accessible from any device with internet access and the corresponding University VPN certificates, which make this SCADA system multi-platform in every aspect.
   To interact physically with the reactor, an Arduino platform is used. It communicates with the server (under an specific protocol) through a communication interface programmed in Phyton. The GUI interacts directly with the database, which is also accessed by the same communication algorithm.

The system is low-cost and easy to produce. The design of both the hardware and related software are available under a free license. In this way, we seek to offer an alternative to the proprietary products currently being used, thus reducing acquisition and maintenance costs and integrating users -students, teachers, and researchers- into the process of improving the system. We outline the features of the first prototypes and the results of several performance tests carried out using the device.

AB Nowadays, customized AT software solutions allow their users to interact with various kinds of computer systems. Such tools are generally available on personal devices (e.g., smartphones, laptops and so on) commonly used by a person with a disability. In this paper, we investigate a way of using the aforementioned AT equipments in order to access many different devices without assistive preferences. The solution takes advantage of open source hardware and its core component consists of an affordable Linux embedded system: it grabs data coming from the assistive software, which runs on the user's personal device, then, after processing, it generates native keyboard and mouse HID commands for the target computing device controlled by the end user. This process supports any operating system available on the target machine and it requires no specialized software installation; therefore the user with a disability can rely on a single assistive tool to control a wide range of computing platforms, including conventional computers and many kinds of mobile devices, which receive input commands through the USB HID protocol.

ID PEER PRODUCTION
AB The spread of ICT and cheap low-size production tools like 3D-printers led to the development of open design, i.e. community-based and open source development of physical products. This innovative organization of product development offers a great opportunity for continuous improvement of products as well as formidable a potential for product innovation and incubation of new businesses. However, because of a limited availability of supporting methods and tools, open design projects are still unable to compete with today's standards of industrial product design. The present article aims at providing a state of the art of existing online tools for open source product development and discusses their limitation regarding the challenges raised by what is identified as an emerging design paradigm. This is performed through the definition of an analysis grid through which existing tools have been scanned as well as a case study. It claims for further empirical research in order to describe the phenomenon from a design science perspective, to define appropriate categories and develop new specific online product data management tools.

AB Vascular stiffness is an indicator of cardiovascular health, with carotid artery stiffness having established correlation to coronary heart disease and utility in cardiovascular diagnosis and screening. State of art equipment for stiffness evaluation are expensive, require expertise to operate and not amenable for field deployment. In this context, we developed ARTerial Stiffness Evaluation for Noninvasive Screening (ARTSENS), a device for image free, noninvasive, automated evaluation of vascular stiffness amenable for field use. ARTSENS has a frugal hardware design, utilizing a single ultrasound transducer to interrogate the carotid artery, integrated with robust algorithms that extract arterial dimensions and compute clinically accepted measures of arterial stiffness. The ability of ARTSENS to measure vascular stiffness in vivo was validated by performing measurements on 125 subjects. The accuracy of results was verified with the state-ofthe-art ultrasound imaging-based echo-tracking system. The relation between arterial stiffness measurements performed in sitting posture for ARTSENS measurement and sitting/supine postures for imaging system was also investigated to examine feasibility of performing ARTSENS measurements in the sitting posture for field deployment. This paper verified the feasibility of the novel ARTSENS device in performing accurate in vivo measurements of arterial stiffness. As a portable device that performs automated measurement of carotid artery stiffness with minimal operator input, ARTSENS has strong potential for use in large-scale screening.

AB This chapter examines the use of Open Source Software (OSS) technologies that can be used to improve the learning of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). Explored are the various methods that can be utilized to improve the percentage of STEM majors in the American educational system with resources such as: Open Source as Alternative (OSALT), virtualization, cloud computing, Linux distributions, open source programming, and open source hardware platforms. Increasing the amount of students that pursue STEM majors is important because the projected job growth in the STEM field compared to non-STEM jobs is 33%. OSALT provides cost-effective alternatives to commercial products such as Microsoft Office Suite and Adobe Photoshop. Second, creating Virtual Machines (VMs) is another avenue to teach complex concepts in computer science, engineering, and Information Technology (IT). Third, cloud computing is an inexpensive way for clients to access information from multiple locations and devices. Fourth, universities can use the Operating System (OS) Linux and its various distributions as replacements for commercial operating systems like Windows in order to reduce IT costs. Lastly, open source programming languages like Python and their associated Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provide comprehensive facilities for software engineers for application development or testing.

AB This article presents an alternative architechture implementation with the purpose of provide real experiments of remote access and expand teaching practices focused on experimentation toward physics education. The research uses a low cost open hardware and an available multiplatform with open source applications. With this initiative, lab resources can be accessed from schools, as many of them have not appropriate science lab for practical activities. This reserch have been applied in two public schools from Ararangua/SC that also face difficulties when using the computer lab. As a solution, the students use their own mobile devices to do science and physics experiments accessing, controlling and observing real experiments installed in the Remote Experimentation Lab (RExLab). Making new experiments is a collaborative work with the teachers of these schools and with the lab staff to adapt their idea to a low cost system with the Raspberry Pi. The study presented here intends to facilitate the experiments adaptation and motivate other research labs to make their experiments available.

AB ObjectiveThe present trial evaluated incorporation of bright light therapy in the treatment of chronic nonspecific back pain (CNBP).
   DesignA prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter, open design with three parallel trial arms was used.
   SettingSubjects received a novel therapeutic, an expected therapeutic ineffective low dose, or no light exposure at three different medical centers.
   PatientsA total of 125 CNBP patients reporting pain intensity of 3 points on item 5 of the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) were included.
   InterventionOver 3 weeks, 36 active treatment, 36 placebo controls, and 33 controls received 3 or no supplementary light exposures of 5.000lx or 230lx, respectively.
   Outcome MeasuresChanges in self-reported scores of pain intensity (BPI sub-score 1) and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Questionnaire) were the primary outcome measures. Secondary outcome measures were changes in self-reported overall pain sensation (BPI total score), grade of everyday life impairment (BPI sub-score 2), mood (visual analog scale), and well-being (World Health Organization-Five Well-Being Index).
   ResultsChanges in pain intensity were higher (1.0 [0.8-1.6]) in the bright light group compared with controls (0.3 [-0.1-0.8]; effect size D=0.46). Changes in the depression score were also higher in the intervention group (1.5 [0.0-2.5]) compared with controls (0.0 [0.0-2.0]; effect size D=0.86). No differences were seen in change scores between intervention vs sham group.
   ConclusionThe present randomized controlled trial shows that light therapy even in low dose could improve depressive symptoms and reduce pain intensity in CNBP patients. Further research is needed for optimizing parameters of frequency, dose, and duration of therapeutic light exposure.

AB Open design is a catchall term for various on- and offline design and making activities. It can be used to describe a type of design process that allows for (is open to) the participation of anybody (novice or professional) in the collaborative development of something. As well as this, it can mean the distribution and unrestricted use of design blueprints and documentation for the use by others.
   In this paper, the authors highlight various aspects of open and collaborative design and argue for the use of new terms that address what is open and when. A range of design projects and online platforms that have open attributes are then explored, whereby these terms are applied. In terms of design, the focus is specifically on the design of physical things rather than graphical, software or system design.

AB Monitoring soil water content at high spatio-temporal resolution and coupled to other sensor data is crucial for applications oriented towards water sustainability in agriculture, such as precision irrigation or phenotyping root traits for drought tolerance. The cost of instrumentation, however, limits measurement frequency and number of sensors. The objective of this work was to design a low cost. open hardware. platform for multi-sensor measurements including water content at different depths, air and soil temperatures. The system is based on an open-source ARDUINO microcontroller-board, programmed in a simple integrated development environment (IDE). Low cost high-frequency dielectric probes were used in the platform and lab tested on three non-saline soils (ECe1: 2.5 < 0.1 mS/cm). Empirical calibration curves were subjected to cross-validation (leave-one-out method), and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) were respectively 0.09 for the overall model, 0.09 for the sandy soil, 0.07 for the clay loam and 0.08 for the sandy loam. The overall model (pooled soil data) fitted the data very well (R-2 = 0.89) showing a high stability, being able to generate very similar RMSEs during training and validation (RMSEtraining = 2.63; RMSEvalidation = 2.61). Data recorded on the card were automatically sent to a remote server allowing repeated field-data quality checks. This work provides a framework for the replication and upgrading of a customized low cost platform, consistent with the open source approach whereby sharing information on equipment design and software facilitates the adoption and continuous improvement of existing technologies.

AB Instrumentino is an open-source modular graphical user interface framework for controlling Arduino based experimental instruments. It expands the control capability of Arduino by allowing instruments builders to easily create a custom user interface program running on an attached personal computer. It enables the definition of operation sequences and their automated running without user intervention. Acquired experimental data and a usage log are automatically saved on the computer for further processing. The use of the programming language Python also allows easy extension. Complex devices, which are difficult to control using an Arduino, may be integrated as well by incorporating third party application programming interfaces into the Instrumentino framework.

ID FUTURE
AB The rise of network speeds to tens of gigabits per second poses a challenge to develop packet processing applications that can cope with such bit rates. Therefore, the need for a suitable open source system that can be used as a prototype platform to test new network functionality while ensuring line-rate processing, accurate timestamping, and reduced power consumption has become evident. All these requirements cannot be achieved by using software-only solutions, but rather with hardware-based platforms such as NetFPGA. The main obstacle when using this type of open source FPGA-based solution is the cost of development, in both time and hardware development skills required. The spread of new circuit synthesis tools using high-level languages opens the door for the development of hardware-based networking applications with reasonable development effort, compared to the use of traditional hardware description languages. In this article, we describe how existing open source hardware-based platforms for networking applications will be fueled by the change in the programming model of FPGAs provided by modern high-level synthesis tools. For this, we implemented a network flow monitor using high-level languages and compared the effort spent with respect to a traditional hardware development cycle. Preliminary results are very promising, given that development time is reduced from months to weeks.

AB Open design has become an umbrella term for a wide range of approaches to design and creativity where professional design is challenged. These range from seeing designers as simply irrelevant (in democratized innovation) to an active and creative collaboration between designers and non-designers (co-design) to the dissolution of the distinction between designer and non-designer altogether.
   While supporting open design in general, we argue that there are important instances where open design approaches may not be appropriate and that there will be a polarization between casual design activity (for cups, T-shirts and so on) and critical designs (medical equipment, very complex systems like mobile phones).

DE Mobile robots; Open source hardware; Open source software
AB The aim of designing and developing an open architecture mobile robot called RoMAA (in accordance with its name in Spanish) arises from the necessity to have a vehicle suitable for carrying out different experiments in the robotics research field. This vehicle has to have the ability to be easily adapted to different experiments in the research field of mobile robotics and computer vision. The present paper describes in detail the development of the final version of the robot -RoMAA-II- as an improvement of the original version RoMAA. The different parts that compose the robot are described which include the electromechanical components, the onboard embedded system, along with the high level software running in the on-board computer; together with the description of its more relevant characteristics. Nowadays, four fully operational RoMAA-II robots are available in the CIII, which are regularly used for experiments of different research projects.

AB The German Federal Office for Radiation Protection operates a network of about 1800 gamma dose rate stations as a part of the national emergency preparedness plan. Each of the six network centres is capable of operating the network alone. Most of the used hardware and software have been developed in-house under open-source license. Short development cycles and close cooperation between developers and users ensure robustness, transparency and fast maintenance procedures, thus avoiding unnecessary complex solutions. This also reduces the overall costs of the network operation. An easy-to-expand web interface has been developed to make the complete system available to other interested network operators in order to increase cooperation between different countries. The interface is also regularly in use for education during scholarships of trainees supported, e. g. by the 'International Atomic Energy Agency' to operate a local area dose rate monitoring test network.

AB Understanding basic concepts of electronics and computer programming allows researchers to get the most out of the equipment found in their laboratories. Although a number of platforms have been specifically designed for the general public and are supported by a vast array of on-line tutorials, this subject is not normally included in university chemistry curricula. Aiming to provide the basic concepts of hardware and software, this article is focused on the design and use of a simple module to control a series of PDMS-based valves. The module is based on a low-cost microprocessor (Teensy) and open-source software (Arduino). The microvalves were fabricated using thin sheets of PDMS and patterned using CO2 laser engraving, providing a simple and efficient way to fabricate devices without the traditional photolithographic process or facilities. Synchronization of valve control enabled the development of two simple devices to perform injection (1.6 +/- 0.4 mu L/stroke) and mixing of different solutions. Furthermore, a practical demonstration of the utility of this system for microscale chemical sample handling and analysis was achieved performing an on-chip acid-base titration, followed by conductivity detection with an open-source low-cost detection system. Overall, the system provided a very reproducible (98%) platform to perform fluid delivery at the microfluidic scale.

AB Building on the award-winning, portfolio-based ASP solver claspfolio, we present claspfolio 2, a modular and open solver architecture that integrates several different portfolio-based algorithm selection approaches and techniques. The claspfolio 2 solver framework supports various feature generators, solver selection approaches, solver portfolios, as well as solver-schedule-based pre-solving techniques. The default configuration of claspfolio 2 relies on a light-weight version of the ASP solver clasp to generate static and dynamic instance features. The flexible open design of claspfolio 2 is a distinguishing factor even beyond ASP. As such, it provides a unique framework for comparing and combining existing portfolio-based algorithm selection approaches and techniques in a single, unified framework. Taking advantage of this, we conducted an extensive experimental study to assess the impact of different feature sets, selection approaches and base solver portfolios. In addition to gaining substantial insights into the utility of the various approaches and techniques, we identified a default configuration of claspfolio 2 that achieves substantial performance gains not only over clasp's default configuration and the earlier version of claspfolio, but also over manually tuned configurations of clasp.

DE Markov decision process; Design metrics; Changeability
ID OPTIMIZATION; FLEXIBILITY; MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK; TIME
AB This paper introduces metrics derived from application of a Markov decision process to evaluate a design's changeability. Changeability is known to improve product performance if conscientious early-stage design decisions are matched with structured management of the system in response to exogenous disturbances-shifts which may be environmental, market, technological, and political in nature. Included in the paper is a brief discussion of changeability's role in ensuring strategic product performance as well as a review of past metrics developed, highlighting the open design challenge to more fully capture the managerial and process dimensions inherent to changeability. The proposed metrics are featured in a case study related to the ballast water system of an ocean-going vessel. The result of such application is greater context for the value changeability offers and an improved understanding of the resources required to manage uncertainty over the product's life cycle.

AB In this modern world many communication devices are highly intelligent and interconnected between each other. Any up-gradation of the hardware in the existing communication devices is not easier one. Compatibility of the new hardware with existing hardware is highly essential. But the new protocols may or may not support the older one. The solution for these problems can be provided by using the reconfigurable hardware design. The hardware can be reprogrammed according to the new change in technology up-gradation. The cost of commercially available hardware and software requirements for setting up such a module is very high. This can be solved by using Open source hardware and software such as Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) and GNU Radio. This work demonstrates how the modern analog communication system like Community Radio Schemes and Radio Data System (RDS) and digital communication systems such as Simple Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) and OFDM based data communication can be developed using the Open source hardware USRP1. This work will be helpful even for first year level of engineering students to easily implement any communication and control applications with cheaper cost.

ID PLATFORM; EDF
AB Rapid prototyping is a key aspect for the development of innovative robotic applications. A modular, platform-based, approach is the way to obtain this result. Modular approaches are common for software development, but hardware is still crafted often re-inventing solutions every time. As a consequence, the resources that should be invested in the development of a new robot get often drained by the implementation of a physical, working prototype to test the application idea. To overcome this problem, we propose R2P (Rapid Robot Prototyping), a framework to implement real-time, high-quality architectures for robotic systems with off-the-shelf basic modules (e.g., sensors, actuators, and controllers), integrating hardware and software, which can be assembled in a plug-and-play way. R2P provides hardware modules, a protocol for real-time communication, a middleware to connect components as well as tools to support the development of software on the modules. R2P aims at dramatically reduce time and efforts required to build a prototype robot, making it possible to focus the resources on the development of new robotic applications instead of struggling on their implementation. This enables also people with experience in a specific application domain, but with little technical background, to actively participate in the development of new robotic applications. R2P is open-source both in its software and hardware to promote its diffusion among the robotics community and novel business models that will substantially reduce the costs to design a new robotic product.

AB Four studies examined the relationship between mindfulness and interoception (measured via cardiac perception). Studies 1 and 2 compared participants undergoing week long practice (15 m daily) of an audiotaped body-scan, relative to a sound-scan and no-intervention control condition (n=20 per group). No significant differences in change in cardiac perception accuracy, confidence in cardiac accuracy judgements or the correlation between them (coherence) were found between conditions. Study 3 used an open design to examine the effects of a more intensive meditation training (completing an 8-week MBSR or MBCT course; n=19). Cardiac perception accuracy and coherence did not improve, but participants became significantly more confident. Study 4 examined the relationship between cardiac perception and trait mindfulness (n=165). Trait mindfulness did not relate to cardiac perception accuracy, but more mindful individuals were more confident. Mindful observation was associated with reduced, whereas other components of mindfulness predicted superior, coherence. These findings suggest that mindfulness practice does not simply work by improving cardiac perception accuracy but does increase confidence. However, it remains possible that mindfulness increases perceptual accuracy of other bodily systems, which needs to be explored using a wider array of experimental measures (e. g. respiratory awareness) in future research.

AB Background: Careful observation of the longitudinal course of bipolar disorders is pivotal to finding optimal treatments and improving outcome. A useful tool is the daily prospective Life-Chart Method, developed by the National Institute of Mental Health. However, it remains unclear whether the patient version is as valid as the clinician version.
   Methods: We compared the patient-rated version of the Lifechart (LC-self) with the Young-Mania-Rating Scale (YMRS), Inventory of Depressive Symptoms-Clinician version (IDS-C), and Clinical Global Impression-Bipolar version (CGI-BP) in 108 bipolar I and II patients who participated in the Naturalistic Follow-up Study (NFS) of the German centres of the Bipolar Collaborative Network (BCN; formerly Stanley Foundation Bipolar Network). For statistical evaluation, levels of severity of mood states on the Lifechart were transformed numerically and comparison with affective scales was performed using chi-square and t tests. For testing correlations Pearson's coefficient was calculated.
   Results: Ratings for depression of LC-self and total scores of IDS-C were found to be highly correlated (Pearson coefficient r = -.718; p < .001), whilst the correlation of ratings for mania with YMRS compared to LC-self were slightly less robust (Pearson coefficient r = .491; p = .001). These results were confirmed by good correlations between the CGI-BP IA (mania), IB (depression) and IC (overall mood state) and the LC-self ratings (Pearson coefficient r = .488, r = .721 and r = .65, respectively; all p < .001).
   Conclusions: The LC-self shows a significant correlation and good concordance with standard cross sectional affective rating scales, suggesting that the LC-self is a valid and time and money saving alternative to the clinician-rated version which should be incorporated in future clinical research in bipolar disorder. Generalizability of the results is limited by the selection of highly motivated patients in specialized bipolar centres and by the open design of the study.

AB Background: Many neuroscience experiments rely on presenting stimuli and measuring participants' responses to these events. Often computer screens, speakers and keyboards are sufficient. However, these devices are not appropriate for some situations. For example, some studies present tactile or olfactory stimuli or brain stimulation. Likewise, keyboard buttons are not appropriate for use with vocal responses, small animals or individuals with motor impairments.
   New method: We describe StimSync, which simulates USB keyboard inputs, allowing use with most experimental software. StimSync can measure button presses, optical signals from magnetic resonance imaging systems, changes in ambient light (e.g. synchronizing intracranial electrography), and auditory events (a voice key). In addition to the USB keyboard mode (necessarily millisecond precision), StimSync can also be set to provide higher precision timing. This feature can be used to validate timing, ensuring event synchronization (e.g. auditory events, visual events, brain stimulation). In addition to recording inputs, StimSync provides seven digital outputs for controlling external devices. Finally, StimSync can record analog inputs; we illustrate how this can be used to evaluate the rise time for computer displays.
   Results: We observed outputs with a mean latency of 2.1 ms (sd = 0.17 ms) and USB inputs with a mean latency of 2 ms (sd = 0.54 ms).
   Comparison with existing method(s): StimSync statistically outperforms two professional solutions and numerically outperforms other devices described in the literature.
   Conclusions: StimSync (http://www.mccauslandcenter.sc.edu/CRNL/tools/stimsync) provides an open-source solution for controlling and validating neuroscience experiments. In addition to sharing the design, we have produced a batch of devices to demonstrate the market for professional implementations. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The performance of optical coatings may be negatively affected by the deleterious effects of mechanical stress. In this work, we propose an optimization tool for the design of optical filters taking into account both the optical and mechanical properties of the substrate and of the individual deposited layers. The proposed method has been implemented as a supplemental module in the OpenFilters open source design software. It has been experimentally validated by fabricating multilayer stacks using e-beam evaporation, in combination with their mechanical stress assessment performed as a function of temperature. Two different stress-compensation strategies were evaluated: (a) design of two complementary coatings on either side of the substrate and (b) implementing the mechanical properties of the individual materials in the design of the optical coating on one side only. This approach has been tested by the manufacture of a Fabry-Perot etalon used in astronomy while using evaporated SiO2 and TiO2 films. We found that the substrate curvature can be decreased by 85% and 49% for the first and second strategies, respectively. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America

AB Introduction: To compare early and long-term outcomes of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) versus open repair (OPEN). Design: Prospective observational, per protocol, non-randomized, with retrospective analyses.
   Material and methods: Between 2000 and 2005, a total of 311 patients having EVAR or OPEN repair of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms were identified and included in this prospective single-center observational study. A propensity score-based optimal-matching algorithm was employed, and 138 patients undergoing EVAR procedures were matched (1: 1) to OPEN repair.
   Results: Open repair showed higher hospital mortality (17% vs. 6%, p = 0.004), respiratory failure (p < 0.026), transfusion requirement (p < 0.001), and intensive care unit admission (27% vs. 7%, p < 0.001), and longer hospitalization (p < 0.001). Median follow-up was 70 months (25th to 75th percentile, 24 to 101). Actuarial survival estimates at 1, 5 and 10 years were 93%, 74%, 49% for the OPEN group compared to 89%, 69%, 59% for the EVAR group (p = 0.465). A significant difference between groups was observed in younger patients (< 75 years) only (p < 0.044). Late complication and re-intervention rates were significantly higher in EVAR patients (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively). Freedom from late complications at 1, 5 and 10 years was 96%, 92%, 86%, and 84%, 70%, 64% for OPEN and EVAR procedures, respectively.
   Conclusions: Our experience confirms the excellent results of the EVAR procedures, offering excellent early and long-term results in terms of safety and reduction of mortality. Patients < 75 years seem to benefit from EVAR not only in the immediate postoperative period but even in a long-term perspective.

AB Turbidity is an internationally recognized criterion for assessing drinking water quality, because the colloidal particles in turbid water may harbor pathogens, chemically reduce oxidizing disinfectants, and hinder attempts to disinfect water with ultraviolet radiation. A turbidimeter is an electronic/optical instrument that assesses turbidity by measuring the scattering of light passing through a water sample containing such colloidal particles. Commercial turbidimeters cost hundreds or thousands of dollars, putting them beyond the reach of low-resource communities around the world. An affordable open-source turbidimeter based on a single light-to-frequency sensor was designed and constructed, and evaluated against a portable commercial turbidimeter. The final product, which builds on extensive published research, is intended to catalyze further developments in affordable water and sanitation monitoring.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study presents a detailed account of processes and multiple methodologies used in conducting a diagnostic post-occupancy evaluation (POE) in an urban hospital emergency department.
   BACKGROUND: Healthcare design POE research findings can lead to improved work environments for healthcare providers and higher levels of staff, patient, and visitor satisfaction.
   METHODS: This evaluation was conducted in two separate phases over 12 months, with data analysis occurring after each phase. Phase 1 involved 200 hours of observation, physical measurements, and occupancy counts. Phase 2 included surveys (n = 315) of staff, visitors, and patients. In addition, eight distinct staff focus groups (e.g., Nursing, Housekeeping, Physician, etc.) were conducted.
   RESULTS: To illustrate the process, one healthcare design-related issue, privacy and confidentiality, was assessed in light of the linear design model with a central core. Phase 1 observation results indicated that most confidential conversations were contained within the linear core. However, Phase 2 focus groups revealed that many staff members had concerns regarding the level of privacy and confidentiality due to the core's open design. The use of multiple methods provided greater information and a more comprehensive picture of the emergency department environment and design.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a comprehensive framework for diagnostic post-occupancy evaluation in healthcare design. The findings indicate that a systematic, multi-methodological approach developed around a conceptual framework can lead to higher quality evaluations. Diagnostic POEs should be grounded in extant literature and customized based on the setting, the client's guiding principles, and the design team's objectives. In diagnostic POEs, one size does not fit all.

AB For security and privacy considerations, it is important for Android users to understand the behavior and the risk of an application. Although Google claims that new applications available on the official market have passed their security checks, the open design of the Android system still allows a user to install applications for third-party vendors. Therefore, there is still a demand for users to know more about an unknown application. In this paper, we discussed our experiences on setting up a scalable automated Android behavior monitor using virtualization techniques. Our contribution is two-fold: (1) We design and implement a scalable behavior monitor using both dynamic analysis and static analysis techniques; and (2) Based on parts of the analyzed results, we develop a preliminary filter to distinguish benign and malicious applications. The system is open to the public and we expect that the analyzed results can be fed back to the research community and further stimulate more studies on analyzing malicious Android applications.

AB The ever-intensifying time-to-market pressure imposes great challenges on the pre-silicon design phase of hardware. Before the tape-out, a pre-silicon design has to be thoroughly inspected by time-consuming functional verification and code review to exclude bugs. For functional verification and code review, a critical issue determining their efficiency is the allocation of resources (e.g., computational resources and manpower) to different modules of a design, which is conventionally guided by designers' experiences. Such practices, though simple and straightforward, may take high risks of wasting resources on bug-free modules or missing bugs in buggy modules, and thus could affect the success and timeline of the tape-out. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called pre-silicon bug forecast to predict the bug information of hardware designs. In this framework, bug models are built via machine learning techniques to characterize the relationship between design characteristics and the bug information, which can be leveraged to predict how bugs distribute in different modules of the current design. Such predicted bug information is adequate to regulate the resources among different modules to achieve efficient functional verification and code review. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed pre-silicon bug forecast framework, we conducted detailed experiments on several open-source hardware projects. Moreover, we also investigate the impacts of different learning techniques and different sets of characteristic on the performance of bug models. Experimental results show that with appropriate learning techniques and characteristics, about 90% modules could be correctly predicted as buggy or clean and the number of bugs of each module could also be accurately predicted.

ID MASSENFILTER
AB The fundamental principles of quadrupole mass spectrometers (QMS) are discussed, concentrating on instruments used in vacuum applications.
   The mass-selective element is the quadrupole mass filter, first described in a 1956 patent. Although originally intended for isotope separation, the concept soon became applied to analytical chemistry and to residual gas analysis (RGA), also known as partial pressure analysis (PPA). The ion optical design of a typical general-purpose quadrupole RGA has altered little since the 1970s although of course there have been major advances in electronics packaging, data capture, and automation. There is growing interest in miniaturised systems for high-pressure work.
   These instruments mostly use electron-impact ionization sources, based on principles established nearly 100 years ago. Those used for vacuum applications are generally of two types: an "open" design, rather like a miniature Bayerd-Alpert gauge, and a "closed" design, generally based on Nier's work.
   The simplest and most robust detector is a Faraday collector; alternatively an electron multiplier is used when the highest sensitivity is required.
   Often the quadrupole drive electronics and the amplifier are mounted directly on the vacuum flange, giving a compact assembly. Instrument control and data acquisition is almost always done via a computer interface. This gives a very versatile and powerful system. Nevertheless, to obtain the maximum benefit from any mass spectrometer it is often necessary to keep in mind the underlying physical principles. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Using millimeter-wave spectroscopy, we study the electromagnetic response of asymmetric split-ring resonators made from superconducting niobium. The asymmetry is introduced by using different arm lengths of the U-shape split-ring design. A small asymmetry allows the excitation of an otherwise dark mode with only a weak coupling to electromagnetic field. The radiation losses are strongly reduced in this geometry. The combination of weak electromagnetic coupling and reduced ohmic losses in a superconductor leads to high quality factors of split-ring resonators. Quality factors of up to 150 in an open design are achieved experimentally. (C) 2014 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

AB A mobile and modular educational robotic platform called "Yrobot" is presented for the purpose of increasing students interest in studying technical suNects, to support teaching and to promote the selected areas of the information and communication technologies. The developed mobile robotic system is open hardware. Its base part - a mobile robotic platform - is being continuously extended by expansion modules to enable the development and implementation of the specific applications. As the first expansion module for the "Yrobot", an audio-communication subsystem module based on Texas Instruments solutions has been developed. This extension module is called "AudioCom" and allows the development and verification of the simple modulation techniques operation. These techniques are commonly used in the radio frequency communication as well. This paper describes the motivation for the development of the mentioned platform, the expansion module circuit design, software solution and the experimental testing results.

AB littleBits (littleBits. cc) is an open-source hardware library of pre-assembled analogue components that can be easily assembled into circuits, disassembled, reassembled, and re-used. In this paper, we consider littleBits - and the littleBits SynthKit in particular - as a physically-embodied domain specific programming language. We describe the littleBits system, explain how littleBits "programs" are constructed as configurations of physical modules in the real world, and describe how they are typically used to control physical artefacts or constructions. We then argue that littleBits constructions essentially "visualise themselves". We describe how littleBits' liveness, embodiment, and plasticity assists both learning and debugging, and then evaluate littleBits configurations according to the cognitive dimensions of notations.

ID BODY-SIZE
AB Globalized marketplaces are necessitating the consideration of the needs of users from a variety of national and international regions. Relevant body dimensions are known to play a key role in influencing users' physical interactions with products. The main challenge in designing these products is the unavailability of comprehensive anthropometric databases for detailed analyses and decision-making. This paper presents a new method to this end. Z-scores are computed for each body measure of every individual in a reference population; this can be any population for which a comprehensive database is available. Next, descriptive statistical information (e.g., means, standard deviations, by-percentile values) from numerous studies and surveys are used to estimate distributions of the required body dimensions. Finally, the z-score values from the reference population are utilized to sample from the aforementioned distributions in order to synthesize the requisite virtual target population of users. The z-score method is demonstrated in the context of two existing populations: U.S. military in the late 1980s (ANSUR) and Japanese youth from the early 1990s. Despite certain stated limitations, which are topics of future work in this line of research, the method is shown to be accurate, easy-to-apply, and robust in terms of underlying assumptions.

It aims to contribute to a discussion on the importance of sensing-based mapping of urban phenomena following our assertion that current delivery of urban analysis methodologies, with their emphasis on visuo-spatial analysis only, fail to create maps that reflect the nuanced and layered interrelationships between the people and the physical environmental space they live in. In essence, the paper will bring to light the set up components and deployment of a mobile sensing kit that allows for usually mapped static invisible data (air quality, temperature, humidity) to be mapped as visible data. In other words, we want to explore how real-time geo-referenced data collection can enhance traditional data mapping and visualization methods enabling designers to understand better the urban space.

AB Today, the environmental monitoring and quality have a growing interest. This promotes the development of new monitoring tools, and especially those with outstanding reliability and response time, and nonstationary features. This paper presents the design and implementation of a transportable gas detection and environmental monitoring device. Ideas taken from the Arduino and Lego constructions are kept in mind during the design of the device, looking further facilitate the development of product family of this device; likewise, the use of reconfigurable and interconnectable platforms with open hardware are considered. The transducers have been selected based on their reliability, small size and easy inclusion in an electronic system. Then, was developed a device that supports transducers for environmental gases, such as: carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O-3), volatile organic compounds (VOC), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2); as well as the possibility to interface with other systems for common gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxygen (O-2) before developed. Other environmental measures such as speed and wind direction, temperature and relative humidity, may also be included. In this case, a configurable platform based on mixed-signal circuits, PSoC5, was used for the development of embedded system. This platform can be interfaced with different Arduino shields and achieves the integration of several analog functions. This system manages, acquires and processes signals from the above transducers. The measurements can be displayed on an LCD display, save into an SD memory and send to the Web using Ethernet interface. The device is hand size, easy to carry and can operate with a battery. Its user interface is simple and provides updated and in-situ readings. Currently, successful results have been obtained from the functional and metrology testing of the manufactured prototype.

AB The diagnosis of electrical motors through the detection of fault frequency signatures in the current's spectrum has become an established standard in the field of industrial maintenance systems. Nevertheles, its implementation on devices with low computing power remains a practical challenge. Industrial controllers, such as programmable logic controllers, or modern, low cost controller hardware, such as the Arduino or the Raspberry Pi open source hardware proposals, lack both the on-board memory and the high speed data acquisition hardware to perform an accurate spectral analysis of the machine's current, in order to identify the spectral components produced by each type of fault. In this paper, a signal conditioning unit, based on a novel downsampling method of the current, is presented. This unit reduces the amount of current samples that must be processed by the diagnostic unit to a mere sample per current cycle, maintains the sub-hertz accuracy needed to resolve fault, and converts the mains component into a constant value that can be easily eliminated without using any additional filter. Besides, it is implemented using low cost devices, just resistors and operational amplifiers. The proposed method is theoretically developed in this paper, and it has been validated using induction motors with broken bars fed directly by the mains or through variable speed drives.

AB A key issue in VoIP services market is the availability of tools that permit a constant monitoring of the relevant Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. Several commercial and open-source solutions are available, based on dedicated hardware and/or open-source software. These solutions aim to achieve a tradeoff between performance and instrumentation cost. In general, high performance and precise monitoring tools are based on dedicated hardware, which is expensive. In contrast, cheaper software-based solutions working on top of a Commercially available Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware are performance-limited, especially when serving high-capacity links. In this context, the paper presents an open-source solution for QoS monitoring of VoIP traffic that achieves high performance at significantly lower costs. The proposed solution exploits the performance capabilities achievable with a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The associated costs reduction arises from the high flexibility of an FPGA. Our experimental analysis explores the accuracy of the developed prototype, measuring against relevant QoS parameters of VoIP traffic on high capacity links.

AB The objective of this paper is to describe a Product Lifecycle Management process for IEEE's Humanitarian Technology (HT) "Solutions" that leverages IEEE's peer-review. In 2011, the Humanitarian Initiatives Committee (HIC) of IEEE Region 7 organized a student design competition [1] with the specific objective of understanding the design process of HT "Solutions" to be made available as open source. The 2011 competition was an initial effort to understand open source licensing, open source hardware and the open source development model. Adoption of the open source development model was a stated objective of IEEE's Humanitarian technology Challenge (HTC) [2]. The HIC held a student paper competition in 2013. The goal of the 2013 competition was to nurture the growing interest in Humanitarian Technology in Region 7; to address HIC's concerns from the 2011 competition, more effort was focused in the paper review process for the 2013 competition and standard IEEE peer-review tools and processes were used. This document presents in Section III the lessons learned during these two competitions, and proposes in section IV a Product Lifecycle Management framework for the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) of OSI development that leverages IEEE's peer-review process.

AB There have been several exciting developments in the technologies commonly used n in the hardware hacking community. Advances in low cost additive-manufacturing processes (i.e. 3D-printers) and the development of open-hardware projects, which have produced inexpensive and easily programmable micro-controllers and micro-computers (i.e. Arduino and Raspberry Pi) have opened a new door for individuals seeking to make their own devices. Here we describe the potential for these technologies to reduce costs in construction and development of submillimeter/millimeter astronomical instrumentation. Specifically we have begun a program to measure the optical properties of the custom plastics used in 3D-printers as well as the printer accuracy and resolution to assess the feasibility of directly printing sub/millimeter transmissive optics. We will also discuss low cost designs for cryogenic temperature measurement and control utilizing Arduino and Raspberry Pi.

AB Color science is perhaps the most universally tangible discipline within the optical sciences for people of all ages. Excepting a small and relatively well-understood minority, we can see that the world around us consists of a multitude of colors; yet, describing the "what", "why", and "how" of these colors is not an easy task, especially without some sort of equally colorful visual aids. While static displays (e.g., poster boards, etc.) serve their purpose, there is a growing trend, aided by the recent permeation of small interactive devices into our society, for interactive and immersive learning. However, for the uninitiated, designing software and hardware for this purpose may not be within the purview of all optical scientists and engineers.
   Enter open source. Open source "anything" are those tools and designs -- hardware or software -- that are available and free to use, often without any restrictive licensing. Open source software may be familiar to some, but the open source hardware movement is relatively new. These are electronic circuit board designs that are provided for free and can be implemented in physical hardware by anyone. This movement has led to the availability of some relatively inexpensive, but quite capable, computing power for the creation of small devices.
   This paper will showcase the design and implementation of the software and hardware that was used to create an interactive demonstration kit for color. Its purpose is to introduce and demonstrate the concepts of color spectra, additive color, color rendering, and metamers.

AB This paper proposes a simple Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)-based air quality monitoring system (WSN-AQMS) for industrial and urban areas. The proposed framework comprises a set of gas sensors (ozone, CO, and NO2) that are deployed on stacks and infrastructure of a Zigbee WSN and a central server to support both short-term real-time incident management and a long-term strategic planning. This architecture would use open-hardware open-software gas sensing capable motes [6] made by Libelium. These motes use the ZigBee communication protocol and provide a real-time low cost monitoring system through the use of low cost, low data rate, and low power wireless communication technology. The proposed monitoring system can be transferred to or shared by other applications. We also introduce a simple but efficient clustering protocol dubbed hereafter "Clustering Protocol for Air Sensor network" (CPAS) for the proposed WSN-AQMS framework. CPAS proves to be efficient in terms of network energy consumption, network lifetime, and the rate at which data is communicated.

AB This chapter illustrates how to set up an inexpensive but effective Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) platform for the test of wind turbine (WT) controllers. The dynamics of the WT are simulated on the open-source National Renewable Energy Laboratory WT simulator called FAST (Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structures, and Turbulence), which emulates all required input signals of the controller and reacts to the controller commands (almost) like an onshore real turbine of 5 MW. The dynamic torque control system runs on an open hardware Arduino microcontroller board, which is connected to the virtual WT via USB. In particular, the power generation control in the full load region for variable-speed variable-pitch wind turbines is considered through torque and pitch control. The HIL proposed platform is used to characterize the behavior of the WT in normal operation as well as in fault operation. In particular, a stuck/unstuck fault is modeled and the behavior of a proposed chattering torque controller is analyzed in comparison to a baseline torque controller.

AB In this paper we present a series of design directions for the development of affordable, compliant, modular, underactuated robot fingers, that can be used as prostheses by amputees that suffer from various partial hand amputations (index to pinky fingers are considered). Our design is based on parametric models that have been derived from hand anthropometry studies. Various interfaces have been considered in order to control the prosthesis, depending on the type and level of amputation. More precisely: 1) An Electromyography (EMG) based interface is used to control the robot fingers employing the EMG signals of the human forearm muscles 2) A flex sensors based interface is used to record the motion of the intact finger/fingers and predict the motion of the prosthesis implementing a synergistic behavior in an efficient manner, 3) A body powered interface is used for those that want to achieve even lower cost, with robust intuitive operation. Following the proposed design directions, an amputee will be able to replicate our fingers and develop personalized, affordable, light-weight but yet efficient prostheses.

The proposed robot hands, efficiently grasp a series of everyday life objects and are considered to be general purpose, as they can be used for various applications. The efficiency of the proposed robot hands has been experimentally validated through a series of experimental paradigms, involving: grasping of multiple everyday life objects with different geometries, myoelectric (EMG) control of the robot hands in grasping tasks, preliminary results on a grasping capable quadrotor and autonomous grasp planning under object position and shape uncertainties.

AB The NASA Ames Research Center (NASA Ames) Center Chief Technologist (CCT) Office sponsors the Advanced Digital Materials and Manufacturing for Space (ADMMS) Initiative, which focuses on advanced manufacturing technologies for space, including identifying several target products, areas and applications, approaches for advanced manufacturing, mechanisms for collaboration, and complementary facilities. The pilot project for this initiative is the Multi-Purpose Avionics Core Element (M-PACE). The primary goal of M-PACE is to demonstrate advanced manufacturing techniques, such as additive manufacturing and Digital Materials, to minimize the cost of cube satellites and increase their modularity. M-PACE will be designed and built at the NASA Ames' SpaceShop, which is a state-of-the-art advanced manufacturing facility built for NASA researchers to formulate ideas for projects. The final products of M-PACE are several completed side panels of a one-unit (1U) (10 cm cube) cube satellite prototype built using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components, which will show the basic functionality of the internal payload by connecting it to the side panels for power and other subsystem capabilities. Within the structure, we are investigating the use of Digital Materials, which are universal building materials with the ability to increase precision and ease of assembly and disassembly of three dimensional (3D) objects. M-PACE will use COTS power systems and open-source hardware and software to distribute data through Ethernet through the use of snap-fit card connectors. Similar to Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) Express cards, we envision the spacecraft subsystems and payloads to be on a PC104-like board that will slide into the side panel connectors to enable distribution of power and data. This design has the potential to greatly reduce the cost of Cube Satellite testing and integration due to the absence of wires and ease of access to internal boards for any necessary modifications.

AB Small modular reactors (SMRs) offer potential for addressing the nation's long-term energy needs. However, the project design cycle for new reactor concepts is lengthy. As part of the Department of Energy's(1) Advanced SMR research and development program, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is developing a Dynamic System Modeling Tool (MoDSIM) to facilitate rapid instrumentation and controls studies of SMR concepts.
   Traditional nuclear reactor design makes use of verified and validated codes to meet the strict quality assurance requirements of the licensing process for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. However, there are significant engineering analyses and high-level decisions required prior to the rigorous design phase. These analyses typically do not require high-fidelity codes. Different organizations and researchers may examine various plant configuration options prior to formal design activities. Engineers and managers must continuously make down-selection decisions regarding potential reactor architectures and subsystems. Traditionally, the modeling of these complex systems has been based on legacy models. Considerable time and effort are necessary to understand and manipulate these legacy models. For trade-space studies, two developments in the model-based systems engineering space represent a significant advancement in the ability of engineering tools to meet these demands. The first is Modelica: a nonproprietary, equation-based, object-oriented modeling language for cyber-physical systems. The second is the Functional Mockup Interface: a standardized, open interface for model exchange, simulation, and deployment.
   ORNL's MoDSIM tool makes use of these developments and is intended to provide a flexible and robust dynamic system-modeling environment for SMRs. This includes single or multiple reactors, perhaps sharing common resources, or producing both electricity and process heat for local consumption or feeding a regional grid. MoDSIM uses the open-source modeling language (Modelica) and incorporates a user interface, coupled dynamic models, and analysis capabilities that will enable non-expert modelers to perform sophisticated end-to-end system simulations of both neutronic and thermal-hydraulic models. This approach enables opensource and crowd-source-type collaborations for model development of SMRs in an approach similar to open-source and open-design techniques currently used for software production and complex system design. As part of the tool development, an example SMR was chosen (advanced liquid metal reactor [ALMR]) and the ALMR models developed and interface tools demonstrated. For initial verification purposes, the results from these Modelica simulations are compared with the results documented for the earlier ALMR power-reactor innovative small-module concept. These results, as well as initial demonstrations of the tool for different control strategies, are presented in this paper.

AB Global warming is an issue that keeps coming up recently with the increase of temperature and carbon dioxide level. Scientist believes that the main cause of this is because of the deforestation, pollution, carbon emission from transportation and factories that led to this global warming. However, there are also skeptics that believe otherwise. To prove the cause of global warming and whether it is an event that occurs every now and then as some skeptics and scientists suggested a multi sensor device is build, which consist of temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide and oxygen. With limited funding and a few different location to be tested to prove this phenomena, a low cost device is built so that it will be within the budget of this project as well give the result that is to determine whether development has cause the global warming and forest and absorbing the CO2 emission to keep the world cool. Thanks to open source hardware, the sensor system can be build economically.

AB Prototyping and engineering robot hardware and low-level control often require time and efforts thus subtracted to core research activities, such as SLAM or planning algorithms development, which need a working, reliable, platform to be evaluated in a real world scenario. In this paper, we present Rapid Robot Prototyping (R2P), an open source, hardware and software architecture for the rapid prototyping of robotic applications, where off-the-shelf embedded modules (e.g., sensors, actuators, and controllers) are combined together in a plug-and-play fashion, enabling the implementation of a complex system in a simple and modular way. R2P makes people involved in robotics, from researchers and designers to students and hobbyists, dramatically reduce the time and efforts required to build a robot prototype.

AB The robot open source software community, in particular ROS, drastically boosted robotics research. However, a centralized place to exchange open hardware designs does not exist. Therefore we launched the Robotic Open Platform (ROP). A place to share and discuss open hardware designs. Among others it currently contains detailed descriptions of Willow Garage's TurtleBot, the NimbRo-OP created by the University of Bonn and the AMIGO robot of Tech United Eindhoven. Eventually, ROP will contain a collection of affordable hardware components, allowing researchers to focus on cutting-edge research on a particular component instead of having to design the entire robot from scratch. As an example of how the Robotic Open Platform is able to facilitate this knowledge transfer, we introduce TURTLE-5k: A redesign of an existing soccer robot by a consortium of our university and companies in the wider Eindhoven area. Cooperating with industrial partners resulted in a significant cost reduction.

AB This paper explains the design of a communication system, using an Arduino microcontroller and GSM Module and its functions / associated components to be implemented in a microgrid. The microgrid control and coordination infrastructure has been realized as a hierarchical multi-agent system (MAS) comprising of the DG agents, the Mu agent and the D agent. The Communication (Mu) Agent acts as a link between the lower-level microgrid agents (distributed energy resources (DERs), the load, the storage and the utility grid) which provide the required digital parameter inputs, and the Control Agent comprising of the Cloud. Data storage, analytics and control commands are generated based on the rule engine updates given by the Utility Service Provider (USP) to the Cloud. The microgrid side input data are converted into appropriate GPRS signals within the Arduino. The specific functions that enable this conversion are elucidated as pseudocode. Further, the cloud control commands are sent back to the various microgrid-side agents via the Mu agent as GPRS signals. The communication strategy has been explained in detail and has been implemented using Arduino keeping in mind system costs, ease of operability and maintenance.

AB The Abbey of Santa Maria extra moenia is a historical complex located in the Marche region (Italy). It has undergone substantial transformations over the centuries. For this reason, the historical and critical interpretation requires a key capable of simplifying the understanding of all the modifications.
   Starting from both an archival study and an architectural survey, we created different 3D models to help analyze and understand all the historical and architectural phases of the complex. The 3D-model reconstructions are based on metric and land surveys. The survey permitted us to identify seven main historical phases. In this way knowledge of the abbey becomes an elaborate history that needs an appropriate dissemination tool. The abbey is now abandoned due to its poor state and no action has been taken for its improvement or preservation. A first step in raising awareness of this forgotten cultural object is to foster better knowledge of its history through a new visual interface that is able to clarify all the events that have occurred over time. In order to explain the complex history of the abbey, we tested a new approach based on the use of a mock-up as a physical interface allowing access to different digital content. For this purpose we used open-source hardware: an Arduino-based microcontroller, named Makey Makey, connected to different parts of the mock-up through wired buttons. In this way, the computer processes the signal coming from the buttons using the mock-up like a keyboard to manage all the information related to the abbey.

AB While cornerstone and capstone courses teach "design" at the beginning and end of many computer engineering programs, a design gap is left in the sophomore and junior years. This paper describes the development and experiences of teaching five semesters of a specialized design course for a computer engineering program taught in the junior year. The course includes topics in software design patterns, multi-threaded applications, rudimentary user-interface design, embedded programming including sensor building and processing, and Zigbee-based wireless communications. The course is 2 semester credits (1-2-3), and includes a comprehensive project that requires students to build a tangible game or a game-like entertainment system. One key component of the course is the use of an open-source hardware platform called Arduino. The results are that students enjoy the course and are able to build integrated systems that incorporate design patterns, multi-threading, embedded programming and wireless communication in an effective manner within one semester.

AB This paper presents some findings related to the experience of developing and deploying an software application aimed at using remote experimentation with mobile devices and the use of Virtual Learning Environments (VLE) as tools to support teaching and learning. Currently the technological resources have been misused in education, and the potential use of mobile devices in education is virtually untapped. The architecture implemented enables the users to control real experiments and to monitor results via video streaming, which provides a sense of involvement similar to hands-on laboratories. The authors describe the deployment of this mobile learning tool in a second year Brazilian public high school. The mobile application uses HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery Mobile in order to maintain compatibility among the platforms widely used. The VLE Moodle has been used in order to provide homework, assignments and teaching material. The experiments have been automated using open hardware and software sources, which facilitate replication in different areas.

AB The data centre at the Galician Institute of High Energy Physics (IGFAE) of the Santiago de Compostela University (USC) is a computing cluster with about 150 nodes and 1250 cores that hosts the LHCb Tiers 2 and 3. In this small data centre, and of course in similar or bigger ones, it is very important to keep optimal conditions of temperature, humidity and pressure. Therefore, it is a necessity to monitor the environment and be able to trigger alarms when operating outside the recommended settings.
   There are currently many tools and systems developed for data centre monitoring, but until recent years all of them were of commercial nature and expensive. In recent years there has been an increasing interest in the use of technologies based on Arduino due to its open hardware licensing and the low cost of this type of components. In this article we describe the system developed to monitor IGFAE's data centre, which integrates an Arduino controlled sensor network with the Nagios monitoring software. Sensors of several types, temperature, humidity and pressure, are connected to the Arduino board. The Nagios software is in charge of monitoring the various sensors and, with the help of Nagiosgraph, to keep track of the historic data and to produce the plots. An Arduino program, developed in house, provides the Nagios plugin with the readout of one or several sensors depending on the plugin's request. The Nagios plugin for reading the temperature sensors also broadcasts an SNMP trap when the temperature gets out of the allowed operating range.

AB The developing world remains plagued by lack of access to safe drinking water. Although many low-cost methods have been developed to treat contaminated water, low-cost methods for water-quality testing are necessary to determine if these appropriate technologies are needed, effective, and reliable. This paper provides a methodology for the design, development, and technical validation of a low-cost, open-source (OS) water testing platform. A case study is presented where the platform is developed to provide both the colorimetry for biochemical oxygen demand/chemical oxygen demand and nephelometry to measure turbidity using method ISO 7027. This approach resulted in equipment that is as accurate, but costs between 7.5 and 15 times less than current commercially available tools. It is concluded that OS hardware development is a promising solution for the equipment necessary to perform water quality measurements in both developed and developing regions.

AB Gas chromatography (GC) is frequently used in qualitative and quantitative analysis of volatile organic molecules. In its most common embodiment, samples are prepared in the laboratory, and injected into the capillary column using an autosampler. Analytes are separated, and detected by one of several available detection systems, including mass spectrometry (MS). However, this mode of operation is not convenient when monitoring dynamic chemical systems - for example, reaction mixtures. Here we present a facile approach for automated sampling, and subsequent introduction of samples to a GC apparatus in order to enable monitoring of dynamic chemical processes in real time. The proposed system incorporates two pinch valves, a peristaltic pump, a thermoshaker, and an electronic control unit (Raspberry Pi microcomputer) with several relays. The device facilitates dosing small volumes of liquid samples to the injection port of a commercial GC-MS apparatus. A program in C language controls the operation of the pump (on/off, direction of flow) and actuation of the pinch valves, and it initiates GC-MS runs. The system has been characterised with artificial samples, and successfully used in the monitoring of transesterification reactions catalysed by single microbeads containing immobilised lipase, as well as in the monitoring of the extraction of natural products from plant tissue samples. We believe that - following further improvements - this automated approach may be adapted for monitoring industrial processes and environmental analysis.

AB We describe an 'open' design methodology for wide-field fluorescence, confocal and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), and how the resulting microscopes are being applied to radiation biology and protein activity studies in cells and human tissue biopsies. The design approach allows easy expansion as it moves away from the use of a monolithic microscope body to small, commercial off-the-shelf and custom made modular components. Details have been made available under an open license for non-commercial use at http://users.ox.ac.uk/similar to atdgroup.
   Two radiobiology 'end-stations' have been constructed which enable fast radiation targeting and imaging of biological material opening up completely novel studies, where the consequences of ionising radiation (signaling and protein recruitment) can be studied in situ, at short times following irradiation. One is located at Surrey University, UK, where radiation is a highly focused in beam (e.g. protons, helium or higher mass ions). The second is installed at the Gray Institute linear accelerator facility, Oxford University, which uses sub-microsecond pulses of 6 MeV electrons.
   FLIM capabilities have enhanced the study of protein-protein interactions in cells and tissues via Frster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). Extracting FRET signals from breast cancer tissue is challenging because of endogenous and fixation fluorescence; we are investigating novel techniques to measure this robustly. Information on specific protein interactions from large numbers of patient tumors will reveal prognostic and diagnostic information.

AB Background. Breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy often experience a loss of quality of life. Moreover chemotherapy may induce neutropenia. Patients report a better quality of life when additionally treated with mistletoe products during chemotherapy. Methods. In this prospective randomized open-label pilot study 95 patients were randomized into three groups. All patients were treated with an adjuvant chemotherapy. The primary objective of the study was quality of life, the secondary objective was neutropenia. Here we report the comparison of HxA (n = 34) versus untreated control (n = 31). Results. In the explorative analysis ten of 15 scores of the EORTC QLQ-C30 showed a better quality of life in the HxA group compared to the control group (P < 0.001 to P = 0.038 in Dunnett-T3 test). The difference was clinically relevant (difference of at least 5 points, range 5.4-12.2) in eight of the ten scores. Neutropenia occurred in 7/34 HxA patients and in 8/31 control patients (P = 0.628). Conclusions. This pilot study showed an improvement of quality of life by treating breast cancer patients with HxA additionally to CAF. Although the open design may be a limitation, the findings show the feasibility of a confirmatory study using the methods described here.

AB Background: Propofol is often used as an anesthetic agent for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). In recent studies, propofol was shown to possess significant seizure-shortening properties during ECT. "Valproate" is a mood stabilizer used mainly in the treatment of bipolar affective disorder. It is reported that valproate, being an anticonvulsant, raises the seizure threshold, thus decreases the efficacy of ECT treatment.
   Aim: The purpose of our study was to compare the dose of propofol in valproate-using patients and valproate-free patients.
   Methods: In an open design, 17 patients with bipolar affective disorder manic episodes who were to be treated with valproate and ECT in combination, were compared with 16 manic-episode patients who were to be treated with ECT but not valproate. The two groups were compared on the basis of electroencephalography-registered seizure duration and the propofol dosage required to induce anesthesia.
   Results: Valproate, compared with no valproate treatment, results in a decrease in the propofol dose required to induce anesthesia. In the valproate group of study participants, seizure duration was significantly shorter than in the valproate-free group.
   Conclusion: The results suggest that valproate reduces the dose of propofol required for anesthesia during ECT treatment in patients with bipolar affective disorder manic episodes. Although propofol is a safe and efficacious anesthetic for ECT treatment, lower doses of propofol should be used to induce anesthesia for patients under valproate treatment. When the clinician needs to prolong seizure duration in patients treated with valproate, interruption of the valproate treatment or an anesthetic agent other than propofol should be considered.

AB Ruairi Glynn, lecturer on interactive architecture at the Bartlett School ofArchitecture, University College London (UCL), puts the pressing question: What does a world of hyper-connective, high-definition sensing offer architectural design?' Despite the pervasiveness of ubiquitous computing - the Internet of Things (IoT) - and students' ability to speculate, build and test responsive lifesize installations, could practice itself be in danger of getting left behind?.

AB In the open hardware graphics accelerator (ORGFX), there are rectangle, line, triangle and curve rasterization modules. This paper is only focused on the improvement of line rasterization speed. Besides modifying the algorithm itself, hardware implementation and resource consumption are put into consideration here. Originally, ORGFX uses the classic Bresenham line algorithm with high precision and simple logic to rasterize lines, but this algorithm can only generate one pixel in each rasterization process, which results in efficiency relatively low. New algorithm in this paper combines Bresenham algorithm with the symmetry nature of lines, advantages of Bresenham algorithm are kept and rasterization speed is improved in this way. The results of experiments show that nearly 50 percent of time can be saved through software implementation and hardware implementation.

AB This paper presents a novel Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) linear actuator and its application driving the joints of an anthropomorphic robotic hand. Its main feature is that it is a flexible SMA actuator, it is designed so that it can be bent. The possibility of bending the actuator while preserving its capacity to produce a linear movement allows to use very long SMA wires, able to yield a great linear displacement, in a confined space. This feature provides better integration and adaptability than other existing high-displacement SMA actuators. The mechanical design of the presented SMA flexible actuator is based on the Bowden cable transmission system, using a multilayer sheath with a PTFE inner sheath to reduce friction losses and a stainless steel outer sheath that functions as a heat sink to reduce the cooling time of the SMA element. To test the SMA actuator with a real device, a robotic hand has been built using low cost rapid prototyping techniques from an open source design. The designed flexible SMA actuator has a great potential to be used in humanoid robots or robotic prostheses, due to its adaptability, output force, low weight and silent operation.

AB In this paper we discuss the motivation and challenges raised by the desire to consider the morphology as an experimental variable on real robotic platforms as well as allowing reproducibility and diffusion in the scientific community. In this context, we present an alternative design and production methodology that we have applied to the conception of Poppy, the first complete 3D printed open-source and open-hardware humanoid robot. Robust and accessible, it allows exploring quickly and easily the fabrication, the programming and the experimentation of various robotic morphologies. Both hardware and software are open-source, and a web platform allows interdisciplinary contributions, sharing and collaborations. Finally we conduct an experiment to explore the impact of four different foot morphologies on the robot's dynamic when it makes a footstep. We show that such experimentation can easily be achieved and shared in couple of days at almost no cost.

AB Power wheelchairs have high costs in developing countries, making its access difficult to the physically impaired, its main target audience, and to groups that develop assistive technologies, such as researchers, independent developers and entrepreneurs. Free software and open hardware have been successfully used to bridge access gap in areas where cost was a problem, democratizing the innovation process. This paper presents an open hardware and software platform developed for power wheelchairs, which aims to contribute to research and development in this area and stimulate local industry to implement affordable assistive technologies. We believe this work can be used as model for future research on open electronics platforms.

AB The prime objective of any technological innovation is to improve the life of people. Technological innovation in the field of medical devices directly touches the lives of millions of people; not just patients but doctors and other technicians as well. Serving these care givers is serving humanity. Growth of Mobil Devices and Cloud Computing has changed the way we live and work. We try to bring the benefits of these technological innovations to the medical field via equipment which can improve the working efficiencies and capabilities of the medical professionals and technicians. The improvements in the camera and image processing capabilities of the Mobile Devices coupled with their improved processing power and an infinite processing and storage offered by Cloud Computing infrastructure opens up a window of opportunity to use them in the specialized field like microsurgery. To enable microsurgery, surgeons use optical microscope to zoom into the working area to get better visibility and control. However, these devices suffer from various drawbacks and are not comfortable to use. We build a Tablet with large stereoscopic screen allowing glasses free 3D display enabled by cameras capable of capturing 3D video and enhanced by an image processing pipeline, greatly improves the visibility and viewing comfort of the surgeon. Moreover using the capabilities of Cloud computing, these surgeries can be recorded and streamed live for education, training and consultation. An expert sitting in a geographically remote location can guide the surgeon performing the surgery. All vital parameters of the patient undergoing surgery can be shown as an overlay on the Tablet screen so that the surgeon is alerted of any parameter going beyond limit. Developing this kind of complex device involves engineering skills in hardware and software and huge amount of investments in terms of time, resources and money. To accelerate the development, we make use of open source hardware and software and demonstrate how we can accelerate the development using these open source resources.

AB The effective management of several distributed devices, even in real time, is one of the mandatory conditions for the design, operation and upgrade of modern particle accelerators control systems. In order to cope with the performance demanded by such plants, the existing equipment has to be continuously improved or new strategies have to be considered to overcome its limitations. The impressive capability growth of mobile and handheld devices allows moving from a traditional distributed architecture, based on complex and expensive operating nodes, to a pervasive approach based on simple and cheap embedded systems, tailored for each specific application. Such pervasive trend is further favored by the open design approach, which is becoming more and more popular as it enables designers to easily adapt an already existing board to their specific needs. In this communication a brief description of Elettra and FERMI light sources in the context of controls, diagnostics and power supplies is given. The main applications developed and successfully deployed on the accelerators and based on a commercial open design embedded board are also presented.

AB The role of design based STEM education is to foster and develop a range of transferable skills, values and knowledge which will be appropriate in solving problems (1).
   Conventionally, these skills are promoted through design based learning tasks where students conceive, create and communicate their solutions to the problems posed 2. Promoting a linear approach to a task which is dynamic and fluid stifles the creative ingenuity of students and presents unauthentic evidence of the design process 3. In developing higher order thinking skills, through the design task, students are encouraged to record their design evolution primarily for the purpose of assessment.
   A stratified sample (n=15) was taken from a cohort of first year undergraduate students enrolled on a four year initial technology teacher education programme. The study investigates the beliefs and values held by the students regarding the value they place on learning through design and the value they place on the stages of the design process. Students created their own personal conception of a theoretical framework that captured the stages and functions of their personal design journey. The frameworks were modelled by students, based on their beliefs pre and post their engagement in a semi-open design based task. The results presented highlight a shift in the value placed on the process of learning through design from students' initial understanding and their experience of designing following their engagement in the design task.

AB The rapid advancement of low cost embedded systems invites engineering educators to deliver content and skills while engaging students in hands-on projects that may potentially make use of a variety of platforms. From proprietary to open source hardware and software, from microcontrollers to embedded operating systems (OS) devices, students today are challenged to accelerate their learning pace by working on real-world projects in a supervised environment. Currently, students rely on self-guidance in order to develop the knowledge base necessary for achieving the goals of their team projects with respect to embedded systems. This paper presents the results of an embedded systems programming tutorial piloted with a group of 15 undergraduate students from across the engineering disciplines and with a mix of sophomores through seniors. The tutorial included a series of three lecture modules prepared to introduce concepts on embedded systems. The modules were tightly coupled with hands-on exercises that employed the DE2i-150 development board, aimed to introduce students to the development of digital systems based on an Altera field programmable gate array (FPGA) in conjunction with an Linux-based embedded OS running on an Intel Atom processor. The first module provides an overview of the various inputs, outputs, sensors, and displays of the board. The second module introduces the embedded OS and guides students in establishing a high-speed Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) link between the Atom processor and the FPGA. The third module focuses on implementing a custom C/++ application written by students for real-time processing of inputs from four push buttons. Results show that the three lecture modules of 30 minutes each, coupled with the hands-on projects, offer a good introduction to the complexity of the DE2i-150 board. Surveys collected before the first module and after the third show a generally positive outcome. Recommendations for future efforts focus on incorporating more complex C/++ applications concurrent with FPGA development.

AB In teaching undergraduate automatic controls, the laboratory experience is an important and irreplaceable component. Historically, good platforms for a controls laboratory have been expensive, because the equipment has typically been very specialized for educational purposes. Moreover, the equipment often is not physically robust in the face of student manhandling, creating major difficulties and costs in maintaining such a lab. The advent of inexpensive open-source controller hardware is revolutionizing this situation because it is now possible to have good controls-hardware capability at relatively low cost. The Arduino Mega 2560, in particular, is supported by Matlab, Simulink and LabView, and thus provides a great deal of flexibility in developing laboratory procedures for students to study controls.
   The Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. The "motor shield" is an add-on (daughterboard) to the Arduino that further enables control of dc motors. This paper explains a method and hardware to connect an Arduino to a separately-powered dc-motor unit. Matlab and Simulink provide full support of the Arduino board for feedback-controller design. The Arduino board is powered by, and communicates with Simulink, through a standard USB connection.

AB This paper explains the implementation of a low cost, non-intrusive home energy monitoring system. The design implementation of the proof of concept employs open-source hardware architecture using Arduino and off-the-shelf sensors which lends itself to mass production, low cost and easy maintenance. This system is intended to service rural and low income urban consumers who will not be able to afford existing sophisticated and expensive home automation systems. A device identification module (DIM) that recognizes the devices in use at every room is implemented. The energy usage is continuously monitored and the user is notified of his consumption over a twenty four hour period. As many of the intended users are possible first time energy consumers, the energy monitoring system will inculcate a sense of energy consciousness and ensure grass root level sustainability. The energy consumption data is logged in the system and can be used by the utility service provider (USP) for future system planning, optimization and demand side management. The proof of concept developed and tested under laboratory conditions costs under USD 11 and will reduce further on commercialization.

AB This paper presents a new methodology proposal and hands-on activities in the Introduction to Computer Engineering (ICE) course, based on open hardware platforms. The proposal has been adopted in the Computer Engineering undergraduate program at the Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul (UFMS) - Brazil. Most of the ICE courses from computer engineering programs around the world have put focus on teaching initial basic theoretical concepts of algorithms, logic, and digital systems. The ICE course at UFMS has been organized to encompass from initial basic concepts up to a practical and motivating set of experimental activities in order to clarify the program focus and to connect the concepts to practical applications. To evaluate the impacts of this new curriculum and methodology, an online anonymous survey has been carried out with students from 2011, 2012, and 2013 classes. After a statistical analysis and validation of the answers, 28% of the students have pointed that the activities have been determinant to increase their motivation to study computer engineering. The impacts on students motivation, since the first semester, have been observed in the students evasion rate. The percentage of evasions in the computer engineering is less than other engineering programs at UFMS.

AB This work presents a script-based development environment aimed at allowing users to easily design and create mechanical bodies for folded plastic robots. The origami-inspired fabrication process is inexpensive and widely accessible, and the tools developed in this work allow for open source design sharing and modular reuse. Designs are generated by recursively combining mechanical components - from primitive building blocks, through mechanisms and assemblies, to full robots - in a flexible yet well-defined manner. This process was used to design robotic elements of increasing complexity up to a multi-degree-of-freedom compliant manipulator arm, demonstrating the power of this system. The developed system is extensible, opening avenues for further research ultimately leading to the development of a complete robot compiler.

AB We present a telerobotics research platform that provides complete access to all levels of control via open-source electronics and software. The electronics employs an FPGA to enable a centralized computation and distributed I/O architecture in which all control computations are implemented in a familiar development environment (Linux PC) and low-latency I/O is performed over an IEEE-1394a (FireWire) bus at speeds up to 400 Mbits/sec. The mechanical components are obtained from retired first-generation da Vinci (R) Surgical Systems. This system is currently installed at 11 research institutions, with additional installations underway, thereby creating a research community around a common open-source hardware and software platform.

AB The idea is to develop new RFID smart tag sensors to be used in a monitoring service assisted by ICT platform to monitor fresh produce quality. It is based on a smart gas sensor and consists of a commercial fork of open hardware, on which we assembly an array of commercial sensors suitable for air quality monitoring. In particular, to measure ethylene (ripening marker) a class of unspecific metal oxide commercial sensors has been selected and tested, in controlled environment, to probe the response capability to extremely low gas concentration (less than tens ppm). Firmware implemented uses a power management strategy to minimize device consumption. It is able to save locally raw data and transmit, on request, an index correlated to the vegetable ripening. The index results from a mathematical model based on time-integral function depending on the vegetable transport parameters, temperature, humidity and gas sensor outputs. Work in progress deals to optimize the algorithm and mathematical model implemented in device with Onsite experimentation.

AB In the recent years technology education has gained importance worldwide. Colombian government has included it in the basic and secondary schools curriculum, but the current teaching-learning strategies and the resources used for technology class have proven to be insufficient. This paper presents a case study for implementing Project-Based learning in a Colombian high school, using Open source Hardware and Software. First, a set of technological competencies are defined for technology class, based on the suggestions of the Ministry of National Education. Then, a project for designing an irrigation system for the school orchard is presented, which will engage students to develop the selected technological competencies. Subsequently, a set of didactic tools for the project are presented, including an electronic platform for the control of the water flux in the irrigation system. The project will be implemented during the following months, and through diagnostic and summative assessment it is expected to measure the improvement of the technological competencies in students.

AB This paper demonstrates the use of open source hardware and software to implement the digital back end of a network of radars. i.e. RHINO platform - a highly capable reconfigurable platform serving both digitisation / synthesis and packetisation functions for a dual X and L band radar. The system is capable of arbitrary waveform generation for transmit, and can be configured at runtime and reprogrammed in the field if required. Two digitisation cards (FMC format) are used to capture the X and L band receive signals, and a DAC is used for waveform synthesis. The digital back end bandpass samples to lower both sample and data rates, and streams data to a processing back-end over a 1GBe link. The work shown here concentrates on this implementation, and highlights the current and expected performance for each subsystem.

AB This paper presents the state-of-the-art for building a low cost mobile robot with open-source technology based on sensor fusion. Designing open-source educational robots has a great impact on empowering engineers and those interested in mobile robots. In the last decade, different robots have been designed and built for this purpose. In this project, with the help of sensors available on a 9-axis open-source IMU and a robot based on open-source hardware and control software, a graphical user interface has been implemented to view the condition of motion variables in a real-time manner and combine sensor data. Moreover, by implementing different filter programs, such as low-pass filter, complementary filter and by using KF implementation and deliberation this mobile robot becomes suitable for improving the accuracy of the robot in extracting parameters required for localization, mapping and robot navigation. Features of the developed robot, the so-called TL-OSR, can be regarded as: using open-source hardware and software with real-time performance, low price equipment, presenting a solution based on sensor fusion for better accuracy in robot navigation and using different types of sensors. This robot can be used as an suitable open-source platform as a new class of mobile robots for educational and research purposes in mechatronics and robotics.

AB Computer numerical control (CNC) machines play a central role in modern manufacturing. CNC machining skills provide high-paying manufacturing jobs to graduates of engineering and technology. Hands-on laboratory instruction is essential for effective student learning in the area of CAD/CAM/Manufacturing Technology, but the high cost of commercial and even educational CNC machines like mills and lathes constrains the scope of instruction in CNC machining. In this paper, an inexpensive two-axis lathe prototype is developed using off-the-shelf materials and components, open source hardware, and open source CAM and CNC software. The machine can be adapted for large scale use in engineering colleges, polytechnics, and industrial training institutes (ITIs). To make the CNC learning even more affordable, accessible and less resource-intensive, a web-based learning platform for using the lathe is developed.

AB The OpenAirInterface (OAI) emulation platform is an effective tool to evaluate the performance of LTE and LTE-Advanced system, and test related algorithms and strategies. This platform aims at building a platform that is accuracy, repeatable and scalable. The complete features of OAI emulation platform are presented and the key technologies are introduced. In order to develop the platform for the further application, some new modules have been added and some validation of the platform has been provided. The emulation comes in two flavors: single machine mode and multi-machine mode. PHY abstraction with the core methodology of effective SINR mapping improves the platform's efficiency and the capability to build a large-scale emulation with multiple nodes. The key function random access and scheduling of MAC layer and the basic call procedure of the platform are provided. The validation results shown in this paper illustrate that the emulation platform is correctly operating and PHY abstraction reduce the emulation time significantly on the basis of accuracy. This emulation platform can be used to test, evaluate and validate of the real LTE system, and with the efficiency operation, it can be improved to support the system-level emulation of a large-scale LTE and LTE-A system.

AB This paper presents the design and implementation of an OpenRISC-based System-on-Chip (SoC), which is composed of hardware cores implementing the Digital Signal Processing (DSP) functions: Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter, Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filter and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The FIR-filter core is based on the transpose realization form, the IIR-filter core is based on the Second Order Sections (SOS) architecture and the FFT core is based on the Radix 2(2) Single Delay Feedback (R2(2) SDF) architecture. The three cores are compatible with the Wishbone SoC bus, and they were described using generic and structural VHDL. In-system hardware verification was performed by using an OpenRisc-based SoC synthesized on an Altera FPGA. Tests showed that the designed DSP cores are suitable for building SoC based on the OpenRisc processor and the Wishbone bus.

AB Mobile sensor networks are often composed of agents with weak processing capabilities and some means of mobility. However, recent developments in embedded systems have enabled more powerful and portable processing units capable of analyzing complex data streams in real time. Systems with such capabilities are able to perform tasks such as 3D visual localization and tracking of targets. They are also well-suited for environmental monitoring using a combination of cameras, microphones, and sensors for temperature, air-quality, and pressure. Still there are few compact platforms that combine state of the art hardware with accessible software, an open source design, and an affordable price. In this paper, we present an in-depth comparison of several mobile distributed sensor network platforms, and we introduce the WolfBot platform which offers a balance between capabilities, accessibility, cost and an open-design. Experiments analyzing its computer-vision capabilities, power consumption, and system integration are provided.

AB The paper presents a course that introduces Architecture students to product design, materials, techniques and fabrication processes. The course uses a combination of digital fabrication tools and parametric design software - a combination often cited as "Open design". It also uses a rapid prototyping laboratory which among other things facilitates the transition from design to the actual product. Designing a chair is under a certain perspective no different than designing a building. There is a different context, different constraints but both are essentially design processes involving craft, geometry, materiality, function, structure and fabrication. The fusion between the disciplines of Architecture and Product Design attempted in this 4th year course focuses in a way of making architecture where the process of construction is as important as the form itself. A paradox is then created: by using the most advanced technological tools, the act of building is conceptually closer to its primitive form. The architect is also a craftsman, able to shape matter with his own tools. The paper presents the core theory behind the course and the results during its 4 year long history within the curriculum of an Architecture School.

AB We have detected a great gap between teaching of structural mechanics and the real world applications related with this subject. The European Space of Higher Education requires a higher proportion of practical content in courses, so that students can develop skills to solve real problems in the development of their professional practice. Therefore, we have the challenge of develop new laboratory practices to reduce the gap between theoretical contents of the classes and the aforementioned real world applications.
   When we faced with this problem, we realized that usual commercial equipments for educational laboratories are quite limited in flexibility and are often quite expensive. In this work we show how we have implemented the practices for a structural mechanics course in the second year of civil engineering studies using open hardware solutions. For this purpose we built our own devices and involved students from different courses and specialties, including undergraduate researchers in the development of the different mechanical and electronic components. The main aim of the present work has been the creation of a self-teaching experience for students, where they can freely build the models, interact with the sensors and check the correlation between the theoretical models and the practical results.

AB Robotics teaching is nowadays limited by the expensiveness of the electronic material required. In this paper, a new low-cost, user friendly robotic system has been developed. This system provides an advanced mobile robotics teaching frame using cheap hardware and software resources. This platform consists on a little mobile robot able to navigate through the environment avoiding obstacles and performing a map of its surrounding. This system performs these tasks using open hardware and software tools. The robot, made from an Arduino board, cheap sensors, motors and wheels, has been programmed using C++ language on Arduino and ROS. The system communicates in real time with a PC where the map is drawn using OpenCV libraries.
   Regarding to the hardware, the robot has the structure of a PopBot-168 Arduino kit, which consists of a circular structure and two motors connected to their corresponding wheels. The robot also has two encoders and a magnetometer to perform location task. The processor is an Arduino Mega board. The system features two infrared sensors that get the distances of robot's environment in every directions due to a servomotor that moves them.
   The developed robot is able to perform a map of its environment and draw it in a computer. The communication between the robot and the computer is performed using ROS. This project has managed to introduce a ROS node on the Arduino board. In the computer there are another two nodes, one for draw the map and another which decide where to move.
   Finally, as experimental results, an example of how the robot works building a 2-dimensional reconstruction from an environment is shown. Students can learn about the problem of auto-location and other difficulties due to robotics itself. It is also a very good mechanism to learn from the beginning to design, assemble and program a mobile robot; use and gather data from the sensors.

From the study of iPads as springboard, it keeps redefining new disciplinary and academic literacies to stay abreast of change. Recent research shows contrary to common view that youth are digital natives, experienced and willing to adopt new technology as they encounter problems when required to walk on areas of higher-level thinking. They just keep to superficial levels of usage instead. The challenge to education is greater now that life and learning are multi-dimensional, multi-modal and distributed.
   This is particularly visible in fields that require making artefacts and innovation instead of using technology passively. For instance, industrial design was traditionally thought to assist increasing production and consumption through mechanical or process innovation. The profession leans on a long legacy of craftsmanship and making. However old-style constraints and measures of success seem to be challenged by recent developments in technology.
   This presentation extends on new digital technologies as they are also impacting the material culture of design. The advent of a new incarnation of makers, initially represented by affordable 3D rapid prototyping and associated software, has brought about the need to query the profession. There are a number of societal and cultural implications affecting our designers' role as change makers. Technology is delivering cheaper and more efficient devices and communication. Democratization on means of production is on the increase and designers cannot longer claim control by positioning themselves as the expert elite who provides stylish services to a mass of consumers in a naive market. Learning from history, graphic design and desktop publishing were greatly affected when computing industry expanded into a new niche of home market back in 1990s. Additionally, globalisation increased competition when cheaper services based on lower labour costs were offered from elsewhere. Now technology is also forcing similar changes in industrial design.
   Many design courses focus on design thinking while still falling short from reflecting current professional circumstances. They still need to overcome the paradox of preparing creative "world-class subject-matter experts who too often lack commercial aptitude,' 'graduates often have little or no idea of how a company works, and how they could fit in. The cost: too many great technological ideas are squandered as their creators have little to no idea how to express their inventions". It is said designers have difficulty on breaking away from isolationism and lack of analysis, contextual and historical inquiry, abstraction and theory, writing and reading, process thinking, understanding of science, etc. The author proposes a framework of " makers-thinkers-enactors-enablers" for a new breed of designers. A new design discourse that considers
   First, previous boundaries that are now blurred.
   Second, how constrains and freedoms are shifting places.
   Third, the act of extended creation between designers and users in a process of co-making and open design. Examples on methodology and implementation of that framework are provided to grow design expertise from traditional skillsets onto new competencies for the new age.
   The paper also moves onto recommendations on transformative framework development based on a current course renewal in process of implementation.

DE Design education; Creativity; Meaning Making; Radical Innovation;
   Incremental Innovation; Co-design
AB A lot has been written about artists and designers fate to lead society onto new levels of development and progress. Kandinsky proclaimed them at the top in a "dictatorship" of artistic and design "illuminate through consensus and taste". A century later, Paula Antonelli (2009) mentioned designers are expected to become "the reference point for policy makers", "the intellectuals of the future", and "the culture generators". These statements represent two of three challenges to modern designers for analysis in this paper. They are neither well trained on policy nor on cultural studies. The third test to consider is coming from design innovation and its management. As per Norman (2010), there is an increasing demand for designers to move on from acting by assumption and naive psychology relating to human behaviour onto informed knowledge management, appropriate design based research and theory. Norman and Verganti (2011) agree, both incremental and radical innovations depend on designers' capacity to figure out complex projects through co-designed production and carrying meaning for their users. Consequentially they invite others to expand the still uncharted waters of product design, its management, meaning making, and the link and role for designers between technology and culture. This paper extends on their work by bringing to attention new circumstances for product meaning from areas of language, culture and creativity. First, an explanation on how products may carry meaning however they may not be meaningful, as they do not reach a status of appropriate immersion and significance according to a socio-cultural context. The advance of digital technology is increasing carry-meaning alternatives. Today, typical industrial design products may become significant by their intangible component, experience and value instead of its materiality. Designers need to rethink their position to be key cultural intermediaries, gatekeepers of innovation and producers of symbolic goods and services for society. Second, the paper proposes traditional grouping of players on either side of the camp, production or consumption, is no longer sufficient. A new digital native generation is coming to age in an era of improved access to information such as MOOCs, open source and design. Co-design and production are already modifying to show end users participation in design and production as sign of a more democratic and pluralistic process. An indication of this change appeared in fine arts first, from Breton and his experiments on language and communication (Exquisite Corpse, 1928) to Happenings by Duchamp (1930), Kaprow (1959) and others. More recently, production of meaning can also be linked to user participatory architecture, design for social innovation, and bottom up innovation, flash mobs, hacking spaces, and open source design and maker culture. Third, educational institutions and industry will also have to change and accommodate their business models to a more diverse division of labour and production, policy and funding structure. The capacity to adapt to this new context should allow them to progress through radical random and/or directed iterations of technology as well as enabling them to modify and lead socio-cultural change.

AB Wireless Sensor Networks is a growing research field and often researchers use a development platform to implement their experimental ideas and protocols. Wireless sensor network development boards provide interfaces to hardware, radios, real time operating systems, and routing protocols, allowing quick implementation of ideas. However, the selection of WSN development boards available is limited, and sometimes, depending on the popularity of the platform, support and resources are scarce. In this paper, a development platform design is presented, which employs commonly used and widely supported open source hardware and software. The board is also designed to use standard hardware interfaces to make adding additional sensors an easy task.

AB "Music education is, in its nature, human and essentially serves to awaken and develop human capacities." This phrase by Edgar Willems (1890-1978) serves as a starting point in the design, implementation, tuning and validation of a digital interface for teaching and musical creation with children from 3 years old, visually impaired or affected by Autism Spectrum Disorders. The values of illustrated society advocate the access to knowledge for people on equal conditions. Our own public and private education system is based on the merit declaring the equality of citizens. The main aim of our technological proposal is to demonstrate in the practice that the inclusion of students with visual impairment or autism spectrum disorders in the music room, both in schools and conservatories, is positively feasible through curricular changes and using some resources that optimize the inclusion. And in this process, the teacher is a fundamental key part of the educational inclusion. Teachers should have the tools, based on traditional and new technologies, which will help them facilitate and enhance and improve their task results. The design and operation of the interface, which allows the generation and combination of sounds in real time according to the movements made by the student, is based on an open hardware platform and on an open software development environment. These ensure, from the beginning, a cheap interface and make it available to the educational community a tool that could use and improve, if deemed, its performance according to their own needs.

AB With today's rapid development of technology, software research and development has examined various input modalities for interactive systems. Pervasive and Physical computing have a great demand in both the market and education. The need for creating interfaces that acquire data from users and their environment, has led to proliferation of interest in ubiquitous computing and more innovative solutions. In this paper, we describe the design and delivery of a training workshop that was developed for academics with Information Technology background; the key objective of this workshop's training, was to introduce them to concepts related to physical computing and spark their interest in broadening the scope of computing background for them and their students. The workshop features the Arduino UNO micro-controller since it is a cross platform, open source, and open hardware. Also, due to the fact it's low-cost, flexibility, and simplicity. The sessions covered topics of how to build a circuit, program an Arduino, demonstrate the (IC)-C-2 protocol and establish a serial communication. Twenty-two participants took part in the workshop sessions and two instructors were involved in running the sessions. Insights obtained from conducting the sessions and feedback from participants are synthesized and discussed. Implications for training related to introducing physical computing to IT contexts of learning are described.

AB Impaired gait can be restored to its physiological level using wearable robotic systems acting alongside human lower limbs and providing assistive forces that adapt to the residual sensory-motor capabilities of the wearer. Such systems can be used as assistive aids (to overcome disabilities or age-related impairments) or as rehabilitation tools (to restore physical and neurological abilities through proper training). In order to elicit physiological gait as a behavior emerging from the interaction between the robot and the user, the robot morphology must be considered as an open design variable, thus relaxing the constraint of using basically anthropomorphic architectures. This chapter deals with several design aspects related to this approach for the development of lower limbs wearable robots. In particular, it analyzes kinematic compatibility issues, possible topological connections among robotic elements, morphological optimization of robot properties, actuation solutions with series compliance, interaction control schemes and user's intention detection strategies. Pilot tests on a novel non-anthropomorphic device, developed according to the proposed approach, are presented as a case-study, exemplifying the main design aspects described within the chapter.

AB According to Hod Lipson at Cornell University's Creative Machines Lab, cloud manufacturing 'consists of a network of small-scale, decentralized nodes of production.' It is a novel production approach relative to centralized mass production and standardisation methods common to today's industrial processes. To date, cloud manufacturing techniques have focused largely on the production of small-scale consumer goods that integrate digital fabrication techniques, the most popular being 3D-printing technology. With advances in network-based design platforms for 3D-printing services in combination with the global installation of fabrication laboratories (fab lab), the production of architectural building components using cloud manufacturing techniques is now possible. This paper will define how cloud manufacturing techniques can be expanded into the realm of architectural practice and, in particular, how such techniques can be applied to larger-scale building and construction components. The paper will further discuss how such novel additive manufacturing (AM) processes applied to construction can potentially revolutionize architectural design by generating a new collaborative design model that facilitates local production of customized and readily assembled building components on demand.

AB Although the research on the design of heterogeneous concurrent systems has a long and rich history, a unified design methodology and tool support have not emerged so far. Therefore, the creation of such systems remains a difficult, time-consuming and error-prone process. The absence of principled support for system evaluation and optimization at high level of abstraction makes the quality of the resulting implementation strongly dependent on the experience or individual preferences of the designer. In this work we are presenting TURNUS, a unified dataflow design space exploration framework for heterogeneous parallel systems. This open source framework represents a decade of research on high-level modelling and simulation methods and tools for system level performance estimation and optimization. Last year we presented heuristic algorithms that were focused on the results of exploration in terms of algorithmic optimization, rapid performance estimation, application throughput, buffer size dimensioning and power optimization. This year we are presenting the novelties that have been introduced in TURNUS such as clock gating, pipelining optimization, kernel splitting algorithms, advanced partitioning algorithms and scheduling optimization based on model predictive control techniques.

AB This paper details the implementation of a low-cost, open hardware, cloud-based intelligent farm automation system. Physical parameters such as soil moisture, temperature and humidity are measured by employing sensors sited across the monitored area. The parametric data is transmitted to the Atmel ATmega328P microcontroller from the sensors using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The cloud performs real time intelligence operations based on periodic sensor inputs obtained from the farm and transmits control commands to the microcontroller. The novelty of the system lies in the use of BLE and in the intelligence provided by the cloud. The physically monitored, as well as virtually obtained parameters, at the cloud level allow intelligent command generation, facilitated by a data exchange system that leverages the existing telecom network prevalent in developing countries. Based on the cloud commands, the ATmega328P microcontroller controls the operation time period of the irrigation system thus conserving both water and energy. The approximate cost of implementing the proof of concept system elaborated in this paper by using off the shelf components at retail price is about USD 16. It is expected that the system cost will further reduce on mass production and commercialization.

AB There have been many efforts to increase access and participation of indigenous communities in computer science education using ethnocomputing. In this paper, we extend culturally responsive computing by using electronic textiles that leverage traditional crafting and sewing practices to help students learn about engineering and computing as they also engage with local indigenous knowledges. Electronic textiles include sewable microcontrollers that can be connected to sensors and actuators by stitching circuits with conductive thread. We present findings from a junior high Native Arts class and an academically-oriented summer camp in which Native American youth ages 12-15 years created individual and collective e-textile designs using the LilyPad Arduino. In our discussion we address how a culturally responsive open design approach to ethnocomputing with e-textile activities can provide a productive but also challenging context for design agency and cultural connections for American Indian youth, and how these findings can inform the design of a broader range of introductory computational activities for all.

AB In this paper we present a technology assisted flat learning environment, Teaching to Learn (TeatoL), that capitalizes on the research findings on linkages between higher-order thinking and peer-learning. Within TeatoL students are introduced to a "flatter" instructional environment; all participants have dual roles as students and instructors who are embedded in a collaborative environment where all learn collectively from each other's experiences, even the instructor. The main objective of this paper is to understand flat learning environment as a social network. The focus is on peer learning mode, where students are instructors to share their experience and then learn from fellow student instructors. In this paper, we present our initial analysis of a flat learning environment, implemented at the University of Oklahoma, as a network. The participants in the learning environment were given an open design problem related to sheet metal forming. We close the paper with observations from our initial implementations on peer-learning as a network.

AB This paper presents a low-cost open source prototype of a gesture recognition and interpretation glove that aids audio-vocally impaired individuals in communication. A sensor based glove for recognition of the gestures in the American Sign Language (ASL) is the input module to the system. It incorporates resistive flex sensors and contact sensors appropriately positioned to obtain a theoretical efficiency of 96% in character recognition. When the sensors are subjected to change in orientation by the user, the variation in electrical resistance of each of the individual sensors is obtained as the input to an Arduino ATMega328 microcontroller that accurately maps it to the letters of the English alphabet through an efficient algorithm. An elegant methodology that is easy to implement using a microcontroller is employed for the mapping process to minimize the complexity of the system. The paper also presents a detailed study of the efficiency characteristics involved in the construction of the custom-designed flex sensors utilized in the system. The paper outlines the calibration and testing results of the sensors. The highlights of the system are its ergonomic and economical design, portability and intelligent gesture recognition and interpretation ability. The implemented system achieves a practical efficiency of up to 80% of theoretical efficiency. The cost of the system is approximately less than USD 5 at laboratory condition using off the shelf components.

TI BeamMaker: an open hardware high-resolution digital fabricator for the

SO RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE Innovation; Manufacturing systems; CAD; Rapid prototypes
AB Purpose - The democratization of invention is a long lasting desire for the advancement of society. Having access to education and the means of production appears as the major factors for the implementation of this goal. 3D printing is a revolutionary technology that has the potential to bring digital manufacturing to everyone. However, the rise of personal fabrication requires an increase in printing quality, a reduction on machine cost and an increase in knowledge shared by the open hardware community. The purpose of this paper is to explore the development of a new Open Hardware printer project to address these points.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors have designed and constructed a low-cost photopolymer-based 3D printer called BeamMaker. The printer is connected to a host computer and a digital-light-processing projector. This work details the design process and how improvements were implemented to reach good printing quality. The authors provide public access to the instructions, software, source code, parts list, user manual and STL and CAD files.
   Findings - The BeamMaker printer can build objects with a high surface quality that is comparable to the quality obtained by industrial photopolymer-based 3D printers. When testing the ability to print a sample cylinder, the printer shows higher accuracy when compared to other personal 3D printers. These findings are encouraging considering the low cost of the system.
   Research limitations/implications - The printing failure rate of the system has not been measured to date. The system requires some improvements to produce large objects.
   Practical implications - The printer cost is just USD380. This is five to eight times less expensive than popular personal 3D printers available today. The cost is 30 times less expensive than a personal photopolymer 3D printer produced by a main commercial company and yet producing results of similar quality. The authors expect good avenues for collaboration from the open-source community to continue improving these systems. Social implications - The high cost of current personal 3D printers prevents users from developing countries from entering into the open hardware trend. A dramatic reduction in printer cost such as that explored in this work might contribute to the real democratization of personal fabrication.
   Originality/value - The authors report on the status of three other photopolymer-based personal 3D printer projects. To the best of the authors' knowledge, BeamMaker is the first fully open hardware 3D printer project which uses this technology.

AB In this paper we explore the role of subjective well-being within the process of making together a personalized assistive device. Through a process of social product adaptation, assistive artifacts become part of occupational therapy and co-evolve with clients. Personal digital fabrication tools enable small user groups to make and share their one-of-a-kind products with the world. This approach opens up new possibilities for disabled people and their caregivers to actively engage with their own skills and challenges. The paper describes a case study of an inclusive participatory design approach, which leads to qualitative occupational experiences within the field of community-based practice. The aim is to show how the process of collaborative designing, making and using artifacts fosters several elements of subject well-being in itself. The starting point of this open design process is a threefold interaction involving industrial designers, patients and occupational therapists within their local product ecology. Co-experience driven design is an intersubjective process that enables all individual stakeholders to work on a common phenomenon in respect of each subjective experience. Participatory prototyping is applied as a mobilization medium that (a) coordinates and (b) motivates design actions towards collaborative well-being equilibriums. This form of artifact-mediated participatory design embodies simultaneously (1) a communication language between all stakeholders that identifies meaningful goals, (2) an explorative process to attain and challenge these goals, (3) a selection of meaningful and engaging prototyping activities and (4) an appropriateness process with local skills and technology. By implementing this creative process, disabled people and their carers become conscious actors in providing collaborative maintenance of their own physical, mental and social well-being.

AB CERN's accelerator control group has embraced "Open Hardware" (OH) to facilitate peer review, avoid vendor lock-in and make support tasks scalable. A web-based tool for easing collaborative work was set up and the CERN OH Licence was created. New ADC, TDC, fine delay and carrier cards based on VITA and PCI-SIG standards were designed and drivers for Linux were written. Often industry was paid for developments, while quality and documentation was controlled by CERN. An innovative timing network was also developed with the OH paradigm. Industry now sells and supports these designs that find their way into new fields.

AB This paper highlights the need for using specialised on-line collaborative environments by designers and product engineers who increasingly use Web 2.0 technology to search for information. Although there are professional channels and networks, there is no specific platform which helps during a new product's conceptualisation phase. Open communication must thus be promoted and encouraged amongst design professionals and companies to form working groups thereby allowing them to work collaboratively in the most open and creative phase of product design, i.e. conceptualisation. The OpenDesigNet (ODN) experimental platform has been developed so that designers and small- or medium-sized companies (SMC) can access on-line collaborative tools to support the creation and promotion of new on-line products and assess their immediate social impact. This article presents some of the results obtained during the validation phase involving a platform satisfaction survey of design engineering students and has led to a first-hand assessment of the new platform's potential impact on their professional future.

AB Since its inception in 19th-century Germany, the physiology laboratory has been a complex and expensive research enterprise involving experts in various fields of science and engineering. Physiology research has been critically dependent on cutting-edge technological support of mechanical, electrical, optical, and more recently computer engineers. Evolution of modern experimental equipment is constrained by lack of direct communication between the physiological community and industry producing this equipment. Fortunately, recent advances in open source technologies, including three-dimensional printing, open source hardware and software, present an exciting opportunity to bring the design and development of research instrumentation to the end user, i.e., life scientists. Here we provide an overview on how to develop customized, cost-effective experimental equipment for physiology laboratories.

AB With the recent development of the RepRap, an open-source self-replicating rapid prototyper, low-cost three-dimensional (3D) printing is now a technically viable form of distributed manufacturing of polymer-based products. However, the aggregate environmental benefits of distributed manufacturing are not clear due to scale reductions and the potential for increases in embodied energy. To quantify the environmental impact of distributed manufacturing using 3D printers, a life cycle analysis was performed on three plastic products. The embodied energy and emissions from conventional large-scale production in low-labor cost countries and shipping are compared to experimental measurements on a RepRap with and without solar photovoltaic (PV) power fabricating products with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA). The results indicate that the cumulative energy demand of manufacturing polymer products can be reduced by 41-64% (55-74% with PV) and concomitant emission reductions using distributed manufacturing with existing low-cost open-source 3D printers when using <25% fill PIA. Less pronounced positive environmental results are observed with ABS, which demands higher temperatures for the print bed and extruder. Overall, the results indicate that distributed manufacturing using open-source 3D printers has the potential to have a lower environmental impact than conventional manufacturing for a variety of products.

AB Print management solutions are necessary for organizations that need to monitor, report and charge printing or photocopying usage, especially in large domains where business goals require streamlined procedures. High-end print management systems offer integrated credit reception and efficient, parametrized accounting for the use of resources. The usage of printers and photocopy machines is controlled and monitored, and, through the latter, waste elimination is achieved. Print management inherently conforms with the rationale and mentality of green and eco-friendly technologies that also relate with the ethos of the open source movement in IT. One would expect that open source print management solutions would thrive; however, the vast majority of integrated management systems are commercial. There is only a small number of valuable open source print accounting solutions, but there are none that integrate accounting with a form of credit reception. This paper presents the design of an open system that integrates the provision of automated credit reception with accounting services in order to produce an open solution that fully automates the business process of print charging. The objective is to design the necessary automations for credit reception so that it can be realized without any human intervention, to plan the integration with a suitable open print accounting system and to specify any complementary utilities and tools necessary for production installations.

AB With embedded systems becoming ubiquitous, there is a growing need to teach and train engineers to be well-versed in their design and development. The multidisciplinary nature of such systems makes it challenging to give students exposure to and experience in all their facets. This paper proposes a generic architecture, containing multiple processors, that allows easy integration of custom and/or predefined peripherals. The architecture allows students to explore both the hardware and software issues associated with real-time and embedded systems. Furthermore, the architecture can be extended to train students in advanced concepts in embedded multiprocessor systems. This generic architecture has been used for two courses at the National University of Singapore-one on real-time embedded systems and the other emphasizing the hardware aspects of embedded systems. The project in the real-time embedded systems course has students develop a five-a-side soccer system on multiple field-programmable gate array (FPGA) boards using embedded processors. In the embedded hardware design course project, students use an embedded processor-based system to perform decryption of a block encrypted image, accelerated through a custom co-processor. The use of displays gives students a visual/interactive experience and a sense of accomplishment, while reinforcing the theoretical concepts. Both qualitative and quantitative assessment results are presented, showing how students perceived these projects and met the learning objectives.

DE White Rabbit protocol; Synchronous Ethernet PTP network timing; IEEE1577
AB The White Rabbit (WR) project is a multi-laboratory, multi-company effort to bring the best of the data transfer and the timing world together in a completely open design. WR is a fully deterministic Ethernet-based network for general purpose data transfer and synchronization. The aim is to enable the synchronization of a large number of nodes with sub-nanosecond accuracy and picosecond jitter over long lengths of fibre. The key technologies used are physical layer syntonization (clock recovery) and the Precision Time Protocol (IEEE 1588). WR generates sub-nanosecond synchronous precision timing in all nodes by continuous tracking and compensating the transmission delays. We give an overview of the WR project and describe the design goals and specifications of the project. The WR switch and the (user) node which are the central components of the WR system and real timing measurements of prototypes of WR hardware are presented. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB The ASDEX Upgrade tokamak went into operation in 1991 with a proposed lifetime of 10 years. Due to major modifications ASDEX Upgrade is still in operation. Infrastructure like data acquisition, workstations, etc. is being modernized, interfaces like RS-232 are vanishing and new interfaces are being introduced. This leads to the necessity to adapt old hardware. Most of the microcontrollers used in the old hardware do not offer any support of the new interfaces and have to be replaced. A simple and efficient way is to replace them with open hardware microcontroller boards like the Arduino. These boards are based on 8-bit RISC microcontrollers and offer a software development environment with a large number of libraries. In this paper the use of Arduino boards for replacing the position unit, the stub tuner interface and its use controlling a direct digital synthesizer (DDS) with phase control capability are shown.

AB An outstanding issue in graph-theoretical studies of brain functional connectivity is the lack of formal criteria for choosing parcellation granularity and correlation threshold. Here, we propose detectability of scale-freeness as a benchmark to evaluate time-series extraction settings. Scale-freeness, i.e., power-law distribution of node connections, is a fundamental topological property that is highly conserved across biological networks, and as such needs to be manifest within plausible reconstructions of brain connectivity. We demonstrate that scale-free network topology only emerges when adequately fine cortical parcellations are adopted alongside an appropriate correlation threshold, and provide the full design of the first open-source hardware platform to accelerate the calculation of large linear regression arrays.

AB Problem Statement: Design is an indispensable part of the human being. It enters one's life on the very first day that the eyes open. Design awareness is developed at an early age. With a proper education, even in the preschool years, design is experienced within one's close environment.
   Purpose of the Study: This study aims to determine the problems in the design education programs in the secondary schools of North Cyprus through evaluating Design and Technology lessons and proposing solutions in order to enhance the quality of design education. Accordingly, as a result of the first observations, problems occur and are defined, such as a lack of framework, systems, programs, and curriculum in teaching design. Additional problems are observed including a low level of physical and functional quality in the teaching and learning medium. Some teachers have a lack of knowledge and are not capable of teaching design, and some students have a lack of design background.
   Method: A one-year pilot study was conducted at four different secondary schools of North Cyprus. Accordingly, after the first series of observations were carried out using a random sampling method, the subject matter as the second action was conveyed to the Ministry of Education, which was determined as one of the actors in the action plan. Third, a commission was established by the Ministry of Education in order to initiate the action plan. Fourth, commission members who were selected among experienced experts developed a framework of teaching and learning. Fifth, the developed framework was tested at four pilot schools for a one-year study in addition to feedback given from the Design and Technology teachers in the seminars held. The internal and external feedback reflected the development and revisions to the tested framework.
   Findings and Results: Inter Creative Course Model was developed in line with the achieved results of the field study and offered three concepts: 1) learning by doing and doing by learning ("Hands on minds on,") 2) learning from friends and learning with friends ("Over the shoulder learning,") and 3) learning from experience ("Know how learning.") The model provided five benefits to the students: increase creative problem solving ability, develop self-confidence, improve social skills, reinforce aesthetic value and develop ability of management.
   Conclusions and Recommendations: The results of this study indicated that even an intangible concept such as design could easily be taught and learned like a tangible concept such as science or mathematics. A systematic structure including the alphabet of design, which contains its vocabulary and principles, will be presented in this study.

AB The recent development of open-source 3-D printers makes scaling of distributed additive-based manufacturing of high-value objects technically feasible and offers the potential for widespread proliferation of mechatronics education and participation. These self-replicating rapid prototypers (RepRaps) can manufacture approximately half of their own parts from sequential fused deposition of polymer feedstocks. RepRaps have been demonstrated for conventional prototyping and engineering, customizing scientific equipment, and appropriate technology-related manufacturing for sustainable development. However, in order for this technology to proliferate like 2-D electronic printers have, it must be economically viable for a typical household. This study reports on the life-cycle economic analysis (LCEA) of RepRap technology for an average US household. A new low-cost RepRap is described and the costs of materials and time to construct it are quantified. The economic costs of a selection of 20 open-source printable designs (representing less than 0.02% of those available), are typical of products that a household might purchase, are quantified for print time, energy, and filament consumption and compared to low and high Internet market prices for similar products without shipping costs. The results show that even making the extremely conservative assumption that the household would only use the printer to make the selected 20 products a year the avoided purchase cost savings would range from about $300 to $2000/year. Assuming the 25 h of necessary printing for the selected products is evenly distributed throughout the year these savings provide a simple payback time for the RepRap in 4 months to 2 years and provide an ROI between >200% and >40%. As both upgrades and the components that are most likely to wear out in the RepRap can be printed and thus the lifetime of the distributing manufacturing can be substantially increased the unavoidable conclusion from this study is that the RepRap is an economically attractive investment for the average US household already. It appears clear that as RepRaps improve in reliability, continue to decline in cost and both the number and assumed utility of open-source designs continues growing exponentially, open-source 3-D printers will become a mass-market mechatronic device.

AB Here, a simple micro free-flow electrophoresis (mu FFE) was developed for fluorescence sensing of monosaccharide via supermolecule interaction of synthesized boronic acid functionalized benzyl viologen (-BBV) and fluorescent dye. The mu FFE contained two open electrode cavities and an ion-exchange membrane was sandwiched between two polymethylmethacrylate plates. mu FFE: (i) up to 90.5% of voltage efficiency due to high conductivity of ion-exchange membrane; (ii) a strong ability against influence of bubble produced in two electrodes due to open design of electrode cavities; and (iii) reusable and washable separation chamber (45 mm x 17 mm x 100 m, 77 L) avoiding the discard of mu FFE due to blockage of solute precipitation in chamber. Remarkably, the mu FFE was first designed for the sensing of monosaccharide via the supermolecule interaction of synthesized -BBV, fluorescent dye, and monosaccharide. Under the optimized conditions, the minimum concentration of monosaccharide that could be detected was 1 x 10(-11) M. Finally, the developed device was used for the detection of 0.3 mM glucose spiked in human urine. All of the results demonstrated the feasibility of monosaccharide detection via the mu FFE.

AB The rapid detection and identification of infectious disease pathogens is a critical need for healthcare in both developed and developing countries. As we gain more insight into the genomic basis of pathogen infectivity and drug resistance, point-of-care nucleic acid testing will likely become an important tool for global health. In this paper, we present an inexpensive, handheld, battery-powered instrument designed to enable pathogen genotyping in the developing world. Our Microfluidic Biomolecular Amplification Reader (mBAR) represents the convergence of molecular biology, microfluidics, optics, and electronics technology. The mBAR is capable of carrying out isothermal nucleic acid amplification assays with real-time fluorescence readout at a fraction of the cost of conventional benchtop thermocyclers. Additionally, the mBAR features cell phone data connectivity and GPS sample geotagging which can enable epidemiological surveying and remote healthcare delivery. The mBAR controls assay temperature through an integrated resistive heater and monitors real-time fluorescence signals from 60 individual reaction chambers using LEDs and phototransistors. Assays are carried out on PDMS disposable microfluidic cartridges which require no external power for sample loading. We characterize the fluorescence detection limits, heater uniformity, and battery life of the instrument. As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrate the detection of the HIV-1 integrase gene with the mBAR using the Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) assay. Although we focus on the detection of purified DNA here, LAMP has previously been demonstrated with a range of clinical samples, and our eventual goal is to develop a microfluidic device which includes on-chip sample preparation from raw samples. The mBAR is based entirely around open source hardware and software, and in the accompanying online supplement we present a full set of schematics, bill of materials, PCB layouts, CAD drawings, and source code for the mBAR instrument with the goal of spurring further innovation toward low-cost genetic diagnostics.

AB We describe a microscopy design methodology and details of microscopes built to this open' design approach. These demonstrate the first implementation of time-domain fluorescence microscopy in a flexible automated platform with the ability to ease the transition of this and other advanced microscopy techniques from development to use in routine biology applications. This approach allows easy expansion and modification of the platform capabilities, as it moves away from the use of a commercial, monolithic, microscope body to small, commercial off-the-shelf and custom made modular components. Drawings and diagrams of our microscopes have been made available under an open license for noncommercial use at http://users.ox.ac.uk/atdgroup. Several automated high-content fluorescence microscope implementations have been constructed with this design framework and optimized for specific applications with multiwell plates and tissue microarrays. In particular, three platforms incorporate time-domain FLIM via time-correlated single photon counting in an automated fashion. We also present data from experiments performed on these platforms highlighting their automated wide-field and laser scanning capabilities designed for high-content microscopy. Devices using these designs also form radiation-beam end-stations' at Oxford and Surrey Universities, showing the versatility and extendibility of this approach.

AB The tensile modulus of articular cartilage is much larger than its compressive modulus. This tension compression nonlinearity enhances interstitial fluid pressurization and decreases the frictional coefficient. The current set of studies examines the tensile and compressive properties of cylindrical chondrocyte-seeded agarose constructs over different developmental stages through a novel method that combines osmotic loading, video microscopy, and uniaxial unconfined compression testing. This method was previously used to examine tension-compression nonlinearity in native cartilage. Engineered cartilage, cultured under free-swelling (FS) or dynamically loaded (DL) conditions, was tested in unconfined compression in hypertonic and hypotonic salt solutions. The apparent equilibrium modulus decreased with increasing salt concentration, indicating that increasing the bath solution osmolarity shielded the fixed charges within the tissue, shifting the measured moduli along the tension-compression curve and revealing the intrinsic properties of the tissue. With this method, we were able to measure the tensile (401 +/- 83 kPa for FS and 678 +/- 473 kPa for DL) and compressive (161 +/- 33 kPa for FS and 348 +/- 203 kPa for DL) moduli of the same engineered cartilage specimens. These moduli are comparable to values obtained from traditional methods, validating this technique for measuring the tensile and compressive properties of hydrogel-based constructs. This study shows that engineered cartilage exhibits tension-compression nonlinearity reminiscent of the native tissue, and that dynamic deformational loading can yield significantly higher tensile properties.

AB In this paper, a bistatic passive radar receiver system named Coherent-scatter Atmospheric Passive Radar Imager (CAPRI) is described. It is primarily designed to study the dynamics of the upper atmosphere by utilizing transmitters of opportunity as the RF target illuminators. CAPRI is constructed using the open source software-defined radio toolkit, GNU Radio, to meet the signal processing requirements in combination with the open source hardware, Universal Software Radio Peripheral 2, for data acquisition. The resultant system is highly flexible, and we present the details of the design as well as a performance analysis. CAPRI will be deployed in Peru, near the magnetic equator, for long-term operations in the area. FM stations near Lima, Peru, will be utilized with the targets of interest being the equatorial electrojet and the spread F. The results will then be compared to the Jicamarca Unattended Long-term investigations of the Ionosphere and Atmosphere (JULIA) radar data, and CAPRI will be used to improve the simultaneous time and spatial coverage in the region in a more cost-effective manner.

AB Objectives. Due to concerns about the safety of stimulants for ADHD, novel assessments of the cardiopulmonary impact of these agents are needed. Methods. An open design of lisdexamfetamine (LDX) in 15 adults with DSM-IV ADHD. Following a psychiatric evaluation and medical history, subjects underwent echocardiography (TTE) and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). LDX was titrated to 70 mg daily over 6 weeks, followed by monthly visits to 6 months. Change in TTE and CPET measures were examined following up to 6 months of LDX. Results. At endpoint, there were no significant alterations in indices of cardiac systolic performance, or in metabolic and ventilatory variables at maximum exertion (P values > 0.05). We found significant mean changes in resting LV systolic dimension and Doppler diastolic indices. Change in heart rate recovery at 1 min met statistical significance (P = 0.05). Conclusions. We did not detect clinically meaningful changes in cardiac structure and function or in metabolic and ventilatory variables at maximum exertion in ADHD adults receiving open LDX. The clinical significance of changes in resting LV dimension and indices of diastolic function are not in the direction of cardiomyopathy. Future large sample controlled study can examine these findings, as well as stimulants' impact on heart rate recovery.

AB For many years robotics has been benefited from the open source community. Software community projects like Player, Stage, Gazebo, ROS, or OpenCV are present in most robotic applications. In recent years this trend has also been initiated among electronic and mechanical developments (open hardware). The Arduino development platform is a good example of a successful hardware project with a great community of developers and users around it. The apparition of personal 3D printers is bringing the open source philosophy to the fabrication of physical things as well. This new technology is in need of new designing tools to take advantage of it. In this paper we are presenting the C++ Object Oriented Mechanics Library (OOML), a tool to design mechanical components, taking into account the needs and requirements of these emerging technologies. These designs can be easily shared, reused, and modified. The OOML brings together the advantages of (1) modelling things through code, (2) the object oriented programming paradigm, and (3) the power of C++. In the OOML, mechanical parts are described as geometrical combinations of basic primitives. Once a part is defined, fabrication files can be generated in order to print, or mechanize it. Models could also be used for simulation, visualization, structural analysis, etc.

AB OpenPMU is an open platform for the development of phasor measurement unit (PMU) technology. A need has been identified for an open-source alternative to commercial PMU devices tailored to the needs of the university researcher and for enabling the development of new synchrophasor instruments from this foundation. OpenPMU achieves this through open-source hardware design specifications and software source code, allowing duplicates of the OpenPMU to be fabricated under open-source licenses. This paper presents the OpenPMU device based on the Labview development environment. The device is performance tested according to the IEEE C37.118.1 standard. Compatibility with the IEEE C37.118.2 messaging format is achieved through middleware which is readily adaptable to other PMU projects or applications. Improvements have been made to the original design to increase its flexibility. A new modularized architecture for the OpenPMU is presented using an open messaging format which the authors propose is adopted as a platform for PMU research.

AB The virtual design of machining centers is a modern and well-known computer aided technique. Several modeling and simulation architectures, based on the lumped mass approach and on finite element method, are now well established and widely exploited worldwide. These solutions rapidly allow the basic setup of the kinematics of the feed drives and make possible a dynamic optimized dimensioning of all the main subsystems and structures of the machining center. This paper deals with research efforts aimed at developing an innovative and open design platform which allows the integration, in a user friendly framework, of the main procedures cited above with other design tools and facilities. An operator interface procedure and a package of input-output graphic routines, managed through a multilevel data base, are now active in this framework and interact with lumped mass and finite elements modules. According to these considerations the proposed tool allows to quickly and easily analyze alternative design solutions and makes possible to optimize the dynamic performances of the machine tool, helping the designer in the definition of the optimum machine tool characteristics before the manufacturing of the physical prototype. In order to demonstrate the potential of the proposed platform an example concerning the mass optimization of the Y axis of a gantry machining center is presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The high cost of what have historically been sophisticated research-related sensors and tools has limited their adoption to a relatively small group of well-funded researchers. This paper provides a methodology for applying an open-source approach to design and development of a colorimeter. A 3-D printable, open-source colorimeter utilizing only open-source hardware and software solutions and readily available discrete components is discussed and its performance compared to a commercial portable colorimeter. Performance is evaluated with commercial vials prepared for the closed reflux chemical oxygen demand (COD) method. This approach reduced the cost of reliable closed reflux COD by two orders of magnitude making it an economic alternative for the vast majority of potential users. The open-source colorimeter demonstrated good reproducibility and serves as a platform for further development and derivation of the design for other, similar purposes such as nephelometry. This approach promises unprecedented access to sophisticated instrumentation based on low-cost sensors by those most in need of it, under-developed and developing world laboratories.

AB Just as the power of the open-source design paradigm has driven down the cost of software to the point that it is accessible to most People, the rise of open-source hardware is Poised to drive down the cost of doing experimental science to expand access to everyone. To assist in this aim, this paper introduces a library of open-source 3-D-printable optics components. This library operates as a flexible, low-cost public-domain tool set for developing both research and teaching optics hardware. First, the use of parametric open-source designs using an open-source computer aided design package is described to customize the optics hardware for any application. Second, details are provided on the use of open-source 3 D printers (additive layer manufacturing) to fabricate the primary mechanical components, which are then combined to construct complex optics-related devices. Third, the use of the open-source electronics prototyping platform are illustrated as control for optical experimental apparatuses. This study demonstrates an open-source optical library, which significantly reduces the costs associated with much optical equipment, while also enabling relatively easily adapted customizable designs. The cost reductions in general are over 97%, with some components representing only 1% of the current commercial investment for optical products of similar function. The results of this study make its clear that this method of scientific hardware development enables a much broader audience to participate in optical experimentation both as research and teaching platforms than previous proprietary methods.

ID SIMULATION; SOUND
AB The FireFader is a simple haptic force-feedback device that is optimized for introducing musicians to haptics. It is based upon a single-degree-of-freedom potentiometer fader coupled to a DC motor, also known as a "motorized fader." A light is connected in parallel with the motor to help communicate the force's strength visually. The FireFader consists of only open-source hardware and open-source software elements. Consequently, it is relatively easy for users to repurpose it into new projects involving varying kinds and numbers of motors and sensors.
   An open-source device driver for the FireFader allows it to be linked to a computer via USB so that the computer can perform the feedback control calculations. For example, the computer can simulate the acoustics of a virtual musical instrument to concurrently synthesize sound and calculate the motor force as a function of the fader position. The serial connection over USB increases the latency of the control signal compared to embedded implementations, but the serial connection facilitates easier programming via the computer, and the force feedback can be automatically disabled when the user is not touching the fader. Some new devices derived from the FireFader design are presented.

AB The U.S. air traffic control system is reliant on legacy systems that artificially limit air traffic capacity. With the demand for air transportation increasing each year, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has introduced the Next Generation (NextGen) upgrade to modernize the air traffic control system. Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), a key component of the NextGen upgrade, enables an aircraft to generate and broadcast digital messages that contain the GPS coordinates of aircraft. The incorporation of ADS-B is intended to provide enhanced accuracy and efficiency of surveillance as well as aircraft safety. The open design of the system, however, introduces some security concerns. This paper evaluates the limitations of the legacy systems currently used in air traffic control and explores the feasibility of employing format-preserving encryption, specifically the FFX algorithm, in the ADS-B environment. The ability of the algorithm to confuse and diffuse predictable message input is examined using message entropy as a metric. Based on the analysis, recommendations are provided that highlight areas which should be examined for inclusion in the ADS-B upgrade plan. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Background: Dermoscopy has been widely implemented to diagnose various skin and scalp disorders. However, existing devices that call for direct scalp contact may alter the appearance of hair features or perifollicular structures.
   Objective: This paper will show how the Canfield DermScope(R) can quickly and easily identify various nonscarring and scarring scalp disorders. Its open design does not change the direction of affected hairs or blanch certain features such as erythema. Features like perifollicular hyperkeratosis and loss of follicular orifices are still easily visible.
   Methods and Materials: The author prospectively photographed patients with hair and scalp disorders in private practice between 2011 to 2012 using the handheld Canfield DermScope device.
   Results: The presence of scale, erythema, tufting, miniaturized or broken hairs, and loss of follicular orifices were quickly identified to make a diagnosis.

TI THE LIFE CYCLE OF A RADIOSONDE

LA English
DT Article
ID UPPER-AIR MEASUREMENTS
AB THE LIFE CYCLE OF A RADIOSONDE The development of scientific instruments Was, only a few years ago, confined to universities and electronics companies having highly specialized human and/or technical resources. With the advent of open hardware initiatives, engineers, scientists, hobbyists, and even people with limited electronic skills have been able to tinker with complex electronic systems. Taking advantage of these inexpensive and widely available tools and in the context of an engineering project class for undergraduates, the authors set about building a working radiosonde prototype from the ground up, based on an open hardware platform and easily accessible components.
   As a result, a fully functional radiosonde has been built that measures, records, and transmits pressure, temperature, humidity, and wind, plus a small camera that stores images on a flash card. A release system was also developed so that the radiosonde can be detached from a balloon upon reaching a certain height, pressure level, or flight time. Once it is released., one can attempt the recovery of the radiosonde with the help of a precalculated trajectory using a numerical mesoscale forecasting model and visualization software. The performance of the sonde Was compared with two commercial radiosondes using climate chambers and two field launches. This paper also discusses some of the more interesting capabilities foreseeable for such a platform: 1) collaboration between meteorology and engineering departments in both education and research, and 2) development of a flexible hardware platform that allows for an effective way to compare different commercially available sensors and to easily integrate new prototype sensors.

AB The open hardware mobile manipulator (OHMM) is a new open platform with a unique combination of features for teaching robotics software and algorithms. On-board low- and high-level processors support real-time embedded programming and motor control, as well as higher-level coding with contemporary libraries. Full hardware designs and software source codes are available under free licenses enabling the community to adapt and update the design as the field (and available hardware) evolves. Digital manufacturing (3-D printing and laser cutting) methods, now available as low-cost Internet services, enable OHMM to be easily modified and to be built from scratch for a competitive price. Five hands-on curriculum modules are presented that use OHMM to teach robotics software and algorithms at the undergraduate and graduate levels, and results are presented based on student performance and feedback.

AB In this paper a new control-interface card for developing simple control loops and generating test signals for power electronic converters is presented. The control board can operate with two computational cores (Texas Instruments and Microchip) allowing using the preferred DSP architecture and development environment. Moreover, the interface board can operate with open hardware Arduino-like boards such as the ChipKit Uno32. The paper also describes how to enhance the performance of a ChipKit Uno32 with a dsPIC obtaining a more suitable solution for power electronics. The basic blocks and interfaces of the boards are presented in detail as well as the board main specifications. The board operation has been tested with three core platforms: TI Piccolo controlSTICK, a Microchip dsPIC and a ChipKit Uno32 (Arduino-like platform). The board was used for generating test signals for characterizing 1200 V Si and SiC power semiconductors. A 6 kW dc-dc converter prototype is presented; the converter is based on the developed interface board.

AB Comprehensive bioinformatics repositories for the standard model organisms like mouse [9], rat [8], zebrafish [12], Drosophila [10] and Xenopus [4] provide access to all levels of sequence data sets, including genome, transcriptome and proteome data. For non-standard model organisms, very little information from publically accessible data have been collected and organized. This situation prevents dissemination of useful research information to a broader research community and keeps such model organisms in isolation.
   One of these organisms is the red spotted newt Notophthalmus viridescens, known for its exceptional regenerative capabilities for more than 200 years. The newt possesses the ability to entirely replace lost appendages [5, 13] and regenerate the lens [7], parts of the central nervous system [2], and the heart [1, 11].
   These unique features make the newt an excellent model to study fundamental processes of tissue regeneration. Challenging is the fact, that the estimated genome size of the newt is up to 10 times larger than that of humans. These circumstances have severely impeded genome projects despite the increasing speed and capacities of modern sequencing machines and assembly algorithms. As a result of these drawbacks, approximately only 100 non-redundant protein sequences for the newt are available in the NCBI-NR database, although a set of almost 11 000 sequenced Expressed Sequence Tags ( ESTs) from regenerating hearts of the newt Notophthalmus viridescens exists [3].
   In this context the 'Newtomics Resource' (http:/8/newtomics.mpi-bn.mpg.de/) [6] is developed as a bioinformatics tool with an integrated database, which enables researchers to analyze, retrieve and store data sets dedicated to the molecular characterization of this organism in a data-warehouse like manner. Newtomics has a unique transcript-centered database design, which refers to the biological reality and allows analyzing, storing, managing and data-mining of complex high-throughput datasets, as well as meta-information. The integrated design combines high-throughput data from NGS and traditional sequencing, annotation and functional characterization as well as quantitative expression data from time-series microarray-experiments and RNA-seq approaches. Furthermore, Newt-omics is also capable to work with large sets of identified peptides derived from a mass spectrometry approach.
   The design is open to additional datasets from different sources, without the need to change the database-structure or the data within. The integrated information is analyzed and data-mined by bioinformatics tools and pipelines, which processes the external data from operational sources. A web based graphical user interface allows access to the sets of molecular data. The implemented tools and the transcript-centered view combines and visualizes all kinds of data and allows a live view of the data on the transcriptomic and proteomic level.
   The open design and the bioinformatics tools allow a transfer of these achievements and use this important bio-computational tool in similar projects, which also focus on the characterization of niche model organisms.

AB Since its introduction in 1992, Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) has evolved to become a worldwide standard in mobile telephony. Security in GSM, albeit being one of the most important issues, has not yet been scrutinized to a level it deserves owing mainly to the expensive hardware requirements and lack of thorough understanding of GSM protocols in general. This scenario is changing significantly with the growing rate of development of open-source tools, which can serve to harness the RF signaling and enable processing on a general purpose workstation. In this paper, these open-source tools are utilized to study the feasibility of developing a GSM Protocol Analyzer and investigating the theoretical security protocols and procedures through practical implementation of such system. Universal Software Programmable Radio Peripheral (USRP) was selected as the RF frontend for the protocol analyzer. The USRP is a general purpose, open-hardware transceiver that can be linked to a workstation via an RJ45 Gigabit Ethernet link. Various open-source software, based primarily on GNU Radio, are then utilized to synchronize, demodulate and decode the received signal.

Internally, randomness is distilled from the entropy source using Algorithm M where modified-RC4-based and BLAKE-512-as-counter-mode pseudo-random number stream generators are combined. Users access the device via HTTP on a TCP/IP network and platform specific device drivers are not required. The random number files were tested using stringent statistical tests including DIEHARD, STS 2.1.1, dieharder 3.31.1, TestU01 1.2.3 SmallCrush and ENT. Emphasis was put on low cost of hardware.

AB In Low power and Lossy Networks (LNNs), routing has been considered as a main design and development challenge. This has led to the open design of the IPv6 routing protocol for LLNs called RPL. The protocol allows creating groups (instances) of multiple loop-free routing topologies over a physical network. The purpose of forming an optimized tree routing topology is to drive packets from the nodes to the collection point or sink which is the root of the tree. In this paper, we take advantage of extracted routing information to support high performance transmission of priority packets by proposing a QoS-aware cross-layer mechanism. The mechanism is explained and its performance is evaluated through simulation experiments. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism provides high Packet Reception Ratio with low Packet Delivery Latency for priority traffic.

Thirty-three patients (GJG group) received oral administration of 7.5 g/day GJG and 27 patients (B12 group) received oral administration of 1500 mu g/day B12. Neuropathy was evaluated according to DEB-NTC (Neurotoxicity Criteria of Debiopharm), Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTC) ver. 3.0, and a visual analogue scale (VAS). This study employed a randomized open design. Results: The incidence of neuropathy was 39.3% in the GJG group, and 88.9% in the B12 group (p<0.01). In the GJG group, grade 1 DEB-NTC was observed in 2 cases, grade 2 in 5 cases and grade 3 in 5 cases. Grade 1 NCI-CTC was observed in 7 cases, grade 2 in 6 cases, and VAS was 2.7 +/- 2.2. In the B12 group, grades 1, 2 and 3 DEB-NTC were observed in one case, 12 cases and 12 cases, respectively; and grades 1, 2 and 3 NCI-CTC were observed in 11 cases, 12 cases and one case, and VAS was 4.9 +/- 2.4. Conclusions: Concomitant administration of GJG is useful in preventing neuropathy in breast cancer patients treated with a DOC regimen.

AB Our paper presents a teaching project in the context of architectural education which inquires the fusion of learning processes within both physical and digital media. Our approach, situated within an undergraduate program, aims to blur the boundaries between physical and digital activities in order to enhance and amplify their qualities and, by doing so, broadening students' understanding and awareness of extending design-based media. The program relies upon an open, design-driven, game-inspired process. While the games allow to explore form and space by following a set of simple directions, the games' constraints guide the teaching of specific drawing and representation techniques. The exercises span two semesters of the first year curriculum. Within the exercises we re-approach the embodiment of skill based upon possibilities, paths and strategies to combine design-based media as a conglomerate to draw from rather than as a set of singular techniques.

DE design error localization; diagnostic test; debug
AB Statistical simulation based design error debug approaches strongly rely on quality of the diagnostic test. At the same time there exists no dedicated technique to perform its quality assessment and engineers are forced to rely on subjective figures such as verification test quality metrics or just the size of the diagnostic test. This paper has proposed two new approaches for assessing diagnostic capability of diagnostic tests for automated bug localization. The first approach relies on probabilistic simulation of diagnostic experiments. The second assessment method is based on calculating Hamming distances of the individual sub-tests in the diagnostic test set. The methods are computationally cheap and they provide for a measure of confidence in the localization results and allow estimating impact of the diagnostic test enhancement. The approach is implemented as a part of an open-source hardware design and debugging framework zamiaCAD. Experimental results with an industrial processor design and a set of documented bugs demonstrate feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB We report on the design and installation of a spectrometer system for monitoring solar radiation in Cochabamba, Bolivia. Both the light intensity and the spectral distribution affect the power produced by a photovoltaic device. Local variations in the solar spectrum (especially compared to the AM1.5 standard) may have important implications for device optimization and energy yield estimation.
   The spectrometer system, based on an Ocean Optics USB4000 (300-900nm) spectrometer, was designed to increase functionality. Typically systems only record the global horizontal radiation. Our system moves a fiber-optic cable 0-90 degrees and takes measurements in 9 degree increments. Additionally, a shadow band allows measurement of the diffuse component of the radiation at each position. The electronic controls utilize an Arduino UNO microcontroller to synchronizes the movement of two PAP bipolar (stepper) motors with the activation of the spectrometer via an external trigger. The spectrometer was factory calibrated for wavelength and calibrated for absolute irradiance using a Sellarnet SL 1-Cal light source.
   We present preliminary results from data taken March-June, 2013, and comment on implications for PV devices in Cochabamba.

DE Real-Time Ethernet; safety-critical systems; open-source hardware
   design; multi-segmented networks
AB Ethernet is widely recognized as an attractive networking technology for modern distributed real-time systems. However, standard Ethernet components require specific modifications and hardware support to provide strict latency guarantees necessary for safety-critical applications. Although this is a well-stated fact, the design of hardware components for real-time communication remains mostly unexplored. This becomes evident from the few solutions reporting prototypes and experimental validation, which hinders the consolidation of Ethernet in real-world distributed applications.
   This paper presents Atacama, the first open-source framework based on reconfigurable hardware for mixed-criticality communication in multi-segmented Ethernet networks. Atacama uses specialized modules for time-triggered communication of real-time data, which seamlessly integrate with a standard infrastructure using regular best-effort traffic. Atacama enables low and highly predictable communication latency on multi-segmented 1Gbps networks, easy optimization of devices for specific application scenarios, and rapid prototyping of new protocol characteristics. Researchers can use the open-source design to verify our results and build upon the framework, which aims to accelerate the development, validation, and adoption of Ethernet-based solutions in real-time applications.

System assessment was carried out by spectrophotometric determination of iron (II) in natural water. The sampling rate was estimated as 45 determinations per hour and the coefficient of variation was lower than 3%. Per determination, 208 mu g of 1-10-phenanthroline and ascorbic acid were consumed, generating 1.3 mL of waste. "Arduino" proved a reliable microcontroller with low cost and simple interfacing, allowing USB communication for solenoid device switching in flow systems.

DE SDR; MIXER; RTL-SDR; USRP; GNU Radio-Companion
AB The field of wireless communication has become the hottest area and Software Defined Radio (SDR) is revolutionizing it. By bringing much functionality as software, SDR reduces the cost of hardware maintenance and up-gradation. Open source hardware such as USRP (Universal Software Radio Peripheral) and software called GNU Radio-Companion are commonly used to do experiments in SDR. Since the cost of USRP is high, a low cost set up is needed which is affordable by the student community. In this paper a low cost alternative to USRP is proposed using RTL-SDR (Realtek Software Defined Radio) which is only used for reception. For transmitting purpose, a mixer circuit can be used to map the baseband signal to the band that can be received by RTL-SDR on the other end on Linux / Windows platform. Initially, the experiment is done in simulation. After that, it is tested with low cost hardware such as mixer and RTL-SDR. The cost for total transceiver system can be less than USD 100 which is 10 times less than the existing one.

DE Rapid prototypes; Open source hardware; Three Dimensional Printing;
   Manufacturing systems
AB 3DP (Three Dimensional Printing) technology is one of the SFF (Solid Freeform Fabrication) technologies which have recently come into the spotlight due to its adaptability to various applications. However, commercial 3DP machines are limited as to the use of building material, without voiding the warranty on the machine.
   At the same time, a rise in domestic rapid prototyping machines is observed, but none of these machines use the 3DP process. Therefore, an open source 3DP machine is designed and built. In this study, the machine is discussed and the first experiments are carried out to create ceramic (alumina and zirconia) membranes with specific physical properties.
   The purpose for developing this machine was opening up the opportunity to investigate printing ceramic membranes and reactors. Were, contrary to many other applications, maximal compaction of the powder during deposition is not desirable, to maintain an open structure the walls of the printed object. The machine is able to deposit the powder with adjustable bulk density, which is used to alter the properties of the membrane. The design of the printer (drawings, electronic layout, software) is publicly released under an open source license, free for others to adapt, build and use, e.g. in academic research.

AB In 2008, in the quest towards large solar facilities, a pan-European project was started to study a 4-m European Solar Telescope (EST). As one of the major partners, Utrecht played a significant role in the design, in particular in relation to the intended open design, its enclosure, telescope mechanics as well its polarimetric properties. Mid-2011 the work did result in an innovative conceptual design for EST.

   Standardization design
AB This paper proposes a dual-mode modeling technology based on software- Computer Aided X Alliance (CAXA), and verifies the method with a belt conveyor as an example. The purpose of dual-mode modeling technology integrating innovation design pattern and engineering design pattern is to achieve a fusion between open design and accuracy design technology. Dual-mode modeling approach breaks single thought constraint owned by traditional parametric modeling, which has a strict relationship like father and son between part elements. By means of design example, this paper described the help that unique three-dimensional sphere functions only owned by CAXA give the solid modeling. This paper took belt conveyor for an example, introduced dual-mode modeling process and verified this approach. Combined with the help of the idea of modular design, this paper has accomplished assembly design of the driving motor module, roller device module and transmission device module. The results show that the design speed under the condition of dual-mode modeling can improve more than one time compared with the traditional methods, design error is greatly reduced and design efficiency is also greatly advanced.

DE format preserving encryption; FFX; ADS-B; FAA NextGen security
AB The United States' national airspace system (NAS) is reliant on legacy systems and technology that stems from the 1970s. Indeed, the Air Traffic Control (ATC) radar surveillance system is antiquated, the controller communication protocol is unreliable, and the traffic management process is heavily dependent on human perception of conflict. As a result, the safety margin incorporated into the ATC separation standards artificially limits air traffic capacity. With the demand for air transportation increasing each year, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has introduced the Next Generation (NextGen) upgrade to modernize ATC capabilities. Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), a key component of the NextGen upgrade, enables an aircraft to generate and broadcast digital messages that contain the aircraft's Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates. Ground stations and other aircraft within range will be able to interpret the sender's location, trajectory, and identification. The incorporation of ADS-B surveillance is intended to provide enhanced surveillance accuracy, efficiency, and safety. The open design of the system, however, introduces inherent security concerns. Currently, ADS-B messages can be received and decoded by any receiver within range that is tuned to the operating frequency. Additionally, recent research has demonstrated aircraft position and tracks are surprisingly simple to fabricate-making it possible for malicious spoofing to flood the ATC system. In each instance, the ability to intercept and fabricate authentic ADS-B messages was accomplished using inexpensive, store-bought equipment. Such key vulnerabilities could be mitigated using encryption, providing message confidentiality and aircraft authentication. However, implementation of a large-scale, distributed encryption scheme is nontrivial. This paper evaluates limitations of the legacy systems currently associated with the ATC and explores the feasibility of employing Format Preserving Encryption (FPE), specifically the FFX algorithm, within ADS-B communication. Based on the analysis, recommendations are provided that highlight areas that should be examined for inclusion in the ADS-B upgrade plan.

AB The increasing pace of economic development and urbanization around the world has led to serious problems of environmental pollution, particularly from automobile emissions which contributes to Global Warming. In this paper, a low-cost mobile urban environmental monitoring system is proposed using off-the-shelf open source hardware and software. The system can be installed or used in public transport vehicles, particularly in school and college buses in countries like India. A pollution map of local and regional environments can be built from the data acquired, and displayed online leading to increased awareness of urban pollution problems. The system can also be used in situ in school and college buses to educate children and youth on emerging technologies like computer hardware, software, and web technologies. Results of prototype implementation are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.

AB Although aquaculture in the Mediterranean is a relatively young industry, finfish diseases have been reported to cause considerable problems and mortalities among the farmed stocks. In general, the farming activity and the open design of Mediterranean aquaculture systems allow the transmission of infectious pathogens within and among farm facilities. Fish health and biosecurity programmes at farms have focused on the most obvious pathways for transmission of pathogens, i.e. through transport of infected farmed fish from hatcheries, infected equipment, staff and vessels, as well as through water currents. However, little attention has been devoted to the potential risk of pathogen and disease transmission in Mediterranean open-sea aquaculture through movements of fish. The present study focuses on the importance of considering possible pathogen transmission between reared fish, farmed escapees and farm-aggregated fish when making management decisions.

AB BACKGROUND: Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is characterized by severe debilitating chronic pain. Patients with CRPS may experience various pain sensations, which likely embody different pathophysiologic mechanisms. In this study, we evaluated the differential effects of central gamma-aminobutyric acid (B) receptor stimulation on the different pain qualities in CRPS patients with dystonia.
   METHODS: The 10 pain qualities of the neuropathic pain scale, dystonia severity, and changes in use of antinociceptive drugs were evaluated every 3 months for a period of 1 year in 42 CRPS patients with dystonia receiving titrated doses of intrathecal baclofen (ITB) treatment in an open design.
   RESULTS: Using a linear mixed model analysis and controlling for global dystonia severity and the use of supplemental analgesics, we found a significant improvement in global intense pain, sharp pain, dull pain, and deep pain during the first 6 months. After this period, the scores leveled off despite further improvement of dystonia and continued ITB dose escalation.
   CONCLUSIONS: gamma-Aminobutyric acid (B) receptor stimulation by ITB exerts differential antinociceptive effects on specific pain qualities in CRPS patients with dystonia. (Anesth Analg 2013;116:211-5)

AB Optimization under uncertainty (OUU) is a powerful methodology used in design and optimization to produce robust, reliable designs. Such an optimization methodology, employed when the input quantities of interest are uncertain, yields output uncertainties that help the designer choose appropriate values for input parameters to produce safe designs. Apart from providing basic statistical information, such as mean and standard deviation in the output quantities, uncertainty-based optimization produces auxiliary information, such as local and global sensitivities. The designer may thus decide the input parameter(s) to which the output quantity of interest is most sensitive, and thereby design better experiments based on just the most sensitive input parameter(s). Another critical output of such a methodology is the solution to the inverse problem, i.e., finding the allowable uncertainty (range) in the input parameter(s), given an acceptable uncertainty (range) in the output quantities of interest. We apply optimization under uncertainty to the problem of heat transfer in fin heat sinks with uncertainties in geometry and operating conditions. The analysis methodology is implemented using DAKOTA, an open-source design and analysis kit. A response surface is first generated which captures the dependence of the quantity of interest on inputs. This response surface is then used to perform both deterministic and probabilistic optimization of the heat sink, and the results of the two approaches are compared. [DOI: 10.1115/1.4007669]

AB The need exists for robust and efficient optimal design methods for application to multibody systems, in which the components to be designed represent connections between large displacement, large rotation motions of the subsystems' bodies. One specific application is occupant restraint systems, such as the Gunner Restraint System (GRS), in which both the vehicle and the gunner can undergo large relative and absolute motions under extreme driving or external threat conditions. In addition, the restraint/connection components can have amplitude-dependent, time-dependent, and timing-dependent behaviour, such as an active belt retractor. Current optimisation methodologies are ill suited for this problem, suffering from infeasibility, lack of robustness, and/or high computational expense. This paper presents an extension of topology optimisation techniques to consider multibody dynamics systems and to treat a much more open design space, which can include passive, active, and reactive structures/devices. The objective is to obtain an optimally combined structural and material system, considering the best use of passive, active and reactive members.

AB In this paper we present an FPGA-based architecture to export flows in 10 Gbps networks, implemented on the NetFPGA-10G platform. Flow-based monitoring is a powerful methodology to analyze and detect network issues, such as congested links or DDoS attacks. Our design provides the following advantages: (i) The architecture allows processing 10 Gbps links without sampling, even for the highest packet rate of 14.88 Mpps (Million packets per second) that corresponds to the shortest (64-byte) Ethernet frames; (ii) It is possible to manage up to 786,432 concurrent flows; (iii) The project is developed in an open-source hardware platform and the HDL code is open to the community; (iv) The proposed approach frees network routers from the burden of exporting flows.

AB Robust velocity and position estimation at high update rates is crucial for mobile robot navigation. In recent years optical flow sensors based on computer mouse hardware chips have been shown to perform well on micro air vehicles. Since they require more light than present in typical indoor and outdoor low-light conditions, their practical use is limited. We present an open source and open hardware design (1) of an optical flow sensor based on a machine vision CMOS image sensor for indoor and outdoor applications with very high light sensitivity. Optical flow is estimated on an ARM Cortex M4 microcontroller in real-time at 250 Hz update rate. Angular rate compensation with a gyroscope and distance scaling using a ultrasonic sensor are performed onboard. The system is designed for further extension and adaption and shown in-flight on a micro air vehicle.

AB This paper presents a robust velocity estimation algorithm applicable to low-cost monocular platform with a tri-axial gyroscope. The algorithm is developed based on PX4FLOW platform which is an open software and open hardware solution for monocular speed estimation. The paper provides three main contributions. The first is the improved robustness achieved by various methods including feature block selection, feed-forward rotation, motion compensation, failure case detection and filtering. The second contribution is the improved performance in terms of resolution and search range achieved by adaptive frame interval and advanced search algorithm. The final contribution is a systematical strategy for parameter selection to fully utilize the hardware resources and optimize the performance in different contexts. The performance was benchmarked against the PX4FLOW and GPS. Results indicated that the proposed algorithm achieved levels of robustness exceeding that of PX4FLOW in measuring velocity. Also, the integrated trajectory agreed with the position calculated by an on-board GPS system.

AB Access to a prototype during R&D can play a crucial role in early identification of the weaknesses in the design. Under circumstances that a particular commercial subsystem with the exact required specific features is unavailable, the realization of such a prototype can be delayed. In this paper, an example of rapid prototyping for a dual-channel biosignal data acquisition system based on the open-source concept is described. The selected biosignal is the finger photoplethysmogram. Except for Matlab, all other software components are open-source. The hardware design of the optical sensor utilized to record the signals is also open-source, making the system extremely affordable with the advantage of flexibility and customization. Precise timing of the samples allows for proper alignment and delay estimation between the acquired traces, useful in arterial stiffness studies. Although the results presented concern only two channels, the system has the ability to be expanded to six channels. Further possible expansions include the addition of custom filtering, on-board data compression and advanced GUI.

AB Utility companies around the world are replacing electro-mechanical power meters with new smart meters. These digital power meters have enhanced communication capabilities, but they are not actually smart. We present the cognitive power meter (c-meter), a meter that is actually smart. By using load disaggregation intelligence, c-meter is the realization of demand response and other smart grid energy conservation initiatives. Our c-meter is made of two key components: a prototype open source ammeter and an optimized embedded load disaggregation algorithm (mu Disagg). Additionally, we provide an open source multi-circuit ammeter array that can build probabilistic appliance (or load) consumption models that are used by the c-meter. mu Disagg is the first load disaggregation algorithm to be implemented on an inexpensive low-power embedded processor that runs in real-time using a typical/basic smart meter measurement (current, in A). mu Disagg can disaggregate loads with complex power states with a high degree of accuracy.

AB In order to overcome the shortages that motion-level robot language is difficult to be transplanted, robot's functions are difficult to be extended because of the closed language environment and lacking of a standard motion-level robot language among robot manufacturers, a compiling and interpreting system of industrial robot which is based on the Lua script language in an open hardware control system is proposed. In this system, a set of more relatively general-used motion-level robot language has been designed. The structure of the software has been designed in using of object-oriented programming and the functions of the software have also been modularized to facilitate function extending. Implementation strategy of the interpreting part has been also designed in using of chain of responsibility pattern. Thus, the compiling and interpreting system becomes fully open-ended. The software which is constructed by the system has been demonstrated on Visual Studio 2008 platform, the experimental results indicate that the robot can move accurately under the control of the software and the functions of the software can be extended conveniently, thereby proves the compiling and interpreting system to be a suitable and effective method.

AB The open design and position of disc brake that is closed to road surfaces enable contaminants to enter the brake gap and caused noise and tribological disturbance at the brake interface. Contaminants such as dirt and soil can be present and are expected to influence the occurrence of brake squeal that produce an annoying sound during braking action. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of external hard particles at different disc sliding speed on generation of brake squeal using a brake dynamometer. Different rotational speed of disc brake was selected and the experiments squeal noise data was collected and analyzed using the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) analyzer. From the experiments, the presence of external particle and the rotation speed of disc brake promotes the generation of brake squeal phenomenon by changing the surface roughness and effective contact of brake interface. Results obtained from the experiment also showed that higher rotating disc generate higher sound level meter or squeal frequency and increase numbers of squeal noise generated.

The conceptualization comprises all stages in the design process, ranging from need-finding to the openness of the design documents and the data gathered during the design process, and the commercialization of the end-product. The aspects of the product and the process merge in this framework, intertwining the aspects of technical, legal and commercial openness. Finally, the article proposes a research agenda for open design. The article builds on an extensive literature review about studies on 'open' in design: open-source software, open hardware, and participatory methods in design, such as co-design and participatory design, and user-engagement methods such as crowdsourcing and co-creation.

AB Technical progress in the open-source self replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) community has enabled a distributed form of additive manufacturing to expand rapidly using polymer-based materials. However, the lack of an open-source metal alternative and the high capital costs and slow throughput of proprietary commercialized metal 3-D printers has severely restricted their deployment. The applications of commercialized metal 3-D printers are limited to only rapid prototyping and expensive finished products. This severely restricts the access of the technology for small and medium enterprises, the developing world and for use in laboratories. This paper reports on the development of a <$2000 open-source metal 3-D printer. The metal 3-D printer is controlled with an open-source micro-controller and is a combination of a low-cost commercial gas-metal arc welder and a derivative of the Rostock, a deltabot RepRap. The bill of materials, electrical and mechanical design schematics, and basic construction and operating procedures are provided. A preliminary technical analysis of the properties of the 3-D printer and the resultant steel products are performed. The results of printing customized functional metal parts are discussed and conclusions are drawn about the potential for the technology and the future work necessary for the mass distribution of this technology.

DE Digital workflow; prototyping; acoustic simulation; collaborative design
AB Digital workflows from the design to the production of buildings have received significant recent attention in architectural research. The need for both integrated systems for design collaboration (Boeykens and Neuckermans, 2006) and clear and flexible communication flows for nonstandard fabrication outcomes have been identified as fundamental (Scheurer, 2010). This paper reports on the development of a digital "design system" for the design and prototyping of an acoustic enclosure for meetings in a large open work environment, the FabPod. The aim was to keep this system open for temporal flexibility in as many aspects of the finalisation of the design as possible. The system provides novel examples of both integrated collaboration and clear communication flow. (1) Acoustics is included as a design driver in early stages through the connection of digital simulation tools with design models. (2) Bi-directional information flows and clear modularisation of workflow underpins the system from design through to fabrication and assembly of the enclosure. Following the completion and evaluation of the FabPod prototype, the openness of the system will be tested through its application in subsequent design and prototyping iterations. Design development will respond to performance testing through user engagement methods and acoustic measurement.

AB The goal of the project was to investigate the flight behavior of a futuristic blended wing body concept in high altitudes. The shape to be tested was based on cooperation with its Swiss inventor Koni Schafroth from Team Smartfish [I]. The overall motivation for the project is the search for new reentry technologies. VEXREDUS stands for Vehicle with EXtended REentry Duration University of Stuttgart", referring to reentry vehicles with a high Lift to Drag ratio.
   The project work involved the following tasks:
   CNC/CAM based mold construction
   Building of airframe in CFRP/GFRP sandwich technology
   Development of own autopilot software on existing open source hardware
   Implementation of own telemetry protocol
   Development of a ground station
   Development of a Redundant power supply
   Development of a parachute system
   Thermal and vacuum testing
   As a BEXUS team we were part of two launch campaigns at the ESRANGE facility in Northern Sweden. Though we had our share of setbacks, we were able to demonstrate the airframe's excellent flying characteristics and suitability for high altitude missions. The paper shall take a look at the technical challenges we've been facing and the investigations we made to learn more about the things that didn't work as expected, as well as the results drawn from the whole experiment.

AB Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are widely used in mechanical engineering. Although achieving a high level of confidence in numerical modelling is of crucial importance in the field of turbomachinery, verification and validation of CFD simulations are very tricky especially for complex flows encountered in radial turbines. Comprehensive studies of radial machines are available in the literature. Unfortunately, none of them include enough detailed geometric data to be properly reproduced and so cannot be considered for academic research and validation purposes. As a consequence, design improvements of such configurations are difficult. Moreover it seems that well-developed analyses of radial turbines are used in commercial software but are not available in the open literature especially at high pressure ratios.
   It is the purpose of this paper to provide a fully open set of data to reproduce the exact geometry of the high pressure ratio single stage radial-inflow turbine used in the Sundstrand Power Systems T-100 Multipurpose Small Power Unit. First, preliminary one-dimensional meanline design and analysis are performed using the commercial software RITAL from ConceptsNREC in order to establish a complete reference test case available for turbomachinery code validation. The proposed design of the existing turbine is then carefully and successfully checked against the geometrical and experimental data partially published in the literature. Then, three-dimensional ReynoldsAveraged Navier-Stokes simulations are conducted by means of the Axcent-PushButton CFD CFD software. The effect of the tip clearance gap is investigated in detail for a wide range of operating conditions. The results confirm that the 3D geometry is correcty reproduced. It also reveals that the turbine is shocked while designed to give a high-subsonic flow and highlight he importance of the diffuser.

AB A colorimeter is a common tool used for the profiling of visualization devices. Different kinds of colorimeters can be found on the market, with different characteristics and performances. They are based on different working principles, from tristimulus colorimeters to actual spectrophotometers, and their prices range from few hundreds to thousands of Euros. In this work we describe and analyze a recently introduced colorimeter, that may be of particular interest for the research community, since it is an open hardware project and that, consequently, grants the public availability of data about its hardware and its firmware together with device drivers as free software.

AB TV White Spaces (TVWS) technology and regulation has the potential to make connectivity both technically and economically feasible in rural Africa where affordable access remains a challenge. The superior propagation characteristics of TVWS technology make it particularly well suited to connecting remote communities. Evidence collected from our measurements in Malawi and Zambia suggest that most UHF spectrum is already available both in urban as well as in rural areas and could be used to provide Internet connectivity. In this paper we present the findings of a TVWS spectrum measurement initiative in Malawi and Zambia. We introduce an open hardware device that geo-tags spectrum measurements and saves the results on a micro SD card. The device can also be used to record the use of spectrum over long periods of time.

AB There have been several recent developments in Open Source Hardware that enable the creation of relatively low-cost sensors for remote deployment. The initial work done by ICFOSS for soil and atmosphere monitoring sensor networks, where the sensors had wired connections within each node, had limited their deployment to very short distances around the node. A hybrid approach using a mesh network consisting of 'motes'-based sensors is proposed in conjunction with the Raspberry Pi-based management layer to un-tether the sensors, leading to simplified field-based deployments. This approach enables multiple applications such as remote monitoring for disaster management, precision agriculture, wildlife monitoring or pollution monitoring in urban areas.

ID WATER
AB Ceramic pot filters (CPFs) are a promising lowcost option for household water treatment, providing a barrier of protection against microbiological contaminants for households with or without reliable piped water supplies. However, as an open-source design, performance of CPFs is not standard across manufacturers and at times can be suboptimal. Furthermore, no scientific study has provided a holistic framework for optimizing filter performance. The goal of this paper is to provide CPF manufacturers with tools to increase their ability to reach performance objectives for flow rate, bacteria removal and strength. This goal is achieved by experimentally determining relationships between performance and three manufacturing parameters: percentage rice husk, rice husk size and wall thickness. These results are translated into design and manufacturing recommendations, which are as follows: 1) tightly control rice husk size to maintain consistent flow rates; 2) maximize wall thickness within the constraints in order to improve bacteria removal; 3) seek alternative methods of increasing bacteria removal if removal levels greater than 2LRV are needed. To go further and provide a more quantitative and universal optimization framework, we then use the identified functional relationships between the manufacturing parameters and filter performance to formulate a single-criterion optimization. This framework enables manufacturers to determine an ideal combination of manufacturing parameters based on the specific situation of each manufacturing site. The systematic approach to CPF design presented in this paper can be further extended to address additional manufacturing parameters and aspects of filter performance to further improve the CPF design. This work has huge potential to better serve the many people around the world who lack safe drinking water.

AB Outdoor air pollution now contributes annually to over 3.2 million premature deaths worldwide and is among the top health risk factors. Urban air pollution is on course to become the top environmental cause of mortality by 2050 - greater than the effects of dirty water and lack of sanitation. This risk is especially high in developing countries, where it is often difficult or expensive to obtain air quality data.
   This paper outlines the initial development of a system for mapping crowd-sourced air quality data in urban environments in developing countries. This system includes a (1) low cost wearable air quality monitor and (2) a mapping and data visualization web application for use in urban settings in developing countries. Based on open source hardware and software, the air quality monitor is composed of an Arduino microcontroller and sensor shields and collects real-time geographically explicit air quality data, with data storage on removable memory. The mapping and data visualization web application uses javascript functions and Google Maps API to visualize the paths travelled and the intensity of ozone and particulate matter as a heat map.

ID DESIGN
AB One of the major obstacles in the study of HRI (human-robot interaction) with social robots is the lack of multiple identical robots that allow testing with large user groups. Often, the price of these robots prohibits using more than a handful. A lot of the commercial robots do not possess all the necessary features to perform specific HRI experiments and due to the closed nature of the platform, large modifications are nearly impossible. While open source social robots do exist, they often use high-end components and expensive manufacturing techniques, making them unsuitable for easy reproduction. To address this problem, a new social robotics platform, named Ono, was developed. The design is based on the DIY mindset of the maker movement, using off-the-shelf components and more accessible rapid prototyping and manufacturing techniques. The modular structure of the robot makes it easy to adapt to the needs of the experiment and by embracing the open source mentality, the robot can be easily reproduced or further developed by a community of users. The low cost, open nature and DIY friendliness of the robot make it an ideal candidate for HRI studies that require a large user group.

AB OpenDesignContinuum is a research project carried out in the context of our diploma thesis at the School of Architecture, N.T.U.A. It is a digital platform for the emergence of a collective design process. In particular, research focuses on the formation of a network of spaces, sited at the Municipality of Athens that will contribute to the activation of public space and its transformation to a receptor of social collective expressions. Therefore, there is an attempt to orchestrate a design model that encourages citizens to participate in it. In other words, a process of design, construction and management of a network of sites capable of hosting and promoting social events is promoted by the ODC platform. In this direction, necessary and sufficient condition is the involvement of citizens in all phases of the design process.

AB Background: We have previously shown that a standardized acupuncture augmentation was effective for antidepressant partial responders with major depressive disorder (MDD). This pilot study examines the efficacy and safety of this protocol as monotherapy for MDD.
   Methods: Thirty outpatients (73% female, mean age 47 +/- 12 yrs) with SCID-diagnosed MDD were recruited and received 8 weeks of standardized 30-minute open acupuncture treatment using 5 specific body points on the arms and legs bilaterally, with manual stimulation every 10 min, and concurrent electroacupuncture (2 Hz current) at two points along the midline of the head. Subjects were assigned to once-weekly (n=21) or twice-weekly (n=9) treatment, depending on preference. Change in Hamilton-D-17 score was the primary outcome measure, and positive response to treatment (defined as >= 50% improvement in HAM-D-17 scores compared to baseline) was the secondary outcome measure.
   Results: HAM-D-17 scores decreased from 19.1 +/- 4.4 to 9.9 +/- 6.3 (p<0.001) in the once-weekly acupuncture group, and from 21.9 +/- 5.3 to 14.3 +/- 6.1 (p=0.012) in the twice-weekly acupuncture group. Improvement did not differ significantly between treatment arms. Response rates were 62% for the once-weekly acupuncture group and 22% for the twice-weekly acupuncture group (NS). Twenty patients (14 in weekly treatment group and 6 in twice-weekly treatment group) completed the study. The most common side effects included mild soreness/pain (n=13), and mild bleeding (n=16) at the needle site.
   Limitations: Open design and small sample.
   Conclusions: Standardized acupuncture treatment was safe, well-tolerated and effective, suggesting good feasibility in outpatient settings. Replication in controlled trials is warranted. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB In a short period of time, open design went from an unknown notion to a buzzword in the Dutch design world. This development is usually attributed to the proliferation of bottom-up activities fostered by a typically open Dutch society. However, although open design is commonly associated with grassroots, bottom-up activities, in the Netherlands, the most visible effort at widespread dissemination of these ideals has been the result of a highly centralized effort largely supported by government funding. Why were the government and cultural organizations interested in fostering open design practices? And what type of open practices has this top-down model engendered? Advancing from a constructivist approach, we examine how this discourse has been formed by the convergence of actors with distinct agendas, and position it in relation to its cultural and economic contexts.

DT Article
DE open design; relational design; rhizome; performance;
   non-representational theory
AB Open design is a new design paradigm that creates a lot of dilemmas for designers to deal with. However, these dilemmas are mostly being discussed from within the design sector itself and from very polarized perspectives which do not provide much depth to create ways to deal with this new paradigm. This paper considers open design as a philosophical position that relates to broader cultural developments and puts the way we deal with design in the perspective from our attitude to identity which can be described as a performance. To create a new thinking space to reconsider openness, the non-representational thought model of the rhizome is applied to examples from Dutch design culture which will offer a more thorough understanding of where the true innovative power of open design lies.

SO DESIGN JOURNAL

DT Article
DE open design; hackers; immaterial labour; contested design
AB Open design has emerged as a topic generated by a new logic of thinking: the internet with its rhizomatic creative networks and open software. Over the last decades the network has become a new conceptual technology by which to think and describe the world in a new way, and collaborative networks have also become the main actors in the new economy, generating questions of what 'open' actually means. As a new generation of knowledge and design workers set out to engage with networked and post-Fordist labour they also generate new forms of conflict. The power over standards and protocols guides the use of the creative platforms, both enabling collaborative and co-creative design as well as shaping it according to the aims of those setting the standard. Similarly, on an organizational and political scale it seems open design may 'bite back' in an increasingly conflicting form of 'immaterial labour', fragmenting any organized resistance and making every creative act freely exploitable under the irresistible slogan of 'open'. Today, we may be seeing a new class of precarious and 'free' creative work being produced by a 'cognitarian' or 'hacker' class, revealing the creative industries as the low-wage sweatshops they are. Open design may make us feel free, yet that does not mean we are not controlled. It may be obvious, but open does not only mean free or shared, but also exposed, unsettled and contested.

TI Pimp Your Home: Or Why Design Cannot Remain Exclusive From a Consumer
   Perspective
SO DESIGN JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE consumer research; DIY; identity; function
ID CONSUMPTION
AB This paper looks into the way the consumer moves along the paradigm shift of design from being objects of status identity, towards open design, with a focus on the making rather than the having. In 2005 the magazine Wallpaper* advertised a lamp designed by Massimo Vignelli (1955), with the slogan: I don't care what it is for, I want it. This message represents very much the generic meaning in the 2000s, of design being about status and artistic form, rather than about function and practical use. Based on a 2009 study of the way inhabitants in one street in full gentrification in Flanders, think of, buy into and actively participate within the design field, this paper shows how the Flemish public has very much been influenced by the narratives of lifestyle media and design producers. However, in the way they deal with design at home, it becomes obvious that the majority of respondents do not much buy into mediated design objects, nor do they want to be associated with the non-functional status symbol these products often represent. However, almost all participants have actively been refurbishing their home within the aesthetics of a much promoted design-style, which leads to the conclusion that not only the designer himself, but also the consumer, is recently looking for another meaning of design. Making seems to be more important than having, which coincides with the growing interest in open design.

TI Vdiff: a program differencing algorithm for Verilog hardware description

SO AUTOMATED SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

DT Article
DE Software evolution; Program differencing; Hardware description languages
AB During code review tasks, comparing two versions of a hardware design description using existing program differencing tools such as diff is inherently limited because these tools implicitly assume sequential execution semantics, while hardware description languages are designed to model concurrent computation. We designed a position-independent differencing algorithm to robustly handle language constructs whose relative orderings do not matter. This paper presents Vdiff, an instantiation of this position-independent differencing algorithm for Verilog HDL. To help programmers reason about the differences at a high-level, Vdiff outputs syntactic differences in terms of Verilog-specific change types. The quantitative evaluation of Vdiff on two open source hardware design projects shows that Vdiff is very accurate, with overall 96.8 % precision and 97.3 % recall when using manually classified differences as a basis of comparison. Vdiff is also fast and scalable-it processes the entire revision history of nine open projects all under 5.35 minutes. We conducted a user study with eight hardware design experts to understand how the program differences identified by the experts match Vdiff's output. The study results show that Vdiff's output is better aligned with the experts' classification of Verilog changes than an existing textual program differencing tool.

AB OBJECTIVE: To quantify owner concerns regarding clinical signs in canine patients receiving chemotherapy and to assess degree of concordance between client and veterinarian concerns regarding patient quality of life.
   METHODS: Retrospective analysis of owner-reported concerns during chemotherapy treatment. Owner-reported adverse events were recorded sequentially for each patient through a partially open design questionnaire and correlated with veterinary patient summaries for each visit. Canine patients treated for transitional cell carcinoma, haemangiosarcoma, malignant melanoma or osteosarcoma were eligible for inclusion. Minimum treatment eligibility was two chemotherapy treatments given in 21-day protocol cycles, with a maximum of six treatment cycles recorded.
   RESULTS: A total of 553 evaluable visits, seen by 18 oncology clinicians, were assessed. Owners expressed concern before chemotherapy in 48% of visits. Owner concerns at the first visit did not differ significantly from those expressed at the sixth visit. Remission status was a significant factor in owners' rate of reporting concerns. Diarrhoea grade was associated with owners' concerns. Clinician gender was not associated with responsiveness to owners' concerns.
   CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Questionnaire-based surveys appear to be an effective tool for communicating dog owners' concerns regarding chemotherapy and potentially for monitoring a clinician's attentiveness. Owners expressed concerns at approximately half of chemotherapy appointments.

AB The rise of solar photovoltaic (PV) technology as a driver of rural electrification in the developing world and a contributor to climate change mitigation suggests that innovations enhancing PV efficiency and scalability could make considerable strides in reducing both poverty and greenhouse gas emissions. The nearly global access to the solar resource coupled to innovation-driven decreases in the costs of PV provides a path for a renewable energy source to accelerate sustainable development. Open-source software development has proven to produce reliable and innovative computer code at lower costs than proprietary software through sharing development responsibility with a large community of invested individuals. Concepts of open-source design have been applied to other fields in an attempt to reap the same benefits realized within software development: however, applying open-source strategies to solar PV research is uncommon. This paper reviews and examines how open-source design can be utilized to catalyze rapid innovation in the PV industry. The results show how successful open design and development methods can be created and utilized by identifying business models that provide PV researchers, turnkey suppliers and solar PV module manufacturers with the opportunity to utilize open-source design principles to accelerate innovation.

AB Sufficient bone decompression of osteophytes is important for positive functional outcomes in anterior cervical spine surgery. Achieving good alignment and bone fusion in anterior cervical decompression and fusion requires a bone graft bed of the optimum size and shape. We have developed a stainless steel instrument named the anterior fusion spinal fork, which is designed to aid in accurately drilling the bone cavity, thus enabling selection of the correct size of bone graft or bone graft substitutes. The device has an open design with 4 prongs, and resembles a three-dimensional fork. This instrument assists in guiding the direction of drilling, and marking the drilling point of the graft cavity with pyoctanin markers. We have used this instrument in 40 cases of anterior cervical spine surgery using the modified Smith-Robinson procedure since March 2000. This simple instrument allowed us to design and construct a bone graft cavity of the correct size and shape for iliac bone graft or bone graft substitutes for anterior cervical spine surgery.

DE democratic media production; design; knowledge exchange; monopolies of
   knowledge; open source cultures; political economy
AB The commercial success of open source software, along with a broader socio-cultural shift towards participation in media and cultural production, have inspired attempts to extend and expand open source practices. These include expansions from software into general culture through 'Free Culture' movements and, more recently, expansions from software into hardware and design. This article provides a critical perspective on the democratic potential of these broader 'open' contribution structures by examining how open source contributions to both software and hardware increase the opportunities for democratic participation in production, governance and knowledge exchange. By analysing attempts to 'open source' the sharing of hardware designs, it also notes the limitations of this democratization. The insights developed in the article nuance the relationship between open source cultures and commercial and market structures, identifying how the generative opportunities created by certain aspects of open source contribution structures increase the potential for democratizing production of communication tools, but also how incongruities across different open-source cultures and communities of practice limit the democratic potential of these processes.

AB Social and psychological stressors are both a part of daily life and are increasingly recognized as contributors to individual susceptibility to develop diseases and metabolic disorders. The present study investigated how snacks differing in sensory properties and presentation can influence ratings of affect in consumers with different levels of dispositional anxiety. This study examines the relationships between a pre-disposition to anxiety and food using a repeated exposures design with three interspersed test days over a period of two weeks. The study was conducted on ninety free-living male (n = 28) and female (n = 62) Dutch participants aged between 18 and 35 years old, with a BMI between 18 and 25 kg/m(2) and different anxiety trait levels assessed using State-Trait Anxiety Inventory tests. The study was randomized by age, gender, anxiety trait score, and followed a parallel open design. Three test products: dark chocolate, a milk chocolate snack and crackers with cheese spread (control), which differed in composition, sensory properties and presentation, were evaluated. Changes in self-reported anxiety, emotion, and energetic states were assessed as a function of eating the snacks just after consumption and up to one hour. The repeated exposure design over a period of two weeks enabled the investigations of potential cumulative effects of regular consumption of the food products. The milk chocolate snack resulted in the decrease of anxiety in high anxiety trait subjects, whereas dark chocolate and cheese and crackers respectively improved the anxiety level and the energetic state of low anxiety trait participants. The mood effects were not altered with repeated exposure, and the magnitude of changes was similar on each test day, which illustrates the repeatability of the effects of the food on subjective measures of postprandial wellness.

TI SocialMesh: Can Networks of Meshed Smartphones Ensure Public Access to
   Twitter During an Attack?
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE
LA English
DT Article
AB We explore whether public data networks called SocialMesh - formed automatically from smartphone radio-routers and adapting to changing RF propagation and interference without relying on managed cellular infrastructure - can also be designed to overcome any and all countermeasures mounted by an attacker and reliably support social applications such as Twitter, Face-book, and Google. We rigorously examine the architecture, techniques and algorithms that make decentralized or "ad-hoc," ultrawideband networks work in the presence of hostile jamming or protocol attacks. We illustrate the RF link-budget using 3-d graphs to show how interference affects the network performance as these networks become heavily utilized or jammed. Using low-cost hardware, self-organizing routing software, and uncoordinated/distributed CDMA we show how they can retain adequate system capacity even under heavy load from users or interference from jammers. Open standardization and field trials of SocialMesh networks will further clarify SocialMesh security and performance by opening up the design specifications to international review. Open-source design specifications for SocialMesh will be updated at http://www.socialmesh.org.

SO NATURE CHEMISTRY

DT Article
ID SCAFFOLDS
AB Three-dimensional (3D) printing has the potential to transform science and technology by creating bespoke, low-cost appliances that previously required dedicated facilities to make. An attractive, but unexplored, application is to use a 3D printer to initiate chemical reactions by printing the reagents directly into a 3D reactionware matrix, and so put reactionware design, construction and operation under digital control. Here, using a low-cost 3D printer and open-source design software we produced reactionware for organic and inorganic synthesis, which included printed-in catalysts and other architectures with printed-in components for electrochemical and spectroscopic analysis. This enabled reactions to be monitored in situ so that different reactionware architectures could be screened for their efficacy for a given process, with a digital feedback mechanism for device optimization. Furthermore, solely by modifying reactionware architecture, reaction outcomes can be altered. Taken together, this approach constitutes a relatively cheap, automated and reconfigurable chemical discovery platform that makes techniques from chemical engineering accessible to typical synthetic laboratories.

AB Background and purpose: Deep brain stimulation of the internal globus pallidus (GPi-DBS) is established as an effective treatment of primary generalised dystonia in controlled studies. In cervical dystonia (CD), only one previous study has reported observer-blinded outcome assessment of long-term GPi-DBS, with 1-year follow-up.
   Methods: In this prospective, single-centre study, eight patients with CD (7 women: 1 man, 4 focal: 4 segmental) treated with bilateral GPi-DBS for median (range) 30 (1248) months, were evaluated by the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS; Severity, Disability and Pain scores), the Short-Form Health Survey-36 (SF-36), and the Becks Depression Index in an open design. In addition, a blinded rater assessed the TWSTRS Severity score from videos obtained preoperatively and at the last follow-up.
   Results: In the blinded evaluation, median (range) TWSTRS Severity score improved from 25 (19-30) to 8 (4-23) (P = 0.028), thus a 70% (23-82) score reduction. In the open evaluation, median Severity score improvement at the last follow-up was 73%, representing a significant further improvement from 50% at 6 months. The Disability and Pain scores improved by median 91% and 92%, respectively, and the SF-36 subdomain scores improved significantly. A reversible right hemiparesis and aphasia occured in one patient 4 days postoperatively, because of reversible oedema around the left electrode. No other serious adverse effects and no permanent morbidity were observed.
   Conclusions: This single-blinded study shows good long-term efficacy of GPi-DBS in CD patients and supports using this treatment in those who have insufficient response to medical treatment.

AB We describe an open-source freeware programme for high throughput analysis of nanoSIMS (nanometre-scale secondary ion mass spectrometry) data. The programme implements basic data processing and analytical functions, including display and drift-corrected accumulation of scanned planes, interactive and semi-automated definition of regions of interest (ROIs), and export of the ROIs' elemental and isotopic composition in graphical and text-based formats. Additionally, the programme offers new functions that were custom-designed to address the needs of environmental microbiologists. Specifically, it allows manual and automated classification of ROIs based on the information that is derived either from the nanoSIMS dataset itself (e.g. from labelling achieved by halogen in situ hybridization) or is provided externally (e.g. as a fluorescence in situ hybridization image). Moreover, by implementing post-processing routines coupled to built-in statistical tools, the programme allows rapid synthesis and comparative analysis of results from many different datasets. After validation of the programme, we illustrate how these new processing and analytical functions increase flexibility, efficiency and depth of the nanoSIMS data analysis. Through its custom-made and open-source design, the programme provides an efficient, reliable and easily expandable tool that can help a growing community of environmental microbiologists and researchers from other disciplines process and analyse their nanoSIMS data.

TI A readout for large arrays of microwave kinetic inductance detectors
SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
LA English
DT Article
ID MULTIPLEXER
AB Microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs) are superconducting detectors capable of counting single photons and measuring their energy in the UV, optical, and near-IR. MKIDs feature intrinsic frequency domain multiplexing (FDM) at microwave frequencies, allowing the construction and readout of large arrays. Due to the microwave FDM, MKIDs do not require the complex cryogenic multiplexing electronics used for similar detectors, such as transition edge sensors, but instead transfer this complexity to room temperature electronics where they present a formidable signal processing challenge. In this paper, we describe the first successful effort to build a readout for a photon counting optical/near-IR astronomical instrument, the ARray Camera for Optical to Near-infrared Spectrophotometry. This readout is based on open source hardware developed by the Collaboration for Astronomy Signal Processing and Electronics Research. Designed principally for radio telescope backends, it is flexible enough to be used for a variety of signal processing applications. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

AB CERN makes extensive use of the WorldFIP fieldbus interface in the LHC and other accelerators in the pre-injectors chain. Following the decision of the provider of the components to stop the developments in this field and foreseeing the potential problems in the subsequent support, CERN decided to purchase the design information of these components and in-source the future developments using this technology. The first in-house design concerns a replacement for the MicroFIP chip whose last version was manufactured in an IC feature size found to be more vulnerable to radiation of high energy particles than the previous versions. nanoFIP is a CERN design based on a Flash FPGA implementing a subset of the functionality allowed by the communication standard, fitting the requirements of the different users and including the robustness against radiation as a design constraint. The development presented involved several groups at CERN working together in the framework of the Open Hardware Repository collaboration, and aiming at maximizing the interoperability and reliability of the final product.

AB Here, we present the proof-of-concept for a subsurface bioelectrochemical system (BES)-based biosensor capable of monitoring microbial respiration that occurs through exocellular electron transfer. This system includes our open-source design of a three-channel microcontroller-unit (MCU)-based potentiostat that is capable of chronoamperometry, which laboratory tests showed to be accurate within 0.95 +/- 0.58% (95% Confidence Limit) of a commercial potentiostat. The potentiostat design is freely available online: http://angenentbee.cornel.edu/potentiostat.html. This robust and field-ready potentiostat, which can withstand temperatures of -30 degrees C, can be manufactured at relatively low cost ($600), thus, allowing for en-masse deployment at field sites. The MCU-based potentiostat was integrated with electrodes and a solar panel-based power system, and deployed as a biosensor to monitor microbial respiration in drained thaw lake basins outside Barrow, AK. At three different depths, the working electrode of a microbial three-electrode system (M3C) was maintained at potentials corresponding to the microbial reduction of iron(III) compounds and humic acids. Thereby, the working electrode mimics these compounds and is used by certain microbes as an electron acceptor. The sensors revealed daily cycles in microbial respiration. In the medium- and deep-depth electrodes the onset of these cycles followed a considerable increase in overall activity that corresponded to those soils reaching temperatures conducive to microbial activity as the summer thaw progressed. The BES biosensor is a valuable tool for studying microbial activity in situ in remote environments, and the cost-efficient design of the potentiostat allows for wide-scale use in remote areas.

   resistance; Energy capacity
ID FOUNDATIONS; SILLS
AB An experimental study on combined steel-to-timber joints with nails and bolts is conducted in this study. Principal results are as follows: The initial stiffness and effective allowable resistance of combined joints depend obviously on clearances in predrilled bolt-holes. The combined joints with nails and bolts have high potential of energy capacity to resist strong earthquake forces. There are upper limits of clearances in predrilled bolt-holes that allow advantages of considering the synthetic resistance of combined joints in practical structural design. Combining the joint components with appropriate design will give higher performance against strong earthquakes increasing the safety margin and energy capacity until the failure. The combined joints should be designed under the restrictions of particular specifications in closed design systems because the advantages of combining the joint components are influenced obviously by various actual conditions, which are too difficult to consider in detail in open design systems.

AB One of the most demanding challenges in the field of audio engineering is the transmission of low-latency high quality audio streams over networks. While several protocols nowadays allow wired local network streaming, much effort is still required to achieve similar goals over existing wireless LAN technologies. While the challenge is still far from being solved, several design issues can be highlighted and future scenarios can be outlined. This paper proposes the setup of a wireless music production system based on open hardware and open software which requires relatively low setup effort while allowing for a high flexibility of use. The hardware platform is the Beagleboard, based on Texas Instruments DM3730, running a GNU/Linux OS and the computer music language Pure Data. Such a device can capture electric instrument audio, generate sound, send MIDI or OSC control data, and stream to PCs and other embedded devices operating as mixers, effect racks and so on, enabling an ecosystem of flexible and open devices. Tests conducted on a home wireless network show acceptable latency for many applications.

AB The detection of anomalies in backbone networks is posing serious performance issues, not only in terms of accuracy, but also in terms of detection speed. Indeed current software solutions to the problem, even promising from the point of view of detection and false alarm rates, suffer from the inability of performing the required operations in real time, when working in high speed backbone networks. On the other hand, hardware solutions are based on costly and inflexible niche systems.
   To address such issues, in this paper, we propose a system based on a the implementation of a "classical" CUSUM-based anomaly detection method on an open networking platform accelerator (i.e., NetFPGA). The objective is to combine the high performance of a hardware oriented solution with the flexibility of general purpose PCs.
   The experimental results, shown in the paper, clearly demonstrate that the proposed system is able to overcome the current software implementations and to operate in high-speed backbone networks.

AB This study offers a new method for understanding the likelihood of acceptable fit for users of adjustable products and environments and is a useful tool for aiding the designer in making decisions about problems involving human variability. Accommodation, which describes the ability of a user to interact with a device or environment in a preferred way, is a key product performance metric. Methods that offer a better understanding of accommodation of broad user populations would allow for the design of products that are more cost-effective, safer; and/or lead to greater levels of customer satisfaction. This work uses parametric studies to explore the characteristics of a target user population and the probability of accommodating individuals of a given body size. Performance regions are identified in both the problem's design space (the product dimensions under consideration) and the anthropometry space of the target population (the relevant body dimensions of product users). The existence of probability contours is a result of outcome uncertainty due to anthropometry-independent user preference, and the analysis is achieved by assessing binary accommodation of individuals using a "virtual fit" method with many iterations. Two case studies, one univariate and one bivariate in both performance and anthropometry spaces, are presented. An important outcome of the decision making framework described in this work is the ability to intuitively gauge who in the population of target users will be disaccommodated by a design and how to improve overall accommodation.

AB In addition to robustness-related considerations, designers of long-lifetime products (e.g., buses, trains, freight trucks, and commercial aircraft) must also account for possible secular and demographic trends and their impacts on the ranges of anthropometry, capability, and preference of user populations. However; the uncertainty associated with forecasts of these trends complicates the decision-making process of the designer One of the decisions to be made is whether to efficiently allocate adjustability to accommodate the required percentage of only the current user population or to allocate additional amounts of adjustability to allow for more uniformly high accommodation levels throughout the product's lifetime. Postponing this decision until later in the life of the product could be a valuable option.
   This paper proposes a Black Scholes model-based real options methodology for the valuation of such decision-postponement in the design process. A simplified truck cab designed in 1977 and with a lifetime of 30 years is used as a demonstrative case study. The three population change scenarios considered are: no change, changes due to a secular trend (gradually increasing obesity), and changes due to a demographic trend (gradually changing gender split). Estimates of the body dimensions (anthropometry) of user populations in these three scenarios are utilized to study the impact of certain adjustability-allocation decisions on the accommodation levels of these populations. The secular trends scenario indicates the need to embed greater-than-optimal truck cab space which, in the future, may be used for a seat designed for the more obese user population. This decision is treated as a real option and is evaluated for different levels of uncertainty associated with secular trend forecasts and for different required rates of return. Despite the limitations of the approach due to certain simplifying assumptions, it is shown to be a good basis for future research into designing for changing user populations of long-lifetime products.

AB Designing products for multiple global user populations has been the focus of numerous studies. Based on an understanding of the current state of knowledge, this paper outlines three broad top-down design strategies to satisfy varying user, business, and regulatory requirements across target markets, and to do so in a resource-efficient manner The first strategy results in a set of optimal, robust, or reconfigurable designs for the markets. The second strategy is the development of a static platform-based design, with variants of the product for the different target markets. In the third strategy, flexibility is embedded into a platform itself; the manufacturer can then release the product in a few target markets, and can leverage the platform at later stages when entering additional markets or adapting to changing requirements. The implementation of the proposed strategies is explored in the context of three different products: (1) the Adidas Jabulani soccer ball, (2) left- and right- hand drive vehicles, and (3) the Apple suite of mobile and tablet devices. The observations in these case studies highlight the importance of the three global product design strategies, and help define certain questions for future research.

DE IPv6 Stack; 6LoWPAN; IoT; cross-layer design
AB IPv6 is often deployed in wireless sensor networks, and the advantages of such a deployment are well reported. For researchers which wish to experiment with new protocols or cross-layer design, there is often a choice of which IPv6 stack to base their work on. The FlexibleIP (FIP) stack presented here is an open-source design which makes documentation, code readability, and ease of modification a priority. In addition FIP provides compile-time options to support a wide variety of devices; it can fit into an 8-bit microcontroller, but can still use features typical when targeting larger microcontroller such as dynamic memory allocation for buffering many packets. The stack also offers excellent support for cross-layer design and hardware acceleration, two areas of special interest for low-power design. Conformance testing of the stack assures it adheres to relevant standards, and static analysis of the code is also performed. In addition to presenting this work, the paper highlights some design criteria that any IPv6 stack targeting low-power wireless networks should consider.

AB Implementation attacks, including side-channel, fault, and probing attacks, have received significant attention in both research and commercial communities. Successful attacks have been demonstrated against standard cryptographic algorithms implemented on a wide variety of common platforms. In order to protect against these attacks, designers must incorporate complex countermeasures into the implementation of sensitive operations. Validating the effectiveness of implementation attack countermeasures requires specialized expertise and techniques not commonly used in other types of security and functional testing. We propose a modular testing environment for use in verifying the implementation attack resistance of secure systems. The proposed environment is an open-source solution that allows implementation attack testing to be independent of the system platform, implementation details, and type of attack under evaluation. These key features make the environment suitable for use with an implementation attack security standard in which standard test procedures are published openly and used to evaluate cryptographic systems. We use the proposed test environment to demonstrate a successful side-channel attack on AES, which illustrates the practical usefulness of our design for analyzing implementation attack security. Our open-source design is available at http://rijndael.ece.vt.edu/iameter.

AB The high-precision and high-resolution surveying is not an easy question. The newest tools for those tasks are the unmanned systems, especially the aerial systems.
   The author built and developed a small and low-cost aerial surveying system, which fundamentally was based on a commercial model airplane and open-source hardware/firmware. The adaptation of these latter components allowed the semi-automatic or automatic stabilization and navigation of the airplane along a trajectory during surveying flights.
   The current used camera system is a small compact digital camera, which provides digital photographs with true-colour palette. During the flights, the camera was triggered automatically regarding to the requirements of the survey.
   With this configuration, very-high resolution photo mosaics were taken during several survey projects.
   This paper introduces the structure of the represented aerial system, especially the open-source autopilot system and some results.

AB SincX is an open sourced Controller designed for extensive and intuitive interaction with the computer. At present the most commonly used interface devices are the Keyboard and the Mouse but these devices require both the hands to use and most importantly they are not intuitive. SincX is a single handedly usable, touch sensitive controller. Its great design not only allows interaction to be great but it also makes playing games with it to be an awesome experience. The design of the controller makes it comfortable for disabled persons to use it single handedly and allows a lot of functions just using the touch of the fingers.

AB In this paper, we present a new design methodology for educational robotic platforms. Using printbots (open-source 3D-printable robots) as a starting point in our designs has allowed us to create custom robots with very little effort. Using this new methodology we have designed the ArduSkybot, a robot that has enough features for its usage at different educational levels while keeping a very reduced cost. The robot is based on Arduino and the Printshield, our new electronics platform. It provides integration of various sensors (light, distance and line sensors) and actuators (motors, lights and speaker). It is also easy to expand by students and researchers. We describe our designs, and document their performance in various workshops with college, primary and secondary students. Our methodology is described and suggestions are given regarding future printbot-based workshops.

DE Animation; digital arts; interactive; open hardware; open source
AB The aim of this work is to present an active and creative visualization method for mathematical concepts using 3D animation, modeling, simulation and story. The result is a first-hand experience of practical problems that need solutions. The method attempts to motivate investigation and problem solving by inviting the student to experience the problem itself through a creative activity.
   Although classic visualization models in mathematics involve three dimensional renderings and interactive animations and have proven to be effective in many situations, often they break down concepts into new concepts and then present segments to the observer. Most interactive models are predefined, driven by limited parameters that are available as a user interface. Many times we can see students wanting to use their creativity to interact instead of becoming the passive observer or operator.
   The active visualization method employs a measurable virtual 3D world with a time-line, a modeling tool-set and a physics simulation engine inside a common 3D animation package. The animation process strictly relies on segments controlled by non-linear function curves locked to time and therefore it provides an excellent ground to manipulate transformations without limitations even when those lead to problems. Students will engage in a creative activity that involves a story with a given goal by modeling and animating a phenomenon or group of phenomena that will lead to a problem they do not expect. The students will learn about a mathematical concept that provides the solution to their problem. They will integrate the concept and fix the problem to complete the story.
   Although there is a large number of topics and many levels of complexity where the method can be used at, for example modeling geometries to calculate volume or grouping large amounts of particles based on certain attributes, one of the most important elements is the storytelling that connects all participants.
   This work presents an example of using quaternion to adjust the rotation of a spaceship to change trajectory in order to fly back to the Earth. The spaceship will be driven to a gimbal lock in Euler angles.

AB Fiber-fed multi-object spectrographs have greatly enhanced the spectroscopic capabilities of the world's premiere telescopes, but their flexibility has typically been limited by a fixed effective slit size that constrains the available resolving power. We present a novel mechanism that, for the first time, equips a fiber-fed spectrograph with multiple discreet slits of different widths. In this paper, we detail the mechanical design of our variable slit mechanism, which is capable of positioning any one of six slits in front of the fibers immediately prior to injection into the spectrograph's optical train. Further, we present the details of related system necessary to achieve closed loop positioning of the slit mechanism given that no encoder is used. We also briefly discuss our use of open source and open hardware projects in the design. Finally, we describe the control system we have implemented for this subsystem.

AB Our group has designed, sourced and constructed a radiosonde/ground-station pair using inexpensive open-source hardware. Based on the Arduino platform, the easy to build radiosonde allows the atmospheric science community to test and deploy instrumentation packages that can be fully customized to their individual sensing requirements. This sensing/transmitter package has been successfully deployed on a tethered-balloon, a weather balloon, a UAV airplane, and is currently being integrated into a UAV quadcopter and a student-built rocket. In this paper, the system, field measurements and potential applications will be described. As will the science drivers of having full control and open access to a measurement system in an age when commercial solutions have become popular but are restrictive in terms of proprietary sensor specifications, "black-box" calibration operations or data handling routines, etc. The ability to modify and experiment with both the hardware and software tools is an essential part of the scientific process. Without an understanding of the intrinsic biases or limitations in your instruments and system, it becomes difficult to improve them or advance the knowledge in any given field.

AB Optimization under uncertainty is a powerful methodology used in design and optimization to produce robust, reliable designs. Such an optimization methodology, employed when the input quantities of interest are uncertain, yields output uncertainties that help the designer choose appropriate values for input parameters to produce safe designs. Apart from providing basic statistical information such as mean and standard deviation in the output quantities, uncertainty-based optimization produces auxiliary information such as local and global sensitivities. The designer may thus decide the input parameter(s) to which the output quantity of interest is most sensitive, and thereby design better experiments based on just the most sensitive input parameter(s). Another critical output of such a methodology is the solution to the inverse problem, i.e, finding the allowable uncertainty (range) in the input parameter(s), given an acceptable uncertainty (range) in the output quantities of interest.
   We apply optimization under uncertainty to the problem of heat transfer in fin heat sinks with uncertainties in geometry and operating conditions. The analysis methodology is implemented using DAKOTA, an open source design and analysis kit. A response surface is first generated which captures the dependence of the quantity of interest on inputs. This response surface is then used to perform both deterministic and probabilistic optimization of the heat sink, and the results of the two approaches are compared.

AB Open source hardware is a type of hardware where the schematics and designs are made unrestricted and available to all. They are often accompanied by open source software. This can bring reliability, ease of debugging, and modular development for rapid prototyping using pre-written libraries. Merits of using open source hardware are discussed and then applied to a portable sensor system based on the open hardware Arduino-derived Jeenode microcontroller board. The system uses an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and seamless integration of other sensors, including a piezo-resistive pressure sensor. It is shown that open source hardware can help to increase rapid development, reduce costs, and encourage further development.

AB An open source automation system for controlling electrical appliances using power line communication is presented here. Control messages are sent over Wi-Fi network from a Wi-Fi device to the micro-controller which then couples the messages to the power lines. Ubiquitous power lines are used as physical media to transmit data over 220V/50Hz signal to control appliances/equipment. The data from the microcontroller is coupled onto the power lines using a PLC (Power Line Communication) modem and DCSK (Differential Code Shift Keying) modulation technique is employed to transmit data. Each receiver unit consists of PLC modem plus microcontroller and can be connected anywhere in the power line network. The receivers have addresses assigned to them and only respond to the commands sent to them by the transmitter PLC modem. The receiver unit controls the flow of electricity to the socket. The entire system is devoid of a computer to save power and make it low cost. Use of open source hardware, Power Line Communication and micro-controller collectively reduce the cost of controlling appliances remotely.

DE Indoor localization; capacitive sensors; fall detection
AB Indoor localization is an important part of integrated AAL solutions providing continuous services to elderly persons. They are able to fulfill multiple purposes, ranging from energy saving or location based reminders to burglary detection. Particularly useful are combined systems that include localization, as well as additional services e.g. fall detection. Capacitive sensing systems that allow detecting the presence of a body over distance are a possible solution for indoor localization that has been used in the past. However usually the installation requirements are high and consequently they are expensive to integrate. We propose a flexible, integrated solution based on affordable, open-source hardware that allows indoor localization and fall detection specifically designed for challenges in the context of AAL. The system is composed of sensing mats that can be placed under various types of floor covering that wirelessly transmit data to a central platform providing localization and fall detection services to connected AAL platforms. The system was evaluated noncompetitive in the 2011 EvAAL indoor localization competition.

AB Innovative Testing Concept for the Determination of the Thermo-Mechanical Fatigue of Cylinder Heads. During the design process of cylinder heads, evaluation of thermo-mechanical fatigue plays an essential role. The IABG thermal cylinder head test rig presents an innovative method for assessing and optimizing cylinder heads with respect to their service strength against thermo mechanical fatigue at a very early stage in the development process. The test rig makes it possible to reduce the testing time and costs significantly in comparison with standard test methods, thus shortening the development time for new cylinder head designs. The test rig's novel, open design also makes it possible to detect crack initiation and investigate the propagation of cracks in the pent roof during thermo shock cycles for the very first time. Inspection procedures do not require the disassembly of the entire engine for fueled operation. The present article exemplifies this new test concept concerning thermo-mechanical fatigue on cylinder heads including the results of an experimental comparison of two constructive identical cylinder heads with different aluminum cast alloys.

AB Urban spaces are pervaded by interpretive and reactive technologies that shape and are shaped by its inhabitants, with an increasingly active role for citizen technologists. Yet the role of domestic spaces in shaping lived experience within the urban environment, and subsequent technological interventions, is often overlooked. Homes are framed as closed-off environments which isolate their inhabitants from the city, despite being porous spaces that are also filled with ubiquitous computing. In this paper we draw on the participatory design and user innovation literatures to present the methodology for the "Homesense" research project that explored how users design and develop "smart" technologies within their own homes, based on the intersection of their concurrent urban/domestic lived experience. Kits of open-source hardware were used as cultural probes, and co-located "lead users" provided technical expertise. This methodology demonstrates the importance of physical space and location in user-led domestic activities, and of combinations of technical and "lived" expertise in developing these interventions.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS

DT Article
AB Idleness has to be carefully exploited in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to save power and to accumulate the energy possibly harvested from the environment. State-of-the-art microcontroller units provide a wide range of ultra-low-power inactive modes with sub-millisecond wakeup time that can be effectively used for this purpose. At the same time they are equipped with 16-bit RISC architectures clocked at tens of MHz, which make them powerful enough to run a Java-compatible virtual machine (VM). This makes it possible to bring the benefits of a virtual runtime environment into power-constrained embedded systems. VMs, however, risk to impair the effectiveness of dynamic power management as they are seen as always-active processes by the scheduler of the operating system in spite of the idleness of the threads running on top of them. Avoiding to keep sensor nodes busy when they could be idle is mandatory for the energetic sustainability of WSNs. While most of the tasks of a sensor node are inherently event-driven, the functioning of its hardware-software components is not, so that they require to be redesigned in order to exploit idleness. This paper presents VirtualSense, an open-hardware open-source ultra-low-power reactive wireless sensor module featuring a Java-compatible VM.

AB This paper presents a free boundary propagation method (FBPM) to solve the topology optimization problem with an open design domain (ODD). The FBPM releases the imposed close "domain constraint," which often is activated in the classical standard topology optimization scheme and generates ideal results. This method solves the ODD topology optimization by transferring the original problem into a sequence of approximation sub-problems that can be solved by classical approaches. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the proposed algorithm. Examples show that the proposed method is easy to implement and efficient

ID INTEGRATION
AB STEP-NC standard contains information on how CNC machine tools can be represented from STEP product data model. STEP-NC is an extension of STEP which is the standard for exchange product model data. This determines the neutral data format for digital information from a product. This paper is to propose an architecture of intelligent controller via multi-agent-based conceptual as the reference architecture. It can be successfully used to create an open CNC on ISO standard of ISO 14649 and ISO 10303. This offers interoperability, portability, and adaptability. The proposed framework consists of four main modules, STEP-NC interface, simulator, data warehouse, and communication. In order to optimize, the controller should incorporate with various technology related to intelligent, such as kernel software, open communication port and open hardware design. The architecture will be implemented in CNC controller and to be tested later on actual milling machine. It will simplify the design of CNC machine controller with the architecture layers responsible for data processing, data storage, execution and feedback. This paper will discuss order towards the requirements for global interoperable manufacturing for real-life machining system.

AB The accelerator control systems at CERN will be upgraded and many electronics modules such as analog and digital I/O, level converters and repeaters, serial links and timing modules are being redesigned. The new developments are based on the FPGA Mezzanine Card, PCI Express and VME64x standards while the Wishbone specification is used as a system on a chip bus. To attract partners, the projects are developed in an 'Open' fashion. Within this Open Hardware project new ways of working with industry are being evaluated and it has been proven that industry can be involved at all stages, from design to production and support.

AB In this paper we assess the appropriateness of open organizing as a model for re-designing design education. First, we review prior work on open organizing, particularly open innovation, to understand what makes these approaches novel and successful. Next, we draw on empirical findings from field studies of open source software projects that leverage open innovation principles and outline the advantages that accrue from interacting with external communities and participants, thereby increasing the authenticity of projects, and of making the design task the cornerstone of the learning activity as opposed to structuring learning around a person. Finally, we synthesize lessons for creating open design experiences and offer suggestions that are equally applicable to in-class undergraduate design projects and to informal design projects undertaken by students.

AB This elaboration presents a new device based on dynamically programmable Analog Signal Processors (dpASP) developed for hard real-time control applications. The developed Programmable Analog Computer/Controller (PAC) is an open hardware for a wide range of signal processing tasks. In this report the analog signal routing and filter based signal processing realized by the dpASP is presented. This research was focused on the signals form as they are processed and transferred between analog processors. The investigation is exampled by the low-pass filter(s) embedded into every analog processor. For complex signal processing tasks a few dpASP must be routed together. The dpASP chain is created for signal diagnosis and due to the limited resources of a single device. Final conclusions related to chaining analog processors are given.

ID CREATIVITY
AB Lewis argues that there are a variety of generative cognitive processes that are more likely to occur in technology education than elsewhere in the curriculum(1). Design based Technology Education supports the development of higher cognitive thinking and problem solving skills, where students have the capacity to express their creativity and innovation through the completion of the artefact they design, manufacture, and report on(2). For effective higher order cognitive learning to occur students are encouraged to record and evidence their design evolution and development as the design journey progresses.
   Many of the current assessment models adopted in Design based Technology Education inadvertently encourage students to adopt a structured, linear approach in reporting on design activities. This structured approach can often lead to reverse engineering of the design portfolio subsequent to the students' convergence on their initial design idea. The reverse engineering of portfolios places greater emphasis on the end-product and removes the focus from the design journey undertaken.
   This study investigates a cohort of initial teacher education students (n=27) as they participate in a design-based module to solve a semi-open design brief. Throughout the design journey students were encouraged to simultaneously collect data which they felt was relevant in the communication of their capability and learning throughout the design task. This data was then presented through the use of a non-criterion referenced e-portfolio system. The usage of common media types emerged and are presented in relation to the four stages of Kolb's learning cycle.
   The findings identify six predominant media types utilised by the students in the collection and representation of data which informed their final design outcome. These findings are presented under the four stages of Kolb's learning cycle and identify the occurrences of each stage throughout the portfolios. The manner in which students utilised different media at different stages of their learning is analysed and outlines the dominance of various media types to communicate various stages of student learning. This is of significant importance to Design based Technology Education as it outlines the importance of constructivist e-portfolios in addressing the linear design approach and allows for a clearer interpretation of students' learning. The evidence presented clearly demonstrates how students represented the various stages of learning through the media available which has significance for course designers planning to use electronic portfolios.

AB This paper presents a new freely available, open source design flow to accelerate the usage of application-specific processors in System-on-Chip designs. The proposed flow combines our Transport-Triggered Architecture (TTA) processor toolset and Kactus2 IP-XACT design environment. The IP-XACT standard and our Kactus2 tool make it easy to integrate and configure intellectual property (IP) components from multiple vendors whereas the configurable TTA provides a fast and efficient path from C-to-VHDL. We present 3 use cases for TTA: as a ready-made fixed accelerator, a general-purpose processor, and a tailored application-specific processor. Moreover, management of instance-specific data in IP-XACT is discussed. The combined design flow is presented in detail step-by-step, and the user time spent on each step is evaluated. Provided that C source codes and IP-XACT library are available, a non-HW oriented engineer can implement an FPGA based multiprocessor product in less than 5 hours.

AB In this paper we propose an open source design tool that allows designers to easily conceive, evaluate and design the full auditory experience of a building, based on a digital three-dimensional model. A guiding principle has been the dynamic nature of the configuration of sound sources and listeners. Hence, a system is created that enables sound sources as well as listeners to be defined as moving entities. Furthermore, the ability exists for listeners, in their own movements and interactions, to generate sounds as well. In the system, proposed in this paper, ray-tracing is used to simulate the spatial acoustics. The paper discusses the considerations regarding several implementation choices and regarding adoption of the tool in the architectural design process.

First,some fashional user_based design concepts were reviewd, and their shortcomings and disadvantages were futher analysed in today environmental sustainability context.Then taking into account of users behavior,emotion and concept impacts enacted throughout the use phase of products, a series of strategies were outlined,such as user-product relationship empathic design, service_based local common products design, edification design and participatory product redesign. These strategies will be helpful to prolong product lifecycle through establishing intimate emotion connection, reduce resource consumption through lowering the total amount of personal products,deeply change users' daily behavior and enhance users' environmental consciousness through educational function of product semiotic,and make users have a substantial role in product redesign to strengthen the reuse of the abandoned parts through open design and facilitating disassembly.

All prototypes have been based on the unique lift type blade system consisting of sailcloth material which allows for the turbine to operate with variable blade pitch and profile camber. The latest prototype is presented along with a detailed discussion of fundamental design aspects such as the sail blades, frame tower, alternator, and transmission systems. The VosREC headquarters for research, development and testing is located in a remote, rural, and non-electrified village in Nicaragua. This location provides researchers with the unique opportunity to experience and observe first-hand how renewable energy technologies can be applied to improve quality of life for people living without connection to national electricity grids. Aspects and benefits of the "open source hardware" approach are presented along with a discussion on implementation models, "bottom-up", empowerment and self-organization.

ID PRODUCT PLATFORMS
AB The generational variety index (GVI) helps identify the components of product variants that are most likely to require redesign in the future. These components can then be embedded with the flexibility required for them to be easily modifiable; the remaining components can be designed into a platform. This paper describes the application of the GVI technique in studying the evolution of the Apple iPhone, which was first released in 2007 and has since undergone multiple redesigns. The analysis includes the five generations of the iPhone (original, 3G, 3GS, 4, and 4S) and focuses primarily on mechanical sub-systems. The results of the analysis and subsequent design recommendations are compared with the actual design evolution of the iPhone product line. For certain subsystems, this comparison reveals a divergence in Apple's design decision-making from the evolution recommended by the GVI technique. Limitations include its retrospective nature and the use of only publicly available data.

AB This paper presents the development and testing of an open and flexible embedded system applied to positioning and telecontrol (OFESAPO) for outdoor applications. The system is composed of a control center (CC) and a set of remote terminal units (RTUs); the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 60870-5 series has been chosen for communication among them. This is a standard protocol of real-time telecontrol applications. The CC is a personal computer, and the RTUs are based on open hardware and software. The RTU hardware is an embedded system, i.e., a system-on-chip-type design using field-programmable gate array that has been programmed with the open-core LEON running Linux operating system. For prototyping, the GR-XC3S-1500 board has been used. As there is no open source code available for the IEC standard protocols, an open source code has also been implemented. Hence, both the hardware and the software are open source in OFESAPO. Several tests have been made to show the system's limitations and the suitability for real-time applications. A prototype has also been tested in a real environment, where the real position of two moving RTUs was shown by a CC using Google Map.

TI Update on the third international stroke trial (IST-3) of thrombolysis
   for acute ischaemic stroke and baseline features of the 3035 patients
   recruited
SO TRIALS
LA English
DT Article
ID ALTEPLASE
AB Background: Intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) is approved in Europe for use in patients with acute ischaemic stroke who meet strictly defined criteria. IST-3 sought to improve the external validity and precision of the estimates of the overall treatment effects (efficacy and safety) of rtPA in acute ischaemic stroke, and to determine whether a wider range of patients might benefit.
   Design: International, multi-centre, prospective, randomized, open, blinded endpoint (PROBE) trial of intravenous rtPA in acute ischaemic stroke. Suitable patients had to be assessed and able to start treatment within 6 hours of developing symptoms, and brain imaging must have excluded intracranial haemorrhage and stroke mimics.
   Results: The initial pilot phase was double blind and then, on 01/08/2003, changed to an open design. Recruitment began on 05/05/2000 and closed on 31/07/2011, by which time 3035 patients had been included, only 61 (2%) of whom met the criteria for the 2003 European approval for thrombolysis. 1617 patients were aged over 80 years at trial entry. The analysis plan will be finalised, without reference to the unblinded data, and published before the trial data are unblinded in early 2012. The main trial results will be presented at the European Stroke Conference in Lisbon in May 2012 with the aim to publish simultaneously in a peer-reviewed journal. The trial result will be presented in the context of an updated Cochrane systematic review. We also intend to include the trial data in an individual patient data meta-analysis of all the relevant randomised trials.
   Conclusion: The data from the trial will: improve the external validity and precision of the estimates of the overall treatment effects (efficacy and safety) of iv rtPA in acute ischaemic stroke; provide: new evidence on the balance of risk and benefit of intravenous rtPA among types of patients who do not clearly meet the terms of the current EU approval; and, provide the first large-scale randomised evidence on effects in patients over 80, an age group which had largely been excluded from previous acute stroke trials.

AB Objective To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral miglustat treatment in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type III. The primary outcome was efficacy with improvement or stabilization in at least two domains of Vineland Adaptative Behavior Scales at 6 months. The secondary outcome measured the evolution of other cognitive tests at 12 months. The safety and tolerability were assessed throughout the study.
   Study design This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, monocenter, institutional, phase IIb to III study. In case of efficacy at 6 months, the study would go on for another 6 months on an open design with all patients receiving miglustat. In the absence of efficacy at 6 months, the trial had to be continued for 6 more months with the initial design.
   Results After 6 months, efficacy was not superior in patients with miglustat. The independent review board confirmed continuing the study until 12 months.
   Conclusion Miglustat treatment was not associated with any improvement/stabilization in behavior problems in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type III. Miglustat has an acceptable safety profile. However, the study has confirmed that miglustat is able to pass through the blood-brain barrier without significantly decreasing ganglioside levels.

AB Photonic technology is becoming an increasingly attractive solution to the problems facing today's electronic chip-scale interconnection networks. Recent progress in silicon photonics research has enabled the demonstration of all the necessary optical building blocks for creating extremely high-bandwidth density and energy-efficient links for on-chip and off-chip communications. From the feasibility and architecture perspective however, photonics represents a dramatic paradigm shift from traditional electronic network designs due to fundamental differences in how electronics and photonics function and behave. As a result of these differences, new modeling and analysis methods must be employed in order to properly realize a functional photonic chip-scale interconnect design. In this paper, we present a methodology for characterizing and modeling fundamental photonic building blocks which can subsequently be combined to form full photonic network architectures. We also describe a set of tools which can be utilized to assess the physical-layer and system-level performance properties of a photonic network. The models and tools are integrated in a novel open-source design and simulation environment. We present a case study of two different photonic networks-on-chip to demonstrate how our improved understanding and modeling of the physical-layer details of photonic communications can be used to better understand the system-level performance impact.

AB Although potentiostats are the foundation of modern electrochemical research, they have seen relatively little application in resource poor settings, such as undergraduate laboratory courses and the developing world. One reason for the low penetration of potentiostats is their cost, as even the least expensive commercially available laboratory potentiostats sell for more than one thousand dollars. An inexpensive electrochemical workstation could thus prove useful in educational labs, and increase access to electrochemistry-based analytical techniques for food, drug and environmental monitoring. With these motivations in mind, we describe here the CheapStat, an inexpensive (<$80), open-source (software and hardware), hand-held potentiostat that can be constructed by anyone who is proficient at assembling circuits. This device supports a number of potential waveforms necessary to perform cyclic, square wave, linear sweep and anodic stripping voltammetry. As we demonstrate, it is suitable for a wide range of applications ranging from food-and drug-quality testing to environmental monitoring, rapid DNA detection, and educational exercises. The device's schematics, parts lists, circuit board layout files, sample experiments, and detailed assembly instructions are available in the supporting information and are released under an open hardware license.

AB Embedded systems are a fundamental part of almost all human activities. This, coupled with the availability of free and open software development tools, opens up great possibilities for developing countries as they are not large capital investments needed for the conception, design, and manufacture of these systems. However, currently very few universities offer courses for building the skills necessary to achieve a marketable product, increasing dependence on Asian technology. This paper presents a methodology for teaching embedded system design using open hardware and software tools.

AB A type of a plasmonic waveguide has been proposed featuring an "open" design that is easy to manufacture, simple to excite and offers convenient access to a plasmonic mode. Optical properties of photonic bandgap (PBG) plasmonic waveguides are investigated experimentally by leakage radiation microscopy and numerically using the finite element method confirming photonic bandgap guidance in a broad spectral range. Propagation and localization characteristics of a PBG plasmonic waveguide have been discussed as a function of the wavelength of operation, waveguide core size, and the number of ridges in the periodic reflector for fundamental and higher order plasmonic modes of the waveguide.

AB Norway has the largest salmon-farming industry in the world, an industry that is still growing, and in recent years production of marine species like Atlantic cod has also increased. At the same time, Norway has the world's largest wild stock of Atlantic salmon and has fjord systems and ocean areas rich in wild marine fish species which form the basis of a large fishing industry. As the aquaculture industry grows and diversifies, there is concern about the potential effects of pathogens spreading from farmed fish to wild populations. The overall health situation in Norwegian aquaculture is good, but some pathogens are not controlled effectively. In particular, salmon lice produced in farms may cause problems for wild salmonids and other parasites may be abundant too. Also, viral diseases in Atlantic salmon and bacterial diseases in Atlantic cod give rise to several disease outbreaks annually. The open design of most aquaculture systems allows the transmission of pathogens from the environment or from wild fish to the farmed fish. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of current knowledge of disease interaction and pathogen exchange between farmed and wild fish populations, with emphasis on Norwegian condition. In addition, the paper contains an evaluation of research methods that would be useful in expanding knowledge of pathogen exchange between wild and farmed fish, and in surveys of diseases in wild fish populations. The impact of pathogen transfer from farmed fish to economically important wild fish populations is assessed together with risk analysis considering possible consequences of pathogen exchange between farmed and wild fish. Finally, the review contains suggestions for future research that will increase the knowledge in the field. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Acupuncture; Antidepressant; Augmentation; Depression
ID CONTROLLED-TRIAL; CLINICAL-TRIALS
AB Background: Acupuncture is widely used for treating major depressive disorder (MDD). There is evidence supporting acupuncture as an antidepressant monotherapy, but its efficacy as augmentation in antidepressant partial and non-responders has not been well-investigated.
   Methods: Thirty subjects (47% female, mean age 48 +/- 11 years) with a history of SCID-diagnosed MDD and partial or non-response after 8 weeks of antidepressant therapy were assigned 8 weeks of standardized 30-min open acupuncture augmentation sessions on a weekly (n = 24) or twice-weekly (n = 6) basis. Change in the Hamilton-D-17 score was the primary outcome measure, and response rates (based on HAM-D-17 score improvement of >= 50%) the secondary outcome.
   Results: Twenty subjects (40% female: 18 in weekly and 2 in twice-weekly treatment) completed the study. In the intent-to-treat (ITT) sample (N = 30), HAM-D-17 scores decreased from 18.5 +/- 3.8 to 11.2 +/- 5.3 in the weekly group (p < 0.001), and from 18.5 +/- 3.3 to 11.8 +/- 4.8 in the twice-weekly group (p = 0.03). Improvement did not differ significantly between treatment arms (p = 0.76). Response rates were 47% for all ITT subjects, 50% for the weekly group and 33% for the twice-weekly group (p =0.66). The most common side effects included soreness/pain (n = 7), bruising (n = 4), and mild bleeding (n = 1) at the needle site. One subject discontinued because of side effects (pain).
   Limitations: Open design, small sample, polypharmacy with antidepressants.
   Conclusions: Once or twice-weekly acupuncture augmentation was safe, well-tolerated and effective in antidepressant partial and non-responders, suggesting good feasibility in outpatient settings. Replication in controlled trials is warranted. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Photoactive Ruthenium Nitrosyls as NO Donors: How To Sensitize Them
   toward Visible Light
SO ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH

   LIGANDS
AB Nitric oxide (NO) can induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) at micromolar or higher doses. Although cell death via NO-induced apoptosis has been studied quite extensively, the targeted delivery of such doses of NO to infected or malignant tissues has not been achieved. The primary obstacle is indiscriminate NO release from typical systemic donors such as glycerin trinitrate: once administered, the drug travels throughout the body, and NO is released through a variety of enzymatic, redox, and pH-dependent pathways.
   Photosensitive NO donors have the ability to surmount this difficulty through the use of light as a localized stimulus for NO delivery. The potential of the method has prompted synthetic research efforts toward new NO donors for use as photo-pharmaceuticals in the treatment of infections and malignancies. Over the past few years, we have designed and synthesized several metal nitrosyls (NO complexes of metals) that rapidly release NO when exposed to low-power (milliwatt or greater) light of various wavelengths. Among them, the ruthenium nitrosyls exhibit exceptional stability in biological media. However, typical ruthenium nitrosyls release NO upon exposure to UV light, which is hardly suitable for phototherapy. By following a few novel synthetic strategies, we have overcome this problem and synthesized a variety of ruthenium nitrosyls that strongly absorb light in the 400-600-nm range and rapidly release NO under such illumination. In this Account, we describe our progress in designing photoactive ruthenium nitrosyls as visible-light-sensitive NO donors.
   Our research has shown that alteration of the ligands, in terms of (i) donor atoms, (ii) extent of conjugation, and (iii) substituents on the ligand frames, sensitizes the final ruthenium nitrosyls toward visible light in a predictable fashion. Density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations provide guidance in this "smart design" of ligands. We have also demonstrated that direct attachment of dye molecules as light-harvesting antennas also sensitize ruthenium nitrosyls to visible light, and TDDFT calculations provide insight into the mechanisms of sensitization by this technique. The fluorescence of the dye ligands makes these NO donors "trackable" within cellular matrices. Selected ruthenium nitrosyls have been used to deliver NO to cellular targets to induce apoptosis. Our open-design strategies allow the isolation of a variety of these ruthenium nitrosyls, depending on the choices of the ligand frames and dyes. These designed nitrosyls will thus be valuable in the future endeavor of synthesizing novel pharmaceuticals for phototherapy.

AB Purpose: At 1.5 T, real-time MRI of joint movement has been shown to be feasible. However, 7 T, provides higher SNR and thus an improved potential for parallel imaging acceleration. The purpose of this work was to build an open, U-shaped eight-channel transmit/receive microstrip coil for 7 T MRI to enable high-resolution and real-time imaging of the moving ankle joint.
   Methods: A U-shaped eight-channel transmit/receive array for the human ankle was built. S-parameters and g-factor were measured. SAR calculations of different ankle postures were performed to ensure patient safety. Inhomogeneities in the transmit field consequent to the open design were compensated for by the use of static RF shimming. High-resolution and real-time imaging was performed in human volunteers.
   Results: The presented array showed good performance with regard to patient comfort and image quality. High acceleration factors of up to 4 are feasible without visible acceleration artifacts. Reasonable image homogeneity was achieved with RF shimming.
   Conclusions: Open, noncylindrical designs for transmit/receive coils are practical at 7 T and real-time imaging of the moving joint is feasible with the presented coil design. (C) 2011 American Association of Physicists in Medicine. [DOI: 10.1118/1.3553399]

AB Background: The human papillomavirus (HPV)-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine is immunogenic, has a clinically acceptable safety profile, and prevents incident and persistent HPV-16/18 infection and cervical precancerous lesions. This study (NCT00552279) evaluated the vaccine when administered according to an alternative dosing schedule (0-1-12 months) compared with the standard dosing schedule (0-1-6 months).
   Methods: The study was of randomized open design and was conducted at multiple centers in Europe. Healthy women aged 15 to 25 years were randomized (1: 1) to receive HPV-16/18 vaccine according to the standard schedule at months 0, 1, and 6 (n = 401) or an alternative schedule at months 0, 1, and 12 (n = 403). HPV-16 and -18 antibodies were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at months 0, 2, and 7 or 13 (depending on group); noninferiority evaluation was performed sequentially for seroconversion rates and geometric mean antibody titers. Primary analysis of immunogenicity was based on the according-to-protocol cohort. Vaccine safety and reactogenicity were assessed on the total vaccinated cohort.
   Results: Predefined noninferiority criteria were met 1 month after the third vaccine dose when the HPV-16/18 vaccine was administered according to the 0-1-12 month schedule compared with the 0-1-6 month schedule in terms of seroconversion rates for HPV-16 (100% and 100%) and HPV-18 (99.7% and 100%) and geometric mean antibody titers for HPV-16 (11884.7 and 10311.9 ELISA units/mL) and HPV-18 (4501.3 and 3963.6 ELISA units/mL), respectively. The HPV-16/18 vaccine had a clinically acceptable safety profile when administered according to either schedule.
   Conclusions: The third dose of the HPV-16/18 vaccine can be administered any time between 6 and 12 months after the first dose, with adequate immunogenicity and a clinically acceptable safety profile.

AB We investigated the effect of BoNT/A injection on hip lateralisation in children with bilateral spastic cerebral palsy and bilateral adductor spasticity. Pelvic radiographs using Reimers' migration index (MI) were evaluated from 27 children (n = 9 females, n = 18 males; mean age 5.2 +/- 1.96 years; range: 2-10 years; initial MI <50%) with bilateral spastic cerebral palsy over a time period of 2 years. All received injections of BoNT/A (Dysport (R)) every 12 weeks with a dose of 30 Units per kilogram body weight into adductor and medial hamstring muscles on both sides. The MI was calculated before treatment and after 1 and 2 years. The mean MI increased from 25.5% (range: 0-48) to 26.7 % (+1.2 %, range: 0-79) on the right side and from 28.0 % (range: 0-40) to 30.6 % (+2.6 %, range: 3-84) on the left side over 2 years, respectively. Hips of one patient dislocated bilaterally. The mean MI remained stable over 2 years. Although a specific BoNT/A effect cannot be proven because of the open design of this study, we provide strong evidence that the MI can be kept stable for a time period of 2 years under non-surgical management including therapy with BoNT/A even in CP patients with a high risk for hip dislocation.

AB Preoperative and postoperative ion concentrations were measured in 29 metal-on-metal, large-diameter head total hip arthroplasty (LDH-THA) patients. Mean chromium, cobalt (Co), and titanium levels from LDH-THA were 1.3, 2.2, and 2.7 mu g/L at 12 months. The open femoral head design showed significantly higher Co concentrations than the closed design (3.0 vs 1.8 mu g/L, P =.037). Compared with previously published ion levels from a hip resurfacing system presenting the same bearing characteristics, Co levels were significantly higher in LDH-THA (2.2 vs 0.7 mu g/L, P <.001). This study has demonstrated that the addition of a sleeve with modular junctions and an open femoral head design of LDH-THA causes more Co release than bearing surface wear (157% and 67%, respectively). Even if no pathologic metal ion threshold level has been determined, efforts should be made to minimize its release. We recommend modification or abandonment of the modular junction and femoral head open design for this specific LDH-THA system.

DE Swarm robotics; Mobile robotics; Embedded Linux
AB In this paper we describe the implementation of a Linux extension board for the e-puck educational mobile robot, designed to enhance the computation, memory and networking performance of the robot at very low cost. The extension board is based on a 32-bit ARM9 microprocessor and provides wireless network support. The ARM9 extension board runs in parallel with the dsPIC microprocessor on the e-puck motherboard with communication between the two via an SPI bus. The extension board is designed to handle computationally intensive image processing, wireless communication and high-level intelligent robot control algorithms, while the dsPIC handles low-level sensor interfacing, data processing and motor control. The extension board runs an embedded Linux operating system, along with a Debian-based port of the root file system stored in a Micro SD card. The extended e-puck robot platform requires minimal effort to integrate the well-known open-source robot control framework Player and, when placed within a TCP/IP networked infrastructure, provides a powerful and flexible platform for experimental swarm robotics research.

AB This paper introduces a new open CNC system for winding machines which can overcome the shortcomings the traditional winding machine existed, such as the low control-accuracy, the low speed and the poor quality of its product. The system takes Microprocessor MC68HC000 as the core and its working mode is centralized control and time-sharing processing. The highest drive pulse of the system reaches 500 KPPS and the drive aufloesung can be as high as 0.001mna/Pulse. So, the system software, together with the winding machines' development kits and operating software, can provide an open design platform of the controller for the winding machine, and it may cater to the market's needs for winding machines.

We present Fab FM, an open-source FM radio that integrates an electronic circuit board, laser-cut wood, and fabric. We describe a workshop in which participants designed and built their own Fab FM variants, modifying the form, materials, and behavior of the radio. Drawing from this experience, we discuss three themes: the issues involved in working across design domains, the ways in which design can serve as source code, and the difference between open-source and hackable. We present potential business models for Fab FM, and discuss the possibilities that digital fabrication offers for a more diverse landscape of high-tech products.

AB Secure processors have become increasingly important for trustworthy computing as security breaches escalate. By providing hardware-level protection, a secure processor ensures a safe computing environment where confidential data and applications can be protected against both hardware and software attacks. In this paper, we present a single-chip secure processor model and demonstrate rapid prototyping of the secure processor on the OpenSPARC FPGA platform. OpenSPARC T1 is an industry-grade, open-source, FPGA-synthesizable general-purpose microprocessor originally developed by Sun Microsystems, now acquired by Oracle. It is a multi-core, multi-threaded 64-bit processor with open-source hardware, including the microprocessor core, as well as system software that can be freely modified by researchers. We modify the OpenSPARC T1 processor by adding security modules: an AES engine, a TRNG and a memory integrity tree. These enhancements enable security features like memory encryption and memory integrity verification. By prototyping this single-chip secure processor on the FPGA platform, we find that the OpenSPARC T1 FPGA platform has many advantages for secure processor research. Our prototyping demonstrates that additional modules can be added quickly and easily and they add little resource overhead to the base OpenSPARC processor.

AB Based on previous classical learning models created for animation and digital artists, this work presents a framework that stimulates creativity by divergent thinking without compromising technology and specialization.
   The classical learning model focuses on specialization by utilizing dedicated technologies and devices. Although this approach has proven to be successful in the past because it is highly skill oriented, it promotes directive teaching practice through mainly audio-visual content. Even though the technology is specialized, it is also limited and because of the empirical nature of the process the artists develop linear, sometimes even convergent thinking.
   Open hardware technologies provide first-hand fabrication experience in a workshop environment embracing interdisciplinary collaboration and information sharing. The aesthetic experience is perceived through vision, sound, smell and touch while the interactive experience is created by sensors, micro-controllers, kinetic sculptures, puppets and installations connected to virtual 3D worlds. This kind of learning environment in conjunction with the emotional interest enhances the capacity to achieve original content and ideas that have value, while the divergent thinking helps to find solutions in various areas and industries.

AB The use of technology by children from lower levels of education is very dependent on the utility perception that teachers may encounter in their use. But even those teachers who want to innovate experience many obstacles. On one hand, the difficulties they have to use certain technologies and on the other hand the difficulties faced by schools to invest in acquiring the necessary equipment. Teachers need to be created facilitating conditions for technology upgrades, to help them reach a personal motivation level for its use. To resolve the second difficulty it must be created an awareness that there are already several alternatives, including the use of open hardware and electronic equipment at low cost, combined with the use of free software. The construction of tangible objects using open hardware and software to create a technology alliance will facilitate the diffusion of use and enable children to explore new forms of narrative, usually associated with higher levels of education.

AB Increasing cross-influence of technology on education and modern pedagogical approaches, could be integrated to act as an academic whole in the universities for the improvement of teaching-learning processes. By means of virtual laboratories, teachers and students can use technological means and web infrastructure to overcome classroom and laboratory limitations in equipment, personnel and space, additionally, by the guidance of correct pedagogical strategies, they can fulfill requirements of the education process not fully covered at classroom, during course time. Through proper design considerations, the operation of a virtual laboratory can be based on open-free hardware and software resources currently being used worldwide and widely known, available without any cost. A structural framework for the implementation of a virtual laboratory on electronic instrumentation to be supported on free open resources is proposed. The proposed framework shows major economic advantages over other virtual laboratories based on commercial solutions; budget constraints due to high investments in license and proprietary hardware purchases are reduced. Long term sustainability is favored because of the growing worldwide efforts and communities continuously providing support, sharing resources and developing new materials related with the project.

AB There is growing student interest in renewable energy and electric vehicles. Energy storage is a critical technology for electric vehicles and to some extent for intermittent renewable energy sources. Battery life, performance, and cost remain a barrier to widespread use of battery energy storage. Increasing the number of students researching these technologies would increase the likelihood of progress.
   The process of testing batteries to characterize performance and durability typically requires the use of specialized equipment that may be beyond the budget for many educators. Hence, many interested students may not have access to the tools to perform these experiments.
   To remedy this, we have begun the development of an open source battery-testing platform that can be built at a fraction of the cost of commercial systems. Furthermore, the development of the testing platform provides educational opportunities for students.

AB This paper describes a capstone project whose objective was to design, build and successfully test an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with real-time video surveillance capabilities. The student team was composed of seven students within an aeronautical concentration of their Mechanical Engineering Technology program. The students designed and built a UAV capable of flying under direct manual control and indirect automatic control. Direct manual control was accomplished via a model radio-control transmitter, while indirect control accomplished via the onboard autopilot system. Programmable autonomous flight software, utilizing global positioning satellites (GPS), controls the autopilot system. A ground control station (GCS) sends and receives telemetry from a 2.4GHz modem located in the UAV. The GCS utilized Paparazzi, an open-source hardware and software autopilot platform, which allows mission specific flight plans to be created, uploaded, and executed and monitored during the UAV's flight. Real-time video from the UAV is transmitted to the GCS via an antenna and receiver. This comprehensive design and build project, concluding with successful test flights, enhanced the student learning and performance during the course of the project. Assessment data gathered by the project faculty mentor are provided in the paper.

AB We present SensLAB, a very large scale wireless sensor network testbed(1). SensLAB is distributed among 4 sites having different topologies and consists of 1024 wireless nodes based on open source hardware & software. Within a given site, each one of the 256 nodes is able to communicate via its radio interface (868Mhz or 2.4Ghz) to its neighbors. Furthermore, every sensor node is potentially configurable as a sink node and can exchange data with any other sink node of the whole SensLAB testbed and/or Internet application. The testbed is designed to achieve reproducibility of experimentation, while also supporting evaluation of protocols and applications in real world settings. It allows to monitor transparently, i.e., without any insertion/modification within the code, any deployed application in terms of energy consumption or radio activity. The main benefits of SensLAB for the users are to reduce the costs in terms of: infrastructure investment, maintenance cost and operating cost. With SensLAB you can be up and running minutes after you are assigned an account! SensLAB's main and most important goal is to offer an accurate open access multi-users scientific tool to support the design, development, tuning, and experimentation of real large-scale sensor network applications. During this demo, we propose to demonstrate the interests of the SensLAB testbed by developing and running two experimental scenarii that highlight the services offered by SensLAB.

AB Modern computer architectures are founded on multi-core processors. In order to efficiently process network traffic, it is necessary to dynamically split high-speed packet streams across cores based on the monitoring goal. Most network adapters are multi-core aware but offer limited facilities for assigning packets to processor cores. In this paper we introduce a hybrid traffic analysis framework that leverages flexible packet balancing mechanisms available on recent 10 Gbit commodity network adapters not yet exploited by operating systems. The main contribution of this paper is an open source hardware-assisted software layer for dynamically configuring packet balancing policies in order to fully exploit multi-core systems and enable 10 Gbit wire-speed network traffic analysis.

AB Sherpa is a general purpose modeling and fitting application written in Python. The dynamism of Python allows Sherpa to be a powerful and extensible software package ready for the modern challenges of data analysis. Primarily developed for the Chandra Interactive Analysis of Observations (CIAO) package, it provides a flexible environment for resolving spectral and image properties, analyzing time series, and modeling generic types of data. Complex model expressions are supported using Sherpa's general purpose definition syntax. Sherpa's parameterized data modeling is achieved using robust optimization methods implementing the forward fitting technique. Sherpa includes functions to calculate goodness-of-fit and parameter confidence limits. CPU intensive routines are written in C++/FORTRAN. But since all other data structures are contained in Python modules, users can easily add their own data structures, models, statistics or optimization methods to Sherpa. We will introduce a scripted example that highlights Sherpa's ability to estimate energy and photon flux errors using simulations. The draws from these simulations, accessible as NumPy ndarrays, can be sampled from uni-variate and multi-variate normal distributions and can be binned and visualized with simple high level functions. We will demonstrate how Sherpa can be extended with user-defined model and statistic classes written in Python. Sherpa's open design even allows users to incorporate prior statistics derived from the source model.

ID ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY
AB Design for (every)one is a macro framework that attempts to identify, share and use 'hidden solutions' in community-based rehabilitation contexts and translate them into disruptive assistive devices built with local resources or appropriate technology. Within healthcare contexts, local solutions are frequently more effective as they reflect the physical, emotional and cognitive needs of specific patients and engage all stakeholders in a specific local context. By using open horizontal innovation networks, where assistive devices can be easily shared and physically hacked by other allied health professionals, general patterns can be detected and translated into standard universal design objects. This generative design thinking approach is more than feasible with digital trends such as crowd sourcing, user-generated content and peer production. Cheap and powerful prototyping tools have become easier to use by non-engineers; it turns them into users as well as self-manufacturers of their personal assistive artefacts. This paper discusses the different aspects of this open innovation process within a 'design for disability' context and suggests the first steps in an iterative co-design methodology that brings together expertise from professional designers, occupational therapists, patients and other stakeholders. The overall aim is to gain more insights into designing qualitative occupational experiences for disabled users.

AB This paper presents the design of a digitally fabricated, customizable line of furniture and casework objects that leverage parametric technology and social networking to produce a highly collaborative distributed digital fabrication workflow. It describes how a furniture system, serving as an apprehensible model for architecture, was designed concurrently with the networked, multi-agent workflow that manufactures it and the layered user input that defines it. The furniture object designs are inextricably linked to their fabrication by a distributed network of small fabricators that supplant the single large manufacturer, and to their open outcomes that balance professional design expertise with user input. The paper concludes with describing how this model challenges the architectural profession's prevailing focus on the transactional and object oriented capabilities of recent digital innovations. By using such tools to design the objects within their systemic and networked relationships, architects might successfully create outcomes that better respond to society's increasingly complex demands.

AB This chapter introduces a component design of application logic in special type of information system architecture called Open Design Architecture for Round Trip Engineering (ODARTE). This architecture supports model-driven development and integrates information system design with its executable form. It is possible to extract design anytime, modify it, and load back to change the activity and behavior of information system. In this approach, the application logic represents solely functionality and can be described either by sequential model of Windows Workflow Foundation or by UML activity or interaction diagrams. This approach allows creation of flexible and modifiable meta-design of application logic. Finally, an experimental simulation is shown demonstrating the effect of proposal which relates to pilot version of runtime environment for ODARTE support.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and micro air vehicles (MAV) are already intensively used in geodetic applications. State of the art autonomous systems are however geared towards the application area in safe and obstacle-free altitudes greater than 30 meters. Applications at lower altitudes still require a human pilot. A new application field will be the reconstruction of structures and buildings, including the facades and roofs, with semi-autonomous MAVs. Ongoing research in the MAV robotics field is focusing on enabling this system class to operate at lower altitudes in proximity to nearby obstacles and humans. PIXHAWK is an open source and open hardware toolkit for this purpose. The quadrotor design is optimized for onboard computer vision and can connect up to four cameras to its onboard computer. The validity of the system design is shown with a fully autonomous capture flight along a building.

AB In the last years the functionality and type of UAV-systems increased fast, but unfortunately these systems are hardly available for researchers in some cases. A simple and low-cost solution was developed to build an autonomous aerial surveying airplane, which can fulfil the necessities ( aerial photographs with very-high resolution) of other departments at the university and very useful and practical for teaching photogrammetry.
   The base was a commercial, remote controlled model airplane and an open-source GPS/IMU system (MatrixPilot) was adapted to achieve the semi-automatic or automatic stabilization and navigation of the model airplane along predefined trajectory. The firmware is completely open-source and easily available on the website of the project.
   The first used camera system was a low-budget, low-quality video camera, which could provide only 1.2 megapixel photographs or low resolution video depending on the light conditions and the desired spatial resolution.
   A field measurement test was carried out with the described system: the aerial surveying of an undiscovered archaeological site, signed by a crop-mark in mountain Pilis (Hungary).

AB The success of a vehicle seat is defined in large part by its acceptability to users and compliance with applicable regulations. Simultaneously satisfying both of these objectives can be challenging, and it is the goal of the designer to balance the requirements of each to optimise the design. Quantifying the many sources of variability, including that which results from human users and manufacturers, is necessary for achieving satisfactory and predictable results. Here, the relationship between meeting FMVSS 202a, a new regulation related to head restraints in the USA, and achieving user acceptability is explored as an example of a vehicle seat design scenario presenting conflicting objectives. Sources of variability in this problem are identified as originating from test manikin installers, customers, and manufacturers. The impact of variability resulting from these sources on simultaneously achieving the stated objectives is investigated.

LA English

DE Produsage; Actor-network; Skills; Symmetry; Circulation; Relationality
AB In 1this paper we investigate produsage using Actor-Network Theory with a focus on (produsage) skills, their development, and transformation. We argue that produsage is not a model that determines a change in the traditional consumption/production paradigm through a series of essential preconditions (such as open participation, peer-sharing, or common ownership). Rather, we explain produsage as the open-ended result of a series of heterogeneous actor-networking strategies. In this view, the so-called preconditions do not explain produsage but have to be explained along with its establishment as an actor-network. Drawing on this approach, we discuss a case study of an open hardware project: the Arduino board, and we develop a perspective that maps the skills of human and non-human entities in produsage actor-networks, showing how skills are symmetrical, relational, and circulating.

AB The Lead Cooled Fast Reactor (LFR) is one of the six concepts selected by the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) as candidates for the long term evolution of nuclear technology. Due to the significant technological innovations it implies, the European Sustainable Nuclear Energy Technology Platform (SNETP) recognized that LFR complete development requires the realization of a demonstration plant (DEMO) as a fundamental intermediate step. In this paper, a preliminary approach to the simulation of DEMO primary system dynamic behavior is presented.
   The need of investigating reactor responses to temperature transients has led to a simplified model reckoning with all the main feedbacks following a reactivity change in the core, which have been calculated by means of ERANOS deterministic code ver. 2.1 coupled with JEFF3.1 data library.
   A lumped-parameter approach has been adopted to treat both neutronics and thermal-hydraulics: indeed, the point-kinetics approximation has been employed and an average-temperature heat-exchange model has been implemented. Due to the latter, the dynamic mechanical behavior of DEMO core -modeled as a cylinder- has been addressed by considering expansions and contractions instantaneous with temperature variations, i.e. neglecting mass inertia effects.
   The very simple linearized model treated in the present work turns out to be a helpful tool in this early phase of the DEMO pre-design, in which all the system specifications are still considered to be open design parameters, since it allows a relatively quick, qualitative analysis of dynamics and stability aspects that cannot be left aside when refining or even finalizing the system configuration.

ID PASSWORD AUTHENTICATION
AB The recently reported security issue possibly compromising the security tokens sold by a major vendor of two factor authentication (2FA) solutions (Schneier, 2011) demonstrates the importance of the basic principle of using an open design for security solutions (Saltzer and Schroeder, 1974). In particular, the safety of such devices should not be based on the use of a secret algorithm or seed value to generate a sequence of one-time passwords (OTP) inside the security token. Instead, we argue in favour of using an open design using pre-generated sequences of OTP that are stored encrypted on the security token. Here, the safety of the solution only relies on the confidentiality of the decryption key and not the design of the solution itself. We illustrate our argumentation by describing a respective authentication scheme and a prototype based on an open design, the latter being used as the basis for the security analysis.

AB Requirements for modern and future control systems for large projects like International Linear Collider demand high availability for control system components. Recently telecom industry came up with a great open hardware specification - Advanced Telecom Computing Architecture (ATCA). This specification is aimed for better reliability, availability and serviceability. Since its first market appearance in 2004. ATCA platform has shown tremendous growth and proved to be stable and well represented by a number of vendors. ATCA is an industry standard for highly available systems. On the other hand Service Availability Forum, a consortium of leading communications and computing companies, describes interaction between hardware and software. SAF defines a set of specifications such as Hardware Platform Interface, Application Interface Specification. SAF specifications provide extensive description of highly available systems, services and their interfaces. Originally aimed for telecom applications, these specifications can be used for accelerator controls software as well. This study describes benefits of using these specifications and their possible adoption to accelerator control systems. It is demonstrated how EPICS Redundant IOC was extended using Hardware Platform Interface specification, which made it possible to utilize benefits of the ATCA platform. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

   The horizontal axis of the 430,0 m long and 18,0 m wide bridge has a radius of curvature of R = 460,0 m. The bridge is designed as an "extrados bridge," representing an intermediate form between girder bridges and cable-stayed bridges. Structural spans of the bridge are 65 + 100 + 100 + 100 + 65 = 430 m. In the cross section the bridge is a mono-cellular, box-shaped, longitudinally prestressed concrete girder; H = 2,70 m, with classic prestressing tendons inside and additional exterior extrados cables over the low pylons.
   The conceptual design won the open design competition in 2004 and the final tender design was completed in March 2005. The construction of the innovatively designed "extrados bridge" started in November 2005, and the bridge was opened for traffic in May 2007.

AB Traditionally the protection of intellectual property is regarded as a precondition for value capture. The rise of open source (OS) software and OS tangible products, so-called open design, has challenged this understanding. Openness is often regarded as a dichotomous variable (open-source vs. closed-source) and it is assumed that online developer communities demand full opening of the product's source. In this paper we will explore openness as a gradual and multi-dimensional concept. We carried out an Internet survey (N = 270) among participants of 20 open design communities in the domain of IT hardware and consumer electronics. We find that open design projects pursue complex strategies short of complete openness and that communities value openness of software more highly than openness of hardware. Our findings suggest that open design companies can successfully implement strategies of partial openness to safeguard value capture without alienating their developer community.

AB The study attempted to identify clinical variables which could predict the response to a second-generation antipsychotic treatment during acute episodes among schizophrenic patients. Socio-demographic, premorbid and clinical variables were studied in a population of 95 diagnosed with schizophrenia, as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSMIV), during an acute treated phase, in a multicentre prospective study. Patients were assigned to olanzapine or risperidone treatment in an open design. Clinical evaluations were performed at DO, D42 and D180. Good response to treatment was defined as a Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) reduction greater than 20% and a Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) score lower than 35. Univariate analysis revealed earlier age at onset of schizophrenia and earlier age at first prescription of antipsychotic among non-responders compared with good responders at D42. Non-responders also had a clinical profile at the onset of antipsychotic treatment characterised by more severe forms of the acute episode as shown by higher scores at the positive, general and overall PANSS scale and on CGI-S and BPRS scores. With a multivariate logistic regression model, age at onset and overall duration of illness remained the only clinical criteria identified as predictors of response to antipsychotic treatment at D42. Clinical variables do not clearly appear to be good predictors of treatment efficacy. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aims. The aim of the study was to determine whether a high dose of atorvastatin lowers blood pressure (BP) in normolipemic patients with well controlled primary arterial hypertension and if this effect is associated with alteration of biomarkers of endothelial function and oxidative stress. In this open-label study, normolipemic patients (n=56) were randomized in the proportion of 2: 1 to receive atorvastatin 80 mg daily for 3 months (statin-treated, ST n=39), or to previous therapy (statin-free, SF). BP was measured using a 24-h ambulatory BP measurement device. Plasma levels of 6-keto-PGF(1 alpha) (prostacyclin metabolite), serum nitric oxide (NO) and levels of autoantibodies immunoglobulin G against oxidatively modified low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) were measured. Major findings. The mean change in systolic BP and diastolic BP for ST was -5.7 mmHg (95% CI -4.1 to -7.2 mmHg) and -3.9 mmHg (95% CI -2.7 to -5.0 mmHg), respectively. Hypotensive statin effect was independent of lipid lowering. No change of BP in SF patients was observed. In ST, prostacyclin metabolites and NO concentrations were not significantly increased and autoantibodies against ox-LDL concentrations did not change. In ST, the decrease in BP correlated with increase in NO and decrease in autoantibodies against ox-LDL. Principal conclusion. High-dose atorvastatin resulted in reduction of BP independently of lipid-lowering effect, changes in endothelial function and oxidative stress, but it was related to the increase in NO and decrease in autoantibodies against ox-LDL. However, because of the open design of the study, these results should be carefully debated.

DE Bimodal critical dimension (CD) distribution; double patterning;

AB Double patterning lithography (DPL) is in current production for memory products, and is widely viewed as inevitable for logic products at the 32 nm node. DPL decomposes and prints the shapes of a critical-layer layout in two exposures. In traditional single-exposure lithography, adjacent identical layout features will have identical mean critical dimension (CD), and spatially correlated CD variations. However, with DPL, adjacent features can have distinct mean CDs, and uncorrelated CD variations. This introduces a new set of "bimodal" challenges for timing analysis and optimization. We assess the potential impact of bimodal CD distribution on timing analysis and guardbanding, and find that the traditional "unimodal" characterization and analysis framework may not be viable for DPL. We propose new bimodal-aware timing analysis and optimization methods to improve timing yield of standard-cell based designs that are manufactured using DPL. Our first contribution is a DPL-aware approach to timing modeling, based on detailed analysis of cell layouts. Our second contribution is an integer linear programming-based maximization of "alternate" mask coloring of instances in timing-critical paths, to minimize harmful covariance and performance variation. Third, we propose a dynamic programming-based detailed placement algorithm that solves mask coloring conflicts and can be used to ensure "double patterning correctness" after placement or even after detailed routing, while minimizing the displacement of timing-critical cells with manageable engineering change order (ECO) impact. With a 45 nm library and open-source design testcases, our timing-aware recoloring and placement optimization together achieve up to 271 ps (respectively, 55.75 ns) reduction in worst (respectively, total) negative slack, and 70% (respectively, 72%) reduction in worst (respectively, total) negative slack variation, respectively.

AB Objective: Long-acting injectible antipsychotic agents are rarely considered in the treatment of bipolar patients [bipolar disorder (BPD)]. We posited that BPD patients receiving risperidone long-acting injections [Risperidone long-acting injections (RLAIs)] would experience fewer negative clinical events than those receiving oral atypical antipsychotic agents (AAP).
   Methods: Adult BPD patients in a hypomanic, manic or mixed episode were randomised to either oral risperdone followed by RLAI (n = 23) or an AAP (n = 25) for 15 months. Any mood stabilizers were continued. An independent clinician board declared any clinical events that occurred but the treatment assignment was concealed.
   Results: Nine of the 48 patients who participated in this study did not improve, leaving 39 patients in 1-year extension. RLAI patients received the following bi-weekly dosages: 25 mg (n = 9), 37.5 mg (n = 8), and 50 mg (n = 6). The AAP group included aripiprazole (n = 11, 15-30 mg/day), quetiapine (n = 8, 300-700 mg/day), olanzapine (n = 5, 15-25 mg/day), and ziprasidone, (n = 1, 160 mg/day). In total, 47 clinical events were declared. The RLAI-treated group experienced significantly fewer clinical events (mean: 0.86 +/- 0.73) compared with the AAP group (1.61 +/- 1.29), t = 2.29, d.f. = 37, p = 0.028 (95% CI = 0.087-1.421). Of all, 50% of the AAP subjects gained >= 7% of their baseline body weight as did 38% of the RLAI-treated patients.
   Conclusions: RLAI-treated patients experienced significantly fewer negative clinical events. Further exploration should focus on which subtypes of BPD patients might benefit from RLAI treatment. Weight gain in BPD subjects requires clinical attention. Limitations include an open design, small sample size and the inability to conclude on whether this strategy is useful for depressive episodes.

DT Article
DE bimodal resonator; isolation; rapid scan
AB A crossed-loop (orthogonal mode) resonator (CLR) was constructed of fine wire to achieve design goals for rapid scan in vivo EPR imaging at VHF frequencies (in practice, near 250 MHz). This application requires the resonator to have a very open design to facilitate access to the animal for physiological support during the image acquisition. The rapid scan experiment uses large amplitude magnetic field scans, and sufficiently large resonator and detection bandwidths to record the rapidly-changing signal response. Rapid-scan EPR is sensitive to RF/microwave source noise and to baseline changes that are coherent with the field scan. The sensitivity to source noise is a primary incentive for using a CLR to isolate the detected signal from the RF source noise. Isolation from source noise of 44 and 47 dB was achieved in two resonator designs. Prior results showed that eddy currents contribute to background problems in rapid scan EPR, so the CLR design had to minimize conducting metal components. Using fine (AWG 38) wire for the resonators decreased eddy currents and lowered the resonator 0, thus providing larger resonator bandwidth. Mechanical resonances at specific scan frequencies are a major contributor to rapid scan backgrounds. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Robustly Adaptive Moving Thermal Object Segmentation Using Background
   Modeling Based on Runtime-Weighted Features
SO JOURNAL OF IMAGING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

ID SURVEILLANCE; TRACKING; PEOPLE
AB Moving object segmentation plays an important role in a complex object tracking system. This system decides whether the current block belongs to the object region or not. In this article, a scheme using background modeling based on runtime-weighted features for robustly adaptive moving object segmentation in infrared (IR) image sequence is proposed. Proposed background modeling for an open hardware (H/W) architecture design decreases the size of the search area to construct a sparse block template of search area in infrared images. The authors also compensate for motion compensation when the image moves in previous and current frames of IR imaging system. The method of separation of background and objects applies to adaptive values through time analysis of pixel intensity The proposed method uses more feature information such as intensity, deviation, block matching error, and velocity. The weighting values give a higher weight to feature information which has a large difference between the object and the background region. Based on experimental results, the proposed method showed real-time moving object segmentation through background modeling in the proposed embedded system.

ID MECHANISMS
AB Non-anthropomorphic wearable robots (WRs) give good grounds for expecting advantageous performances over traditional anthropomorphic solutions from both the standpoints of ergonomics and of the dynamical interaction with the human body.
   However, the kinematic design of non-anthropomorphic WRs can be too challenging for conventional synthesis methods, due to the large number of open design parameters. To support the designer, this paper presents a systematic approach, which allows to produce the whole set of independent kinematic solutions for lower limbs orthoses with given properties.
   This method has been implemented to derive the atlas of independent kinematic solutions which can be used for the kinematic design of a planar wearable robot for the lower limbs. The proposed methodology includes two tests specifically devised to solve the problem of enumeration of kinematic structures of wearable robots: the HR-isomorphism and the HR-degeneracy tests.

AB We present a lab kit platform based on an Arduino microcontroller board and open hardware that enables students to use low-cost, course specific hardware to complete lab exercises at home. The platform is designed to be accessible to a wide range of students and easily adapted for other applications. Careful hardware selection allows existing laboratory exercises to be modified for use with the platform, and the platform enables new exercises that would not be possible in a traditional lab. We describe the adoption of these kits in a course designed for on-campus and remote students that teaches the science and technology of modern display systems. We find that the platform delivers a consistent, high quality laboratory experience for both on-campus and remote students.

AB In space applications, system designs involve a particularly thorough assessment of performance, reliability and stability, as failure cost increases very significantly at each design stage. This effort has to be stressed when evaluating the feasibility of an innovative concept such as an In-Space Wireless Power Tansmission (WPT) link. In this context, this work addresses modelling/characterizing the relationships between the input design variables at subsystem level upon complete system-level performance metrics, thereby stablishing a translayer bridge between different system levels of a WPT link based on microwave RF power. The proposed design-oriented modelling framework allows to derive optimum design, which is of particular interest if a comparison of different alternative WPT methods is to be eventually addressed. The microwave WPT link is finally designed by solving the convex optimization problem of maximizing a set of target performance metrics compressed in a single merit figure, considering as the input design space the open design variables associated to the subsystem descriptions. The presented approach yields a design showing the feasibility of the WPT link with a required power of 100W from 0 to 100 meters with an efficiency range from 15% to 45%.

AB Recent reviews show large failure rates in the commercialization of new product designs Often, the reason of failure has been not a lack of technological capability of the firm, but a wrong understanding of customer preferences Extending the concept of adaptable smart products, our concept of "embedded toolkits for user co-design" proposes to design products with build-in flexibility by embedding knowledge and rules about possible product differentiations into the product This approach can be seen as a scalable attempt towards "open hardware", extending the open innovation paradigm beyond software towards tangible products Users are enabled to modify a product directly according to their individual needs. We present a technology acceptance study (TAM) of such an embedded toolkit in an automobile. Surveying 163 users demonstrates the general feasibility and value drivers of embedded toolkits Our paper contributes to the literature by discussing the contingency factors and the tactical and strategic implications of embedded open toolkits for user innovation

AB ANIMA has as a primary objective to compare three non-conventional human com-puter interfaces that comply with the industrial robot ST Robotics R-17 instructions. This mod-ule, Alpha Waves Related Potentials - ARP- explains how brain waves are obtained, processed, analyzed and identified depending on their frequency. This module makes use of the Open EEG Project's open hardware monitor for brain wave activity, called the modular EEG. The brain waves are obtained through an electrode cap complying with the international 10-20 system for electrode positioning. The brain waves are processed with a fast Fourier transform using a mi-crocontroller and analyzed in software identifying the alpha wave's contribution. A program identifies the amount of time that alpha wave generation was maintained through concentration, and instructions are sent to the robotic arm, executing one of four pre-defined routines. Thirty percent of the users attained control over the robotic arm with the human computer interface.

AB "A city can not be designed" Watanabe [1]: our ambition can be at the maximum to guide someway and in some part its growth. So as planners need tools to aid an open design with uncertain goals. This research group begin to develop such a tool at high level of abstraction (Fioravanti 2008), with the aim of investigating the potentiality of a collaboration among complementary research domains.
   The present work reports about early implementation results of an innovative approach developed by the authors, for representation of design knowledge. It has been identified in the Urban Design Ontology (Montenegro and Duarte 2009) some design entities and their internal relationships that have been formalized and visualized by means of an intuitive interface. As a matter of fact, this approach, by means of inference engines allows coherence's check and constraint verification, pointing out incompatibility between initial design program and each partial specialist design solution and/or the overall shared one.

AB Time-Scaled and Cost Optimized Fatigue Tests of Cylinder Heads on a Thermal Cylinder Head Test Stand. The thermal cylinder head test rig presents an innovative method for assessing and optimizing cylinder heads in relation to their service strength vs. thermo mechanical fatigue at a very early stage in their development process. The test rig makes it possible to reduce the testing times and costs significantly in comparison with standard engine test benches, thus shortening the development time for new cylinder head designs. The test rig's novel, open design also makes it possible to detect crack formation and investigation of crack propagation in the pent roof across therm shock cycles for the very first time. Inspection procedures do not require the assembly of the entire engine for fuelled operation.

AB The NATO Secure voice strategy identifies the Secure Communication Interoperability Protocol (SCIP) as the upcoming standard for secure voice communication within the NATO community. In support of the Secure Voice Strategy NC3A has been mandated to establish a NATO SCIP Validation Facility (NSVF) to enable conformance, interoperability and key management testing for NATO Nations. SCIP will enable multi vendor solutions for secure voice terminals, operating over heterogeneous networks, by using open standards.
   To tackle interoperability issues in secure voice communications for expeditionary operations, NC3A has developed a Secure Voice Platform using an open source voice switch. For enabling SCIP gateway functionality between circuit and packet switched networks a V.150.1 protocol stack as been added to the Secure Voice Platform. Due to its open design and flexibility the Secure Voice Platform is a very valuable resource in the conformance and interoperability tests for the integration of SCIP devices in NATO and national networks.
   This article summarizes the NATO Secure Voice Strategy and the concept of the NATO SCIP Validation Facility. Focus is on the integration of the V.150.1 protocol stack in the Secure Voice Platform. Issues arisen during the integration process are addressed as well as those discovered and solved to address interoperability aspects.

SO PAIN MEDICINE

DT Article

ID RECEPTOR; ACTIVATION; THERAPY
AB Background. Migraine is a prevalent neurological disorder. Although prevention is the core of treatment for most, some patients are refractory to standard therapies. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to evaluate the use of Quetiapine (QTP) in the preventive treatment of refractory migraine, defined as previous unresponsiveness to the combination of atenolol, nortriptyline, and flunarizine.
   Methods. Thirty-four consecutive patients (30 women and 4 men) with migraine (ICHD-II), fewer than 15 days of headache per month, and not over-using symptomatic medications were studied. All participants had failed to the combination of atenolol (60 mg/day), nortriptyline (25 mg/day), and flunarizine (3 mg/day). Failure was defined as <50% reduction in attack frequency after 10 weeks of treatment. After other medications were discontinued, QTP was initiated at a single daily dose of 25 mg, and then titrated to 75 mg. After 10 weeks, headache frequency, consumption of rescue medications, and adverse events were analyzed.
   Results. Twenty-nine patients completed the study. Three patients withdrew and two were lost to follow-up. Among those who completed, 22 (75.9%; 64.7% of the intention-to-treat population) had greater than 50% headache reduction. The mean frequency of migraine days decreased from 10.2 to 6.2 per month. Use of rescue medications decreased from 2.3 to 1.2 days/week. Adverse events were reported by nine (31%) patients.
   Conclusions. Although limited by the open design, this study provides pilot data to support the use of QTP in the preventive treatment of refractory migraine. Controlled studies are necessary to confirm these observations.

   framework
AB By open exchange of ideas and artifacts and non apriori hierarchical processes, Open Strategies enable a better usage of distributed resources, and the release of more creative potential. Applying these Open Strategies to the architectural design process, is goal of our project. The technical basis for our research is FREAC, a software framework developed in-house which provides a collaboration space for co-operation between different users and tools. This framework is designed not just for exchanging the outcome of the design process but also for opening up the design process itself and making it more transparent. Such highly open and distributed design processes, however, also present new problems and uncertainties which need to be taken into account in order to reach successful design outcomes. As a result proposals for the management of such processes need to be developed that facilitate collaborative work but do not unnecessarily constrain the inherent complexity of the design process. The actor-network theory, and other different management concepts, provides a theoretical underpinning for our approach. The project is a collaboration between the fields of computer science in architecture and media management.

DE educational robotics; Etoys; technology education; Arduino
AB In the last fifteen years, the technological education has been essentially based on digital technology, leaving aside the use of concrete material. Still having excellent simulators of the physical world, working with concrete material allows the development of cognitive structures that digital doesn't offer. Moreover, these didactic resources allow highly participative group dynamics that have not been yet reached by the existing computers at schools.
   Unfortunately, in our view there are two major difficulties for the presence of these resources in the classroom. The physical technology is expensive and suffers from constant wear. On the other hand, teachers arc not accustomed to working in a dynamic classroom with a methodology of work in a participative group, and have fears about the use of specific technological equipment. Physical Etoys is a development that aims to overcome these difficulties.
   Physical Etoys facilitates the interaction between inexperienced users and concrete material such as open hardware devices or popular toys by providing a powerful and intuitive visual programming system in order to explore and learn science in an enjoyable way. The objective of this paper is to introduce a new module of Physical Etoys which aims to persuade kids to do different electronic projects with an Arduino Board.

AB While Croatia is famous in the bridge engineering world for its concrete arch bridges, only a few steel arch bridges have been built, most of them almost fifty years ago. One of the most interesting is the true two-hinged arch bridge over the Krka River near Skradin, built in 1955 as the reconstruction of a steel truss bridge, destroyed in the World War II. The designer of the reconstruction was professor Tonkovic, who also designed the Liberty Bridge over the Sava River in Zagreb, built in 1959. Two true two-hinged steel arch bridges have been constructed on the Adriatic National road. In 1939 a railway bridge over the Sava River was built in Zagreb. At the open design competition for the design of a new bridge "Jarun" in Zagreb, a steel tied-arch bridge won the third prize.

AB As the need to innovate more creatively and effectively becomes increasingly apparent in engineering design, powerful open design tools and practices have emerged that are allowing organizations and firms to tap an already vast pool of skills, knowledge and intellect to solve complex design problems. The need for engineering design educators to bring these new trends into the classroom continues to grow as the industry for which students are being prepared begins to revamp its design strategies and practices in the pursuit of more openly accessible information infrastructures. By conducting an experimental study of over 25 student design groups in an undergraduate design engineering class, our team was able to gauge the relevance and utility of collaboration and knowledge sharing between and within design groups. Specifically, issues and opportunities were identified to help bring engineering and design education in line with the increasingly networked and distributed professional engineering environment that students will be enter upon graduation.

AB This open study exploredwhether methylphenidate could be tolerated and effective in improving the quality of life (QOL) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms of children with epilepsy and ADHD. Twenty-five subjects (aged 10.1 +/- 3.0 years) with ADHD and epilepsy were recruited at an outpatient clinic in Seoul, Korea. We used the Quality of Life in Childhood Epilepsy Questionnaire (QOLCE), ADHD rating scale (ARS) and clinical global impression (CGI) in this study. Osmotic-controlled release oral delivery system (OROS) methylphenidate, 1.0 +/- 0.4 mg/kg/day, was administered for 55.2 +/- 7.5 days. The QOL subscales including physical restriction (p = 0.005), self-esteem (p = 0.002), memory (p < 0.001), language (p = 0.005), other cognition (p < 0.001), social interaction (p = 0.002), behaviour (p < 0.001), general health (p = 0.002) and QOL (p < 0.001) were significantly increased and the ARS (p < 0.001) and CGI-Severity of illness scores (p < 0.001) were significantly reduced after medication. Although 60% of subjects had experienced adverse effects, most were tolerable and only two subjects withdrew from the study owing to unbearable adverse effects (anorexia and insomnia). Two subjects had seizure attacks during the study period without having to discontinue the trial drug. Despite limitations related to the small sample size and the open design of the present pilot study, our results suggest that OROS methylphenidate may be well tolerated and effective in reducing ADHD symptoms and improving QOL in this patient population.

LA English
DT Article
DE Renewable energy directive; Targets; Cooperation
AB In December 2008, the European Council and the European Parliament agreed on a final compromise for a new European renewable energy directive. One of the most debated issues prior to this compromise was the design of "target flexibility mechanisms", which should allow member states with low or expensive renewable energy potential to partly fulfil their national renewable energy target in other countries. This article traces back the political discussion that has led to the evolution of the different flexibility options. It then evaluates the most prominent flexibility mechanisms against a set of qualitative criteria. It concludes that free or restricted certificate trade based on guarantees of origin (GOs) - as proposed earlier by the European Commission - is not a viable option due to some "knockout" criteria, despite other potential advantages. The mechanisms that have replaced GO trade in the final compromise - joint projects, joint support schemes and statistical transfer between member states - provide less flexibility. but score better against a number of other important criteria. The crucial question for the coming years is how their utilisation can be facilitated. One first step might be that proactive member states define open design issues for implementing the mechanisms.

   on-off control systems; tracking control
AB This article introduces a computer numerical control (CNC)-based open hardware architecture system to realize the special functions of automated tape-laying (ATL) in a numerical control system. It associates a programmable multi-axis controller (PMAC) as the motion control unit with programmable numerical controllers (PCL-725, PCL-730) for on-off control. To bring about synchronized movements of the main 5-axis tape-laying head system and the 3-axis ultrasonic tape-cutting sub-system, the tracking-control method associated with time-based mode attributed to PMAC is applied in different cases. In addition, with the goal of realizing real-time tasks in the software system such as synchronizing motion control and on-off control, the real-time Win 2000 system is adopted. As a device driver for PMAC and PCL, a user graphical interface and a numerical control program interpretation module are also designed. This system is helpful to solve complicated problems in designing numerical controls for ATL such as ensuring high requirements for precise machine control and synchronization of motion control and on-off control.

AB Background: Good practice guidelines state that a psychological intervention should usually precede pharmacotherapy, but there are no data evaluating the feasibility of psychological interventions used in this way. Methods: At the first stage of a randomized blinded placebo-controlled trial, 318 patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) with clinically significant agitated behavior were treated in an open design with a psychological intervention (brief psychosocial therapy [BPST]) for 4 weeks, preceding randomization to pharmacotherapy. The therapy involved social interaction, personalized music, or removal of environmental triggers. Results: Overall, 318 patients with AD completed BPST with an improvement of 5.6 points on the total Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI; mean [SD], 63.3 [16.0] to 57.7 [18.4], t = 4.8, df = 317, p < 0.0001). Therapy worksheets were completed in six of the eight centers, with the key elements of the intervention delivered according to the manual for >95% of patients. More detailed evaluation of outcome was completed for the 198 patients with AD from these centers, who experienced a mean improvement of 6.6 points on the total CMAI (mean [SD], 62.2 [14.3] to 55.6 [15.8], t = 6.5, df - 197, p < 0.0001). Overall, 43% of participants achieved a 30% improvement in their level of agitation. Conclusion: The specific attributable benefits of BPST cannot be determined from an open trial. However, the BPST therapy was feasible and was successfully delivered according to an operationalized manual. The encouraging outcome indicates the need for a randomized controlled trial of BPST.

AB In this paper, we explore a new voice quality management model under ambience environment suitable for voice over internet protocol (VoIP) calls in wireless WLAN 802.11 Linux environment. The system is based on a setup that assimilates environment noise level using noise detector and adaptive audio manager used to tune the audio level and thereby quality is ensured. Further, existing models such as E-model, PESQ model and adaptive model address QoS in a VoIP networking perspective but do not address voice quality management in real time environment to -improve voice quality. We propose to use background noise and its associated source information in an adaptive -environment to boost user perception, audio level, thereby ensuring quality. This issue is important because in real time, consumers might be interested in mobiles that address ambience effect to determine human audible effect based on environment conditions. The experimental results of the proposed method outperform the existing method in terms of QoS factor metric; we get extensive results with more number of calls.

AB Background: In patients with acute ischaemic stroke and hyperglycaemia, prolonged strict glycaemic control may improve clinical outcome. The question is how to achieve this prolonged strict glycaemic control. In this study, the efficacy and safety of two regimens with different basal to meal related insulin ratio are described.
   Methods: 33 patients with ischaemic stroke and hyperglycaemia at admission were randomised in an open design to receive: (1) conventional glucose lowering therapy, (2) strict glucose control with predominantly basal insulin using intravenous insulin or (3) strict glucose control with predominantly meal related insulin using subcutaneous insulin in the first 5 days after stroke. The target range of glucose control for the last two groups was 4.4-6.1 mmol/l. 16 consecutive patients without hyperglycaemia at admission were included to serve as normoglycaemic controls.
   Results: The median area under the curve (AUC) in the meal related insulin group was 386 mmol/l x 58 h (range 286-662) for days 2-5, and did not differ from the hyperglycaemic control group (median AUC 444 mmol/l x 58 h; range 388-620). There was also no difference in median AUC of the basal insulin group (453 mmol/l x 58 h, range 347-629) and the hyperglycaemic control group on days 2-5. In the first 12 hours, glucose profiles were lower in the groups treated with strict glucose control; median AUC was 90 mmol/l x 12 h (range 77-189) for the hyperglycaemic control group versus 81 mmol/l x 12 h (range 60-118) for the meal related insulin group (p = 0.03) and 74 mmol/l x 12 h (range 52-97) for the basal insulin group (p = 0.008).
   Conclusion: In intermittently fed ischaemic stroke patients, strict glycaemic control between day 2 and day 5 with two different basal bolus regimens did not result in lower glucose profiles due to postprandial hyperglycaemia. Continuous enteral feeding may therefore be needed to achieve prolonged strict glycaemic control in acute stroke patients.

AB Open source software development has received considerable scholarly attention, much of which is based on the presumption that the 'open source model' holds some lessons of broader applicability. Nonetheless, our knowledge of its deployment outside the software industry is very limited. This paper focuses on the open source development of tangible objects, the so-called open design. We propose a generalised definition of open source development. Drawing on 27 exploratory interviews and six comparative case studies selected from a pool of more than 75 projects, we analyse the workings of open design. The analysis reveals that open design is already being implemented in a substantial variety of projects with different organisational and institutional structures.

AB Current diagnostic tools for the assessment of lung function are limited by global measurements or the need for radioactive tracers. Ideally, these tools should allow quantitative, regional distinct analyses without exposure to radiation. The current paper presents oxygen-enhanced functional MRI for assessment of lung ventilation. First applied in humans in 1996, a considerable amount of experience is now available on 1.5T scanners. The generation of quantitative T1-maps shows a high clinical potential. Low-field MR scanners, which are mostly open-designed, are especially interesting for functional lung imaging. The open design has advantages in respect to patient comfort by lower noise production and easy access to the patients and the costs are lower (no need for helium cooling). Lower signal-to-noise ratios can be overcome by changing the relaxation times. New navigator techniques allow further compensations. This article focuses on the presentation of low-field scanners and the application of T1 and T2(*) maps is described for healthy volunteers and first patients.

AB This paper deals with the development of an open design platform for characterization of mechanical cellular behavior. The resulting setup combines Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) techniques and advanced robotic approaches in order to carry out both prolonged observations and spatial measurements on biological samples. Visual and force feedback is controlled to achieve automatic data acquisition and to monitor process when high skills are required. The issue of the spring constant calibration is addressed using an accurate dynamic vibration approach. Experimentation on the mechanical cell characterization under in vitro conditions on human adherent Epithelial Hela cells demonstrates the viability and effectiveness of the proposed setup. Finally, the JKR (Johnson, Kendall and Roberts), the DMT (Derjaguin, Muller and Toporov) and Hertz contact theories are used to estimate the contact area between the cantilever and the biological sample.

AB How does a newly diagnosed user get inducted into a forum dedicated to people suffering from bipolar disorder? Is their opening message "matched" by the forum's reply? We add to the literature on social support online by using conversation analysis (CA) to explore an apparent contradiction between a new user's first post and forum members' replies with ostensibly unsolicited advice. CA reveals the intimate relation between turns in sequence, an aspect of online communication largely ignored in existing work on social support. Seen from this perspective, giving unsolicited advice, although apparently a "mismatch," turns out to be a consequence of the open design of the new user's initial posting. We speculate that such unsolicited advice might function at the ideological level to induct the new user into the mores of the group, not only in the kind of support it countenances giving, but into the very meaning of bipolarity itself.

AB This paper revisits the problem of the readiness for field deployments of wireless sensor networks by assessing the relevance of using Open Hardware and Software motes for environment monitoring. We propose a new prototype wireless sensor network that fine-tunes SquidBee motes to improve the life-time and sensing performance of an environment monitoring system that measures temperature, humidity and luminosity. Building upon two outdoor sensing scenarios, we evaluate the performance of the newly proposed energy-aware prototype solution in terms of link quality when expressed by the Received Signal Strength, Packet Loss and the battery lifetime. The experimental results reveal the relevance of using the Open Hardware and Software motes when setting up outdoor wireless sensor networks.

AB Vacuum solar telescopes solve the problem of image deterioration inside the telescope due to refractive index fluctuations of the air heated by the solar light. However, such telescopes have a practical diameter limit somewhat over 1 m. The Dutch Open Telescope (DOT) was the pioneering demonstrator of the open-telescope technology without need of vacuum, now pursued in the German GREGOR. Important ingredients for this technology are primary beam completely open to natural wind flow, stiff but still open design by principal stiff overall geometries in combination with carefully designed joints and completely open-foldable dome constructions based on tensioned strong cloth. Further developments to large sizes are made within the framework of the design study for a European Solar Telescope (EST).

AB This article presents the development of a metamodel and an open-source design environment for the synchronous language SIGNAL in the GME and Eclipse frameworks. This environment is intended to be used as a pivot modeling tool for a customized, aspect-oriented and application-driven, computer-aided engineering of embedded systems starting from multiple and heterogeneous initial specifications. The metamodel, called SIGNALMETA, is defined on top of the design workbench POLYCHRONY, which is dedicated to SIGNAL programming. Automated transformations are defined and implemented in order to produce, analyze, statically verify and model-check programs obtained from high-level models.
   The proposed approach promotes model-driven engineering within a framework that strongly favors formal validation. It aims at significantly decreasing design costs while improving the quality of systems. We demonstrate the agility of this approach by considering the design of both control-oriented and avionic systems. We start with an implementation of core polychronous(1) data-flow concepts in GME and show the ease of its modular extension with application-specific concepts such as mode automata or integrated modular avionics concepts. This work is the first attempt to generalize the formal model of computation and the design philosophy of POLYCHRONY. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB T he administration of prophylactic antibiotics before pacemaker or internal cardioverter-defibrillator implantation has been implemented widely and routinely. The acceptance of this practice has occurred despite the absence of rigorous examination or definitive evidence. The existing data for the use of prophylactic antibiotic therapy in device implantation consist of 7 randomized, controlled trials, with all but I having an open design.(1) Early trials yielded contradictory results, citing small study numbers, a low incidence of infection, and inconsistent definitions of infection as possible explanations.(2-4) Four of the 7 trials found antibiotic prophylaxis effective in preventing infection; the lone double-blind, randomized, controlled study consisted of 106 patients and failed to demonstrate a difference in infection rate with antibiotic prophylaxis because there were no documented infections at 7 to 35 months of follow-up.(3) In addition to their inconsistent results, widely varying antibiotic regimens were implemented in these trials, further confounding the ability of operators to interpret the available data and to implement evidence-based medicine into practice. Despite the equivocal findings of these individual studies, a meta-analysis of antibiotic prophylaxis for permanent pacemaker implantation by Da Costa et all in 1998 demonstrated a significant reduction in the incidence of infection. The study in this issue of Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology by de Oliveira et al(5) is the first large-scale, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial establishing the benefit of antibiotic prophylaxis in prevention of device implant infections.

DE QoS in VoIP; voice quality management; wireless mobile multimedia; SIP;

AB This In this work, we propose a model for measuring and improving voice quality under ambience environment for VoIP calls in wireless WLAN 802.11. Existing models such as E-model, PESQ model and Adaptive model which address QoS in VoIP networking do not address voice quality management in real time environment to improve voice quality. The idea is to use background noise and its associated source information in an adaptive environment to boost user perceivance audio level thereby quality is assured. This issue is important because in real time, consumers might be interested with mobiles that address ambience effect to determine human audible effect based on environment conditions. The set-up include environment noise detector to assimilate environment noise level and adaptive audio factor manager to tune audio level accordingly. Then QoS factor is determined for this set-up. Further, according to our model, when dB level increases, audio level at receiver side is tuned adaptively at that point of time by decision manager thereby providing better QoI metric under ambience environment.

AB Future network infrastructure systems demand an extensible, continuous design fiamework to readily incorporate emerging technologies. Other domains have addressed this demand by moving towards an open design and development approach to capture the ingenuity of a community of developers. Yet, the design and development of current network infrastructure systems remains predominately closed. In this paper, we detail the trends in the deossification of network infrastructure, explore the challenges of an open design and development approach and suggest a framework to address these trends and challenges. The main contribution of this work is a tool-supported, open architectural design and analysis approach with a comprehensive dependability analysis tool for the design of dependable, fault-resilient systems capable of ensuring the high assurance properties required in network infrastructure systems.

AB The NetFPGA platform is designed to enable students and researchers to build networking systems that run at line-rate, and to create re-usable designs to share with others. Our goal is to eventually create a thriving developer-community, where developers around the world contribute reusable modules and designs for the benefit of the community as a whole. To this end, we have created a repository of "User Contributed Designs" at NetFPGA.org. But creating an "open-source hardware" platform is quite different from software oriented open-source projects. Designing hardware is much more time consuming and more error prone than designing software, and so demands a process that is more focussed on verifying that a module really works as advertised, else others will be reluctant to use it. We have designed a novel process for contributing new designs. Each contributed design is specified entirely by a set of tests it passes. A developer includes a list of tests that their design will pass, along with an executable set of tests that the user can check against. Through this process, we hope to establish the right expectations for someone who reuses a design, and to encourage sound design practices with solid, repeatable and integrated testing. In this paper we describe the philosophy behind our process, in the hope that others may learn from it, as well as describe the details of how someone contributes a new design to the NetFPGA repository.

AB This work presents an on-going project that consists in providing low-cost telephony services in remote areas in the Amazon region, North Brazil. The idea is to build GSM networks using open-source and open-hardware projects, such as: OpenBTS, Openmoko, IP04, Asterisk and USRP. The NavegaPara Program, which currently connects thirteen cities in the state, provides the backbone network with optical fiber and digital radios. This paper summarizes the project and discusses the strategy adopted to circumvent a specific problem: the establishment of know-how on GSM technologies among engineering (electrical and computer) students. Several hands-on experiments in GSM technologies are being currently used and some are described here. For example, the work discusses how the Matlab toolkit GSMsim can be used to analyze digitized GSM waveforms. It also describes the development of a QAM modulator for better understanding the basics of GNU Radio. The success of the project will be measured by the effect in the life of citizens who, currently, do not have any access to a phone for basic communication needs.

DE Computer software; Program testing; Computer applications
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe a case study of the development, features and evaluation of a rich internet application for libraries. It aims to demonstrate best practice in the use of software standards, development processes and evaluation.
   Design/methodology/approach - Web 2.0, open source design methods and usability testing were used within an agile framework.
   Findings - The adoption of agile software development methods, coupled with usability testing, would enable the library community to take full advantage of the techniques and principles inherent in Web 2.0 open source software.
   Research limitations/implications - A major component of the evaluation of QJAX was a series of usability tests. As is the nature of most usability studies, the results are not generalisable.
   Originality/value - Aspects of agile software development methods, such as usability testing and iterative design, are recognised in the literature as contributing to the usability of library software. However, exploration of the use of a full agile framework plus usability testing to facilitate Web 2.0 open source software is rare in library-related literature.

AB There has been a recent emergence of communities working together in large numbers to develop new products, services, and systems. Collaboration at such scales, referred to as mass collaboration, has resulted in various robust products including Linux and Wikipedia. Companies are also beginning to utilize the power of mass collaboration to foster innovation at various levels. Business models based on mass collaboration are also emerging. Such an environment of mass collaboration brings about significant opportunities and challenges for designing next generation products.
   The objectives in this paper are to discuss these recent developments in the context of engineering design and to identify new research challenges. The recent trends in mass collaboration are discussed and the impacts of these trends on product realization processes are presented. Traditional collaborative product realization is distinguished from mass collaborative product realization. Finally, the open research issues for successful implementation of mass collaborative product realization are discussed.

The unique features of blender are examined in terms of ease of use and integrated nature since blender incorporates a simulation engine and a game engine that can be used creatively in the design process. The unique data structure of Blender is examined with the features and work flow that this structure brings in the design process. Also a simple comparison is made between Blender and 3ds max in terms of features and workflow as visualization tools together with an assessment of a two year seminar that took place in the Department of Architecture, in Volos Greece.

AB Challenges in sustainability represent complex problems with multi-dimensional, interlaced issues. Design education has responded to the need to address such issues by incorporating sustainability based courses. The more complex an issue, the more trans-disciplinary the role of design has to be so as to adequately address the overlap of the forces at play. This paper describes two experiments in education in order to observe how students navigate from concrete to abstract, from reality to imagination, from closed to open issues. Experiments have been carried out on two briefs (systems for energy conservation, sustainable bottle of water) with masters-level students from multiple backgrounds in two joint programs at two different locations. The selection of briefs, processes, and results are described, indicating the level of success of the pedagogical techniques. Contrary to teaching traditional design skills for tangible issues, these courses are responses to the need to develop tools and methodologies for developing heuristics and classroom techniques for design education to incorporate sustainability as a core value in curricula.

AB In today's society, collaboration between individuals and groups thousands of miles away has become increasingly common place. Due primarily to the rapid growth of broadband internet, cheap data storage and fast microchip technology, a new frontier has been opened where engineers and scientists can quickly and efficiently share large amounts of information with colleagues all across the globe. The implications of this technology have been and continue to become increasingly influential on the evolution of not just the sciences, but humanity as a whole. This paper will survey current successes that have been seen in open source software development and the emergent 'open design' realm. From here, parallels are drawn between the two disciplines to illustrate how engineering organizations can benefit from the highly distributed nature that open source software has implemented. In this light, this paper will establish the position that engineering design must make the shift towards a more open and collaborative environment to stay relevant and prosper in the Information Age. Additionally, a basic web framework detailing the technologies needed to see such a shift occur will be outlined. Currently, there is some research being done in this area, but overall the possibilities for growth and innovation are significant.

AB This paper presents the development and test of the standard IEC-60870-5 application layer protocol for a Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) based on open hardware and software. The RTU hardware is an embedded system, a SoC-type design using FPGA that has been programmed with the open core LEON with Linux operating system running over it, so both the hardware and IOS are open source. For prototyping the GR-XC3S-1500 board has been used. There is no open source code available for the IEC standard protocols, so application layer protocol has to be implemented. All the software design has been made in a PC platform using standard development tools. The source code generated for the protocol has been compiled with the standard Linux gcc compiler in LEON. Several tests have been made to prove the right behavior of the protocol as well as its performance over different transmission mediums.

AB Open source appropriate technology (OSAT) refers to technologies that provide for sustainable development while being designed in the same fashion as free and open-source software. Facilitated by advances in information technology software and hardware, new ways to disseminate information such as wikis and Internet-enabled mobile phones, the global development of OSAT has emerged as a reality. This paper shows the sharing of design processes, appropriate tools, and technical information is enables more effective and rapid development of appropriate technologies for both industrialized and non-industrialized regions. This sharing will require the appropriate technology community to adopt open standards/licenses, document knowledge, and build on previous work. This paper offers solutions in the form of both business models and tools to overcome technical constraints of OSAT development in the forms of the platforms necessary on which to share and build knowledge about appropriate technologies. These solutions are open, easily accessible for those in need, have a low barrier to entry for both users and information creators, and must be vetted in order to utilized as a trustworthy source on critical information needs. Current progress towards implementing these solutions will be reviewed and recommendations will be made to further increase the rate of OSAT development.

At the first stage, the structural problem can be decoupled from electromagnetic phenomena as well as from the local projectile behavior. The magnetic pressure repelling the rails from each other and expanding with the speed of the projectile serves as a boundary condition for purely mechanical calculations. The particularity of the investigation is represented by the type of railgun housing. For some years, the ISL has been using laboratory housings of an open,design allowing, for instance, to take flash radiographs during launch. The repelling forces are mainly taken by discrete supports in the form of steel bolts. These bolts are connected to bars made of glassfiber-reinforced plastics, while the rails are mounted on these bars. A 2-D finite-element model of a complex housing was developed in this paper. Bars, including rails, are described by plane-stress elements, while bolts, playing the role of discrete elastic supports, are presented by truss elements. The model is implemented using the ANSYS code. Deformation properties of the rail section and elastic supports are examined by considering a static solution, assuming constant loading. Differences between 2-D and conventional beam models being of importance for this kind of problem are briefly discussed. Transient analysis was performed for a set of constant loading velocities (600-1600 m/s) and for the experimentally derived transient-loading profile. The latter was obtained in the railgun experiments performed using the ISL-railgun EMA3 with a caliber of 15 x 30 mm(2) and typical muzzle velocities up to 1600 m/s as well as peak currents of about 600 kA.

AB This paper presents the development and test of the standard IEC-60870-5 application layer protocol over TCP/IP for a Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) based on open hardware and software. The RTU hardware is an embedded system, a SoC-type design using FPGA that has been programmed with the open core LEON with Linux operating system running over it, so both the hardware and IOS are open source. For prototyping the GR-XC3S-1500 board has been used. There is no open source code available for the IEC standard protocols, so application layer protocol over TCP/IP has to be implemented. All the software design has been made in a PC platform using standard development tools. The source code generated for the protocol has been compiled with the standard Linux gee compiler in LEON. Several tests have been made to prove that the RTU works correctly.

AB The author conducted a 3-week qualitative case study at the School of Environmental Studies (SES), a senior public school with an environmental studies focus. He argues that SES's physical design facilitates collaborative, multidisciplinary teaching practices especially suited to the school's environmental studies curriculum. He also shows that the school's open plan architecture positively contributes to the social climate at SES. Students who were interviewed as part of the study expressed a preference for the open plan setting over conventional classrooms because the open design helps them socially connect with a larger number of peers than would be possible in a more enclosed environment. Students consequently felt more socially accepted at SES and better enjoyed their time in school in comparison with other high schools they had attended.

AB This paper describes the High Bandwidth High Throughput (HBHT) Government Reference Architecture (GRA) effort and utilization of Dependency Structure Matrix (DSM) tools to validate the architecture. This paper is intended to show how the development of GRA compliant modules advances both new and time-tested technologies through establishing a standard for Above 2 GHz SATCOM Terminal modules. The paper will also describe plans to develop and apply tools, products and solutions to validate the GRA.
   The paper describes the process associated with engaging industry in developing the GRA. Functional Decomposition, validating the GRA through a prototype, creating the GRA as a standard for the Army HC3 Program, and managing to that architecture and standard in a development environment. The paper also describes how GRA validation through use of DSM tools, such as LATTIX, will aid in the development and testing of a GRA Hardware and Software Interface Test Development Environment designed to allow a GRA module developer to develop, interface, and test interface applications to the GRA compatible open hardware/software interfaces. Full documentation shall be developed for all open hardware and software interfaces, sufficient to develop applications with minimum interface or interaction with the module developer. Interface definition stability over time will be a key factor in the mission success of the HC3 open system interfaces, so they must be designed with stability and longevity in mind.
   This paper will review alternatives for validation of GRA compliant modules. Particular emphasis will be placed on DSM techniques. The interdependencies between modules will be modeled using a DSM so as to provide a big picture view of GRA. DSM can also be used to model and expose key design decisions for the entire team. Rules can be established in the DSM model for GRA compliance to guide a GRA module developer during development and testing for validation. The use of DSM to model various hardware and software modules in the HBHT will create a common artifact that can be shared across various teams with different skills and domains of expertise. DSM can also be used to analyze the impact of change. Over time, DSM will provide a blue print of the architecture and how it evolves to meet changing needs.

AB Pattern matching is the critical part in Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). Fast pattern matching algorithm is the key to improve the system performance. In this paper, a fast reverse pattern matching algorithm and the hardware implementation suitable with Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) are proposed. Taking advantage of the parallelism and programmability of FPGA, this design reduces the pattern match delay greatly. This design is implemented in a NetFPGA platform, which is an open hardware platform optimized for high-speed network. The parallel pattern matching system provides a high throughput of 4 Gbps with no data loss, which proves the information processing rate of this design.

AB The concept of Wearable Computing can be used to support work processes of mobile workers e.g. in a factory environment or outdoors. The basis is a wireless network for in ubiquituous remote access to information. In the paper we explain the potential of Wearable Computing and focus on the technological challenges. During the last five years (2004 till 2009) the EC funded the worldwide largest project on Wearable Computing: wearIT@work (www.wearitatwork.com)(1). The project did not focus on new technologies. However, with existing technologies new applications were developed. For new user groups of mobile workers a new quality of support had to be achieved. The paper reports at the end of the project on the main findings and lessons learned: An open hardware platform, an open software framework and for seven different application domains solutions were developed.

AB Low-field office magnetic resonance scanners have been an exciting, innovative, and controversial development in medical imaging. These units boost cost efficiency, with ease of installation and no additional external radiofrequency shielding necessary. The open design enables imaging of those who are claustrophobic and overweight, and offer the potential of dynamic imaging for athletes. Experienced centers have reported that the diagnostic accuracy obtained with office-based systems is satisfactory and comparable with that of high-field systems. However. with the advantages afforded by these convenient units, some significant limitations owing primarily to decreased signal-to-noise ratio of low-field MR imaging and lower image quality compared with conventional high-field magnetic resonance scanners. In this article, we comprehensively reviewed the literature focusing on the diagnostic accuracy of low-field imaging with respect to individual joints and the major pathology that occur in these joints. According to most studies, there the still a number of patients in whom clinical treatment is affected owing to under or misdiagnosis by low-field MR imaging. For clinicians and radiologist, who are an integral part of this office-based diagnostic system, it is important to be knowledgeable of the potential limitations of these low-field scanners compared with conventional systems. Specialized training and expertize is required to optimize imaging parameters, and provide quality control and accurate interpretation.

   exercise capacity
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY NEUROSURGERY AND PSYCHIATRY

DT Article
ID FUEL UTILIZATION; GUIDELINES; TOLERANCE; INSIGHTS
AB Background: Two single case studies suggest that a protein-rich diet may be beneficial for patients with McArdle disease, based on improvements in either endurance or muscle energetics, as assessed by phosphorous MR spectroscopy. In healthy subjects, proteins contribute very little to energy metabolism during exercise, which questions the effect of protein in McArdle disease.
   Methods: In a crossover, open design, we studied seven patients with McArdle disease, who were randomised to follow either a carbohydrate- or protein-rich diet for 3 days before testing. Calorific intake on each diet was identical, and was adjusted to the subject's weight, age and sex. After each diet, exercise tolerance and maximal work capacity were tested on a bicycle ergometer, using a constant workload for 15 minutes followed by an incremental workload to exhaustion.
   Results: During the constant workload, heart rate and perceived exertion were consistently lower (p<0.0005) on the carbohydrate- versus protein-rich diet. Patients also had a 25% improvement in maximal oxidative work capacity on the carbohydrate versus the protein diet.
   Conclusions: This study shows that patients with McArdle disease can improve their maximal work capacity and exercise tolerance to submaximal workloads by maintaining a diet high in carbohydrate instead of protein. The carbohydrate diet not only improves tolerance to everyday activities, but will probably also help to prevent exercise-induced episodes of muscle injury in McArdle disease.

AB Simultaneous recording of electrophysiology and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a technique of growing importance in neuroscience. Rapidly evolving clinical and scientific requirements have created a need for hardware and software that can be customized for specific applications. Hardware may require customization to enable a variety of recording types (e.g., electroencephalogram, local field potentials, or multi-unit activity) while meeting the stringent and costly requirements of MRI safety and compatibility. Real-time signal processing tools are an enabling technology for studies of learning, attention, sleep, epilepsy, neurofeedback, and neuropharmacology, yet real-time signal processing tools are difficult to develop. We describe an open-source system for simultaneous electrophysiology and fMRI featuring low-noise (< 0.6 mu V p-p input noise), electromagnetic compatibility for MRI (tested up to 7T), and user-programmable real-time signal processing. The hardware distribution provides the complete specifications required to build an MRI-compatible electrophysiological data acquisition system, including circuit schematics, print circuit board (PCB) layouts, Gerber files for PCB fabrication and robotic assembly, a bill of materials with part numbers, data sheets, and vendor information, and test procedures. The software facilitates rapid implementation of real-time signal processing algorithms. This system has been used in human EEG/fMRI studies at 3 and 7T examining the auditory system, visual system, sleep physiology, and anesthesia, as well as in intracranial electrophysiological studies of the non-human primate visual system during 3T fMRI, and in human hyperbaric physiology studies at depths of up to 300 feet below sea level.

TI A Survey of Mobility Management in Hybrid Wireless Mesh Networks

DT Article
AB Mobility management is vital for realizing large-scale wireless mesh networks to provide cost-effective broadband Internet access. Although a considerable amount of research on mobility management for cellular, Mobile IP, and mobile ad hoc networks has been proposed, mobility management for IP-based hybrid WMNs, including the mobility support from both the network and link layers, remains largely unexplored. Traditional mobility management mechanisms, when applied to hybrid WMNs, may cause significant performance degradation because of the overlooking of key features of WMNs. Challenges arising from multihop wireless communications require the design of new mobility management techniques in WMNs. In this article, mobility management in IP-based hybrid WMNs is investigated. The motivation for mobility management in WMNs is explained, and the existing work is surveyed. To address the new challenges, various open design issues also are presented.

The system relies on infrared communications with frequency modulation and is composed of two interconnected modules for data and power measurement. Thanks to the open hardware license under which it is released, the research community can easily replicate the system at a low cost and/or adapt it for applications in sensor networks and in robotics.

ID CHEMICAL DISINFECTION; HEAT; AGENTS
AB The aim of this study was to investigate the advantages and disadvantages of different commercially available biomonitors for the validation of chemo-thermal disinfecting washing procedures in textile service enterprises. in the course of quality management systems (e.g. acc. to EN 14065: Risk Analysis and Bio-contamination Control System, RABC-System) the performance of disinfecting washing procedures has to be controlled and validated periodically by the use of biomonitors. Biomonitors (typically small cotton fabrics) are loaded with bacteria and often encapsulated in semipermeable membranes. The following types of biomonitors are commercially available: a) "open design", fabrics soaked with blood and bacteria enclosed in textile bags, b) monitors with bacteria enclosed in a semipermeable membrane and c) monitors surrounded by a semipermeable membrane and covered with a hard plastic surface. The membranes should avoid bacterial contamination of the textiles and environment because bacteria are too large to pass the membrane. It is commonly accepted in practice that liquids, proteins and disinfecting agents can diffuse through the membrane. However, big differences in the germ reductions measured with different biomonitors were detected, depending on their individual design. Therefore the diffusion properties of several detergent ingredients were quantified by using semipermeable membranes. it is demonstrated that proteins and even active oxygen species, are retained by these membranes and are thus not able to kill or inactivate bacteria inside the monitors. Hence the use of biomonitors with membranes should be reconsidered, because they are mainly able to detect thermal disinfection, but barely react to the chemical part of chemo-thermal disinfection procedures.

AB Methods to determine cytokine protein content in samples of interest, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), are often labor-intensive and costly. Furthermore, because ELISA requires relatively large sample volumes and protein concentrations, it is difficult using this technique to determine protein content for multiple cytokines from individual samples. Recently, Luminex has developed an open source hardware platform combining flow cytometry- and bead-based antibody capture that is capable of detecting multiple analytes from a single sample. In the present study we employed the Luminex 2000 platform to determine the cytokine protein content in discrete brain regions of C57BL/6J mice. In spike-and-recovery experiments, known concentrations of murine recombinant interleukin (IL)-1, 1 beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha were added either singly or as a mixture of all three to whole brain homogenates containing known quantities of total protein. Spiked samples were assayed for either a single cytokine or for multiple cytokines using 1-plex or 3-plex assay kits, respectively. In whole mouse brain homogenate we recovered between 81% and 103% of the recombinant cytokines. We then injected C57BL/6J mice intraperitoneally with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and sacrificed them 4 h later. We detected in samples taken from LPS-stimulated mice 4- to 870-fold increases in serum or spleen cytokine protein, and 1.5- to 16-fold increases in cytokine protein in discrete brain regions, relative to protein content in samples obtained from vehicle-treated animals. These results indicate that multiple cytokines may be reliably assayed from discrete regions of mouse brain using a single sample. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Due to the complexity of multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) wireless channels, direct measurement is the main viable option for accurate characterization. Details on a new low-cost wideband channel sounder are presented, which was mainly constructed from conventional instruments and components. This switched architecture system is similar to commercial channel sounders and has modest cost (< US$ 50000). The sounder operates in the 2- to 8-GHz range with up to 100 MHz of instantaneous bandwidth and supports eight transmitters and receivers, which are sufficient to support the development and assessment of current and future MIMO wireless systems. In this "open-hardware" project, the hardware design and software components are openly available to other researchers interested in developing or enhancing the MIMO measurement capability. The actual systems built at the University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa, and Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, are presented, as are some example studies.

AB The bipolar plate/current collector plays an important role in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC). A current collector with different geometries could have a significant influence on cell performance. This paper presents fractal geometry application to Current collector design in a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC). This new current collector design is named CCFG (Current Collectors with Fractal Geometry). This research determined how to make a better free open design for the current collector on a printed circuit board based DMFC. The results show that both the free area ratio and total holes perimeter length on the bipolar plate affect the cell performance. The total number of holes on the perimeter presents greater effects than the free open ratio. The cell performance is more sensitive using a cathode current collector than the anode current collector. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Migraine is a prevalent neurological disorder. Although prevention is the mainstream treatment, some patients are refractory to standard therapies. Aim: To evaluate the use of quetiapine (QTP) in the preventive treatment of refractory migraine, defined as previous unresponsiveness to the combination atenolol + nortriptyline + flunarizine. Method: Thirty-four consecutive patients ( 30 women and 4 men) with migraine (ICHD-II) and headache attacks on less than 15 days per month not overusing symptomatic medications were studied. The main inclusion criterion was the lack of response (< 50% reduction in attack frequency) after ten weeks to the combination of atenolol ( 60 mg/day) + nortriptyline (25 mg/day) + flunarizine (3 mg/day). The patients started on QTP as the sole treatment in a single daily dose of 25 mg, titrated to 75 mg. After ten weeks, headache frequency, consumption of rescue medications and adverse events were analyzed. Results: Twenty nine patients completed the study. Among completers, 22 (75.9%; 64.7% of the intention-to-treat population) presented > 50% headache reduction. The mean frequency of migraine days decreased from 10.2 to 6.2 and the average consumption of rescue medications decreased from 2.3 to 1.2 days/week. Adverse events were reported by 9 (31%) patients. Conclusion: Although limited by the open design, this study provides a pilot data to support the use of quetiapine in preventive treatment of refractory migraine.

It is especially difficult to change ECU suppliers or reuse the software in a new generation of products. Increasing functional requirements in automotive E/E vehicle development will significantly enhance the integration of novel functions. In order to satisfy the increasing requirements for the complex software development of automotive E/E system, implement the portability of application software modules and compatibility of ECU modules among different automotive OEMs and their suppliers, this paper presents an open design rnethodology based on quantum platform.

AB Introduction: Pregabalin is a new anxiolytic that selectively binds to the alpha2-delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, inhibiting release of excessive levels of excitatory neurotransmitters. In this open-label trial we aimed to investigate the efficacy of pregabalin on alcoholism indices in detoxified alcohol-dependent subjects. Reduction of cravings, psychiatric symptom improvements, and the evaluation of safety parameters were the secondary endpoints.
   Methods: Thirty-one alcohol-dependent patients were consecutively recruited and screened for the study. Twenty detoxified patients received pregabalin starting at 50 mg/day (orally) in the first week, gradually increasing to a flexible dose of 150-450 mg/day. Subjects were assessed at the beginning of the treatment, and after 2, 8 and 16 weeks. Craving (visual analogue scale, Obsessive and Compulsive Drinking Scale [OCDS]) and withdrawal (Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol [CIWA-Ar]) rating scales were applied; psychiatric symptoms were evaluated through the Symptom Check List-90-Revised (SCL-90-R).
   Results: Out of the twenty patients who received the study drug, 15 completed the study procedures: 10 remained totally alcohol-free for the duration of the study, five relapsed. An additional four patients dropped out during the study, and one stopped taking medication due to adverse events. A significant progressive reduction of both craving and withdrawal symptomatology were observed. Safety parameters did not show any significant variation during treatment.
   Conclusion: Pregabalin shows promise as a treatment for alcohol dependence. Although limited by a low number of participants and by the open design, this is the first study concerning the efficacy and safety of pregabalin in current alcoholics. In these patients pregabalin was effective and well tolerated. Additional research is needed to explore the clinical relevance of these findings.

AB Purpose: To assess the image quality of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) of the carotid artery with open 0.35-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), compared to a 1.5-T high-field system.
   Patients and Methods: 100 patients were retrospectively evaluated with CE-MRA for suspected carotid or vertebral artery disease. 50 patients were investigated using an open-design 0.35-T MRI system, 50 were examined on a 1.5-T closed-bore magnet system. Maximum intensity (MIP) and volume-rendering technique (VRT) reconstructions were performed. Image quality was assessed using a four-point ranking score (1 = excellent, 4 = not evaluable). Signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio was measured. The data were analyzed using Wilcoxon's test (score data) and Student's t-test (S/N ratio). Significance levels were set at p < 0.05.
   Results: For 1.5-T imaging, average image quality using VRT for the common carotid artery (CCA), internal carotid artery (ICA), external carotid artery (ECA), and vertebral arteries (VAs) was 1.68, 1.14, 1.21, and 1.54, respectively. For MIP imaging, average image quality for the CCA, ICA, ECA, and VA was 1.44, 1.16, 1.22, and 1.22, respectively. For 0.35-T imaging, average image quality using VRT for the CCA, ICA, ECA, and VA was 1.46, 1.44, 1.90, and 2.02, respectively. For MIP imaging, average image quality for the CCA, ICA, ECA, and VA was 1.76, 1.80, 2.31, and 2.18, respectively. Quality differed significantly between 1.5 and 0.35 T, except for the CCA. There was no significant quality difference for the CCA between 0.35 T and 1.5 T using MIP or VRT reconstruction. There was no significant difference for the S/N ratio (p > 0.05).
   Conclusion: The 1.5-T system showed significantly or highly significantly better image quality scores, compared to the 0.35-T system. Nevertheless, image quality was rated satisfactory also using 0.35 T field strength.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of amantadine therapy for early arousal and improved cognition in traumatic brain injury (TBI).
   DATA SOURCES: Literature was accessed through MEDLINE (1950-August 2007) using the MeSH terms amantadine, brain injuries, cognition, and arousal. PubMed (through August 2007) terms included amantadine, traumatic brain injury, and cerebral injury.
   STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All studies of amantadine (used <6 mo after injury) for enhancement of arousal or cognition in patients with TBI were reviewed.
   DATA SYNTHESIS: Many cases of TBI are associated with frontal lobe injury As a dopamine agonist, amantadine is thought to be involved in frontal lobe stimulation. Two case reports, 3 retrospective studies, and 2 randomized, doubles blind, controlled trials of amantadine therapy for early arousal in TBI were identified and reviewed. Limitations of the available studies include open design, retrospective design, and heterogeneous brain injury types. Results have been inconsistent between studies, largely due to variability in designs, heterogeneity in patient populations, time following injury, and use of numerous different outcome measures. Despite these limitations, improvements in arousal and cognition, as documented by the Glasgow Coma Scale and other measures, have been observed in patients with TBI when amantadine has been initiated 3 days to 5 months after injury.
   CONCLUSIONS: At doses of 200-400 mg/day, amantadine appears to safely improve arousal and cognition in patients with TBI. Additional prospective controlled studies with homogeneous patient populations will better define the role of amantadine for early arousal.

AB This is a proposal to demonstrate an innovation in wireless infrastructure. The project consists of augmenting standard 802.11b wireless technology with fast radiolocation, and the work is currently in progress at Indiana University. We will show the functioning of a recently built prototype, and illustrate its architecture with a poster. We will demonstrate real-time determination of the direction of arrival of wireless packets, using this lab prototype, which consists of an antenna array and radiolocation electronics, combined with an open-design 802.11b device.
   The envisioned use of this technology is to make it a standard, ubiquitous part of wireless infrastructure. It will enhance the diagnostics and security management of wireless networks, provide better connectivity, and make more rational use of radio resources. These factors make this technology interesting to wi-fi developers and manufacturers, and to institutions that wish to improve their wireless network management.

It uses historical analyses of the broadcasting industry to define these vertically disintegrated layers and the emergence of open design rules that enable vertically disintegrated firms to enter the sector. It uses data on the number of firms and revenues in each layer to show how the emergence of independent modules and vertical disintegration has led to the emergence of entrepreneurial opportunities even when other scholars define these modular designs as dominant designs, which is contrary to existing theories used in the entrepreneurial literature.

AB An analog VLSI hardware architecture for the distributed simulation of large-scale spiking neural networks has been developed. Several hundred integrated computing nodes, each hosting up to 512 neurons, will he interconnected and operated on un-cut silicon wafers. The electro-technical aspects and the details of the hardware implementation are covered in a separate contribution to this conference. This paper focuses on the usability of the system by demonstrating that biologically relevant network models can in fact be mapped to this system. Different network configurations am established on the hardware by programmable switch matrices, repeaters, and address decoders. Systematic routing algorithms are presented to map a given network model to the hardware system. Routing is simulated for several network examples, proving the system's practical applicability. Furthermore, the routing simulations are used to fix values for yet open hardware parameters.

AB This paper presents the design of a complete RTU (Remote Terminal Unit) with a System-on-Chip solution based completely on both open hardware and software platforms, and developed in conjunction with two industrial companies. The target implementation of the embedded system is a Spartan family FPGA from Xilinx. The article presents the main features of the base system, which consists of the LEON microprocessor and a Linux operating system distribution (Debian) running on it. Moreover, it shows a complete example of how to add new peripherals to the system. The peripheral that has been added is the UART 16550 compatible peripheral available in OpenCores. Given that the design has been prepared for the WishBone bus, it was necessary to adapt it to the APB bus within the LEON core. Furthermore, it has been adapted to work with the Linux driver for that UART to get a full coupling of peripheral with the system. The experimental results confirm the work done.

AB A current trend in learning programs, even at high-degree studies, is applying the concepts of "learning by projects". In this context, the LEGO (R) MINDSTORMS (R) NXT modular robot appears as a simple, flexible and attractive educational platform to achieve the referred challenge in many domains of information technologies, especially in real-time control. The project team can operate with the real system (e.g. constructed robot) to realize a number of particular tasks. The ready-to-use embedded platform and dual microcontrollers architecture represents actual trends in the modern control systems designs. The open hardware and software architecture gives unlimited possibility to handle all devices connected to the main control brick and write effective control algorithms.
   The proposed rescue robot project is a good example of the simple system where, a number of real-time control problems can be analyzed. The project on this scale requires detailed planning, cooperation in teams, extensive literature survey, and comprehensive software design. That is exactly, what we need for "learning by projects" concept.

AB A simple digital receiver named "GNU Radio Beacon Receiver (GRBR)" was developed for the satellite-ground beacon experiment to measure the ionospheric total electron content (TEC). The open-source software toolkit for the software defined radio, GNU Radio, is utilized to realize the basic function of the receiver and perform fast signal processing. The software is written in Python for a LINUX PC. The open-source hardware called Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP), which best matches the GNU Radio, is used as a front-end to acquire the satellite beacon signals of 150 and 400 MHz. The first experiment was successful as results from GRBR showed very good agreement to those from the co-located analog beacon receiver. Detailed design information and software codes are open at the URL http://www.rish.kyoto-u.ac.jp/digitalbeacon/.

AB The last developments of the home gateways, DSL-boxes, off-the-shelf wireless routers, wireless communities initiatives have brought a great number of network hardware to the home. These different developments have been followed by different initiatives of "hacking the box" to be able to flash this specific hardware with open-source firmware resulting from the contribution of several open-source developers (OpenWrt, Freifunk...). Due to the lack of "open hardware" off-the-shelf available to adjust the platform to the home-networking (and networking) applications, OpenPattern is a project to develop such a hardware based on the inputs from the past initiatives and bringing a box based on an open hardware (i.e. open specifications of the targeted hardware), using a motherboard and able to receive daughterboard to expand the functionalities in conjunction with the current open source project to be using the box once this one is ready to be shipped.

AB Background: Studies suggest that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) participates in neural circuitry that is dysregulated in Panic Disorder (PD) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). We tested whether low-frequency repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) could normalize the overactivity of right frontal regions and thereby improve symptoms.
   Methods: Six patients with PD and comorbid MDD were treated with daily active 1-Hz rTMS to the right DLPFC for 2 weeks in this open-label trial.
   Results: Clinical improvements were apparent as early as the first week of treatment. After the second week, 5/6 of patients showed improvements in panic and anxiety, and 4/6 showed a decrease in depression, with sustained improvement at 6 months of follow-up. Right hemisphere resting motor threshold increased significantly after rTMS.
   Limitations: Limitations of this study are the open design and the small sample size.
   Conclusions: Slow rTMS to the right DLPFC resulted in significant clinical improvement and reduction of ipsilateral motor cortex excitability. Replications in larger sample will help to clarify the relevance of this preliminary data and to define the potential role of right DLPFC rTMS in panic with major depression. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB PURPOSE. To test the hypothesis that human choroidal blood flow (ChBF) may depend, not only on ocular perfusion pressure (OPP), but also on absolute mean arterial pressure ( MAP) and intraocular pressure (IOP).
   METHODS. There were two study days in an open design. On the first day, OPP was varied by elevating IOP during a squatting-induced increase in MAP (28 subjects). On the second day, only the IOP was increased (17 subjects). IOP was raised in stepwise increments by using the suction cup method. Subfoveal ChBF (laser Doppler flowmetry), MAP, and IOP were assessed, and OPP was calculated as 2/3(MAP - IOP). For correlation analysis, data from all subjects were pooled according to IOP and MAP, and correlation analyses were performed. RESULTS. When data from study day 1 were grouped according to IOP, no correlation was observed between ChBF and MAP; but ChBFs were lower, the higher the IOP (P < 0.001). When data were grouped according to MAP, a significant correlation was found between ChBF and IOP (P < 0.001), but correlations were independent of MAP. When data of study day 2 were pooled according to IOP, a correlation between ChBF and OPP was seen only at IOP > 40 mm Hg (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS. The data confirm previously published observations that the choroid shows some autoregulatory capacity during changes in OPP. In addition, the data indicate that the choroid regulates its blood flow better during exercise-induced changes in MAP than during an experimental increase in IOP.

AB Purpose: To investigate the tolerance of MR examinations in children and adolescents performed in a 1.5 Tesla MR scanner with an expanded bore diameter.
   Method and Materials: 163 patients, ages 4 to 25, underwent MR examinations in a 1.5 Tesla MR scanner with an open design (MAGNETOM Espree, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany), characterized by a compact length of 125 cm and an expanded 70 cm bore diameter. MR imaging of the brain was carried out in most cases (78.5%), followed by examinations of the spinal canal (9.8%), the extremities (9.2%) and the neck (2.5%). The patients were divided into four age groups and the success rate, motion artifacts and diagnostic quality of the MR examinations were assessed using a 3-grade scale.
   Results: In 119 of 163 patients (73.0%), MR examination was possible without any motion artifacts. With respect to the different age groups, 41.7 % of the 4 - 7-year-old children, 67.6 % of the 8-10-year-old children, 84.1% of the 11-16year-old children and 95.8 % of the patients older than 17 showed tolerance grade I without motion artifacts and excellent diagnostic image quality. In 39 of 163 children (23.9%), the MR images showed moderate motion artifacts but had sufficient diagnostic quality. With regard to the different age groups, 52.8 % of the 4 - 7-year-old children, 26.5 % of the 8 - 10-year-old children, 15.9 % of the 11 - 16-year-old children and none of the patients older than 17 showed tolerance grade 11 with moderate motion artifacts and sufficient diagnostic image quality. In only 4 of 124 children < 10 years old and I child > 10 years old, the MR examination was not feasible and had to be repeated under sedation.
   Conclusion: Pediatric MR imaging using a 1.5 Tesla MR scanner with an open design can be conducted in children and adolescents with excellent acceptance. The failure rate of 3.0 % of cases for pediatric MR imaging is comparable to that of a conventional low-field open MR scanner.

AB The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of milnacipran in the acute treatment of patients with panic disorder. Thirty-one patients who met Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders-IV criteria for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia were included in the study. Patients were initially treated with milnacipran 25 mg twice daily and then 50 mg twice daily until the 10th week. The treatment outcome and panic disorder severity were determined by the Panic Disorder Severity Scale, Panic Inventory, Clinical Global Impression and Hamilton Anxiety Scale, all of which were applied during every evaluation interview. Quality of life (WHOQOL-bref) was evaluated at baseline and at the end of the study. Missing data were handled by using the last observation carried forward for all participants who had taken at least one dose of study medication. Intention-to-treat was used in the analyses. Pharmacological treatment resulted in a clinically and statistically significant mean reduction in all severity measures. Remission (Clinical Global Impression <= 2) was obtained in 58.1% of the sample. Regarding WHOQOL, we found a significant improvement (P < 0.05) across treatment in all the domains studied. Although results may be influenced by the open design of this pilot study and by the small sample size, our findings suggest that milnacipran may be effective for the treatment of panic disorder and justify further research.

AB Context: Pegvisomant is a specific GH receptor antagonist that is able to normalize serum IGF-I concentrations in most patients with acromegaly. The impact of pegvisomant on insulin sensitivity and substrate metabolism is less well described.
   Patients and Methods: We assessed basal and insulin-stimulated (euglycemic clamp) substrate metabolism in seven patients with active acromegaly before and after 4-wk pegvisomant treatment (15 mg/d) in an open design.
   Results: After pegvisomant, IGF-I decreased, whereas GH increased (IGF-I, 621 +/- 82 vs. 247 +/- 33 mu g/liter, P = 0.02; GH, 5.3 +/- 1.5 vs. 10.8 +/- 3.3 mu g/liter, P = 0.02). Basal serum insulin and plasma glucose levels decreased after treatment (insulin, 54 +/- 5.9 vs. 42 +/- 5.3 pmol/ liter, P = 0.001; glucose, 5.7 +/- 0.1 vs. 5.3 +/- 0.0 mmol/liter, not significant), whereas palmitate kinetics were unaltered. During the clamp, the glucose infusion rate increased after pegvisomant (3.1 +/- 0.5 vs. 4.4 +/- 0.6 mg/kg.min, P = 0.02), whereas the suppression of endogenous glucose production tended to increase (0.7 +/- 0.0 vs. 0.5 +/- 0.1 mg/kg.min, not significant). Total resting energy expenditure decreased after pegvisomant treatment (1703 +/- 109 vs. 1563 +/- 101 kcal/24 h, P = 0.03), but the rate of lipid oxidation did not change significantly.
   Conclusions: 1) Pegvisomant treatment for 4 wk improves peripheral and hepatic insulin sensitivity in acromegaly. 2) This is associated with a decrease in resting energy expenditure, whereas free fatty acid metabolism is unaltered. 3) The data support the important direct effects of GH on glucose metabolism and add additional benefits to pegvisomant treatment for acromegaly.

AB Objective: To evaluate cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using a 0.35 T magnetic resonance system with open design.
   Methods: Eleven patients were examined in an open MRI system with a field strength of 0.35 T. Myocardial function was assessed with cine true fast imaging with steady-state precession sequences in 2 planes. Perfusion images were acquired with a T1-weighted gradient echo sequence. Late enhancement was performed using an inversion recovery-prepared fast gradient echo technique. Image quality was assessed using a 4-point score in consensus. Signal-noise ratio was measured.
   Results: For functional imaging, average score was 1.65 (SD, 0.6). For perfusion imaging, the value was 2.25 (SD, 0.68). For late enhancement, quality score was 2.6 (SD, 0.82). Average value of signal-noise ratio for functional, perfusion, and late enhancement imaging was 50.6 (SD, 16.4), 91.8 (SD, 52.8), and 33.2 (SD, 20.4), respectively.
   Conclusions: Open MRI with lower field strength can be used for functional imaging of the heart. For perfusion and viability imaging (late enhancement), higher field strength is needed. Open low-field cardiac MRI may provide a helpful alternative for obese or claustrophobic patients or patients who are difficult to move.

AB Organic materials offer new electronic functionality not available in inorganic devices. However, the integration of organic compounds within nanoscale electronic circuitry poses new challenges for materials physics and chemistry. Typically, the electronic states in organic materials are energetically misaligned with the Fermi level of metal contacts. Here, we study the voltage-induced change in conductivity in nanoscale devices comprising a monolayer of polyelectrolyte macromolecules. The devices are fabricated using integrated shadow masks. Reversible switching is observed between conducting ( ON) and non-conducting ( OFF) states in the devices. The open design of our devices easily permits chemical modification of the polyelectrolyte, which we show has a pronounced effect on the ON - OFF switching. We suggest that the switching voltage ionizes the polymers, creating a conducting channel of electronic levels aligned with the contact Fermi level.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of clozapine on plasma serotonin, platelet serotonin and monoamine oxidase (MAO) levels in schizophrenic patients and to compare their results with those of unmedicated healthy controls. Groups of 20 outpatients with schizophrenia and 20 healthy controls matched for age, sex and smoking status were recruited for the study. Psychopathology, neurocognitive functioning, plasma serotonin, platelet serotonin and MAO levels were assessed after I-week drug free interval, and 8 weeks after initiation of clozapine treatment in an open design. The mean clozapine dose at week 8 was 382.5 +/- 96.4 (range: 250-600) mg/day. In the patient group, at baseline, plasma serotonin and platelet MAO levels were significantly lower, and platelet serotonin levels were significantly higher than in controls. After 8 weeks of clozapine treatment, plasma serotonin and platelet MAO levels increased significantly, while a significant decrease in platelet serotonin levels was detected compared with baseline values. Baseline platelet MAO levels explained 22% of the variance in Clinical Global Impression-improvement (CGI-I) and improvement in attention, while baseline platelet serotonin predicted 23% of the variance in the improvement in positive symptoms during clozapine treatment. Our data indicate that clozapine may be reversing or compensating for a pre-existing alteration in serotonergic neurotransmission in schizophrenic patients. The prediction of response to clozapine through peripheral biochemical markers may have important clinical implications if repeated in larger samples. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB An open hardware architecture for a goal-oriented indoor mobile robot navigation based on corrected odometry information using fuzzy logic controller is presented in this paper. The proposed approach exploits the ability of mobile robots to navigate in unstructured, cluttered and potentially hostile environments using calibrated odometry information, proximity sensor data and a fuzzy logic engine. A key advantage to this technique is its simplicity over similar navigation systems discussed in the literature. The simplification stems from the fact that only the previous traveled position of the robot needs to be tracked to reach to the target position. The superiority of this technique is supported by the experimental results that were collected for this purpose.

AB SIS100 and SIS300 are the main accelerators of the FAIR project. The two stage synchrotron concept provides maximum intensities of heavy ion and proton beams in average and per cycle. To accommodate optimal technical solutions, the structure of the magnet lattices of both machines were recently reviewed and in case of SIS300 modified. Consequently, more appropriate technical solutions for the main magnets and quench protection systems could be adapted. The general machine layout and design, e.g. of the demanding extraction schemes, have been detailed and open design issues were completed. The development and design of all major technical systems is in progress and prototyping has started or is in preparation.

AB In this paper, we present a platform for system on chip (SoC) implementation that is suitable for telecommunication applications. To build the platform, we have adopted the OpenCores-Openhardware design concept. The benefit of using the OpenCores methodology is flexibility, reuse and accessibility of the cores at free cost. We demonstrate how the open hardware trend can help designers to build complex integrated circuits such as SoCs at low cost. To test the platform, our first application is a SoC implementation of a Voice Over IP (VoIP) Gateway. The first preliminary results show that the whole SoC can be implemented in the field programmable gate array (FPGA) - XC2V1000 circuit.

AB The open source software movement has been going on for a few decades now. Today, an increasing number of open source solutions enter the market and become valid alternatives to proprietary and closed solutions. Examples include operating systems like Linux and OpenSolaris, back-end solutions (e.g. LAMP - Linux, Apache web server, MySQL database, and Perl/PHP/Python programming languages - are among the most well-known and widely used open source software on the Internet), office applications (e.g. Firefox web browser, Thunderbird email, GIMP graphics, OpenOffice office suite), and complete enterprise systems like Compiere (ERP and CRM) and Mambo content management system (CMS). In addition, a variety of devices increasingly include open source (e.g. cellular phones, network equipment like routers, and Asterisk - a complete IP PBX).
   The open source culture is about much more than software and includes open source hardware, views on intellectual properties rights, completely changes how products are developed and owned, and how business models are developed.
   To decide if open source is something for you, a good understanding of what open source really means is necessary. This includes legal aspects (different licenses), availability of support with (hopefully a thriving) user community and commercial for-pay support options, and security.
   Intellectual properties rights, and the vast number of many types of open source licenses (e.g. GNU General Public License (GPL) and BSD License), is one of the more complex areas when using open source. What can and not can be done, what must be done, and so on, vary between licenses. One effort to bring some order in all this is the Open Source Definition (OSD) from Open Source Initiative (OSI) which lists ten conditions that must be met for an OSI Certified open source license.
   Today, many companies have already been forced to either remove or release as open source code borrowed by developers without properly complying with licenses. Such "dirty code" is increasingly easy to detect via compliance tools used by companies doing this as business. (Not to mention whistle-blowing employees tipping of property owners.) Searching for dirty code is also increasingly part of due diligence in mergers and acquisitions and can add costly delays and lawsuits.
   The perceived low cost is often a reason for considering open source solutions but the total costs of development (TCD) including for example licenses, tools, labor, and support - must be considered from initial design, to maintenance, all through the end of life of the product.
   This paper reviews critical aspects for going open source, including software and hardware, use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) alternatives, system design going from a monolithic, single-binary, firmware to a layered design with operating system, middleware, and user applications.

AB This paper is an invitation to the international community to participate in the usage and a substantial upgrade of the Dutch Open Telescope on La Palma (DOT, http://dot.astro.uu.nl)We first give a brief overview of the approach, design, and current science capabilities of the DOT. It became a successful 0.2-arcsee-resolution solar movie producer through its combination of (i) an excellent site, (ii) effective wind flushing through the fully open design and construction of both the 45-cm telescope and the 15-m support tower, (iii) special designs which produce extraordinary pointing stability of the tower, equatorial mount, and telescope, 00 simple and excellent optics with minimum wavefront distortion, and (n) largevolume speckle reconstruction including narrow-band processing. The DOT's multi-camera multi-wavelength speckle imaging system samples the solar photosphere and chromosphere simultaneously in various optical continua, the G band, CaIIH (tunable throughout the blue wing), and Ha (tunable throughout the line). The resulting DOT data sets are all public. The DOT database (http://dotdb.phys.uu.nl/DOT) now contains many tomographic image sequences with 0.2-0.3 aresec resolution and up to multi-hour duration. You are welcome to pull them over for analysis. The main part of this contribution outlines DOT upgrade designs implementing larger aperture. The motivation for aperture increase is the recognition that optical solar physics needs the substantially larger telescope apertures that became useful with the advent of adaptive optics and viable through the DOT's open principle, both for photospheric: polarimetry at high resolution and high sensitivity and for chromospheric fine-structure diagnosis at high cadence and full spectral sampling. Our upgrade designs for the DOT are presented in an incremental sequence of five options of which the simplest (Option 1) achieves 1.4 m aperture using the present tower, mount, fold-away canopy, and multi-wavelength speckle imaging and processing systems. The most advanced (Option V) offers unblocked 2.5 m aperture in an off-axis design with a large canopy, a wide 30-m high support tower, and image transfer to a groundbased optics lab for advanced instrumentation. All five designs employ adaptive optics. The important advantages of fully open, wind-transparent and wind-flushed structure, polarimetric constancy, and absence of primary-image rotation remain. All designs are relatively cheap through re-using as much of the existing DOT hardware as possible. Realization of an upgrade requires external partnership(s). This report about DOT upgrade options therefore serves also as initial documentation for potential partners.

Therefore, a case Studies of a building's rehabilitation at the historical center of Porto, Portugal, is here presented and analyzed. The flows of materials' mass and embodied energy related to the rehabilitation process were accounted, analyzed, and compared, as a way to measure the environmental benefits of materials reuse, and the preservation of their historical value. The results showed that in general selected dismantling highly contributes to the reduction of waste, its well to reduce the loss of the embodied energy, especially when compared with scenarios of only facade retention. The preservation of historic value of construction systems and materials also benefits of such approach by Supporting all open-design methodology, in order to select and update design solutions and construction procedures during the rehabilitation process.

AB Our planar SOFC stacking technology uses unprofiled metallic interconnects (MIC) and thin cells of tape cast anode supported YSZ. The key element is the gas diffusion layer (GDL) between cell and MIC, which consists of so-called SOFConneX (TM). Using square cells with internal manifolds, 0.5 W/cm(2) stack power density (800 degrees C) can be obtained on short stacks. However, this open design configuration limits the assembly of large stacks and the durability of operation, owing to postcombustion and redox cycling occurring at unprotected cell edges. A new design, inspired from modeling work and the adaptability of the SOFConneX (TM) GDL, led to oblong-shaped cells, assembled in a closed stack casing with external air manifolding and fuel recovery manifolding, avoiding postcombustion. While stack power density in both designs remains similar, the operation at increased fuel utilization has become more stable in the 2(nd) design. Furthermore, a correlation of performance homogeneity during stack testing was drawn to assembly quality control. A 36-cell stack in dilute H-2 at 800 degrees C achieved 625 W-el (28% LHV efficiency, 0.35 W/cm(2)) under continuous polarisation, with all 6 clusters of 6 cells showing coincident i-V-output.

   DEVICE
AB PURPOSE. To determine how severe peripheral field loss (PFL) affects the dispersion of eye movements relative to the head in patients walking in real environments. This information should help to define the visual field and clearance requirements for head-mounted mobility visual aids.
   METHODS. Eye positions relative to the head were recorded in five patients with retinitis pigmentosa who had less than 15 of visual field and in three normally sighted people, each walking in varied environments for more than 30 minutes. The eye-position recorder was made portable by modifying a head-mounted system (ISCAN, Burlington, MA). Custom data processing was implemented, to reject unreliable data. Sample standard deviations of eye position (dispersion) were compared across subject groups and environments.
   RESULTS. The patients with PFL exhibited narrower horizontal eye-position dispersions than did the normally sighted subjects (9.4 vs. 14.2, P < 0.0001), and the vertical dispersions of patients with PFL were smaller when they were walking indoors than when walking outdoors (8.2 vs. 10.3; P < 0.048).
   CONCLUSIONS. When walking, the patients with PFL did not increase their scanning eye movements to compensate for missing peripheral vision information. Their horizontal scanning was actually reduced, possibly because of lack of peripheral stimulation. The results suggest that a field of view as wide as 40 may be needed for closed (immersive) head-mounted mobility aids, whereas a much narrower display, perhaps as narrow as 20, may be sufficient with an open design.

ID SPRING CONSTANT; CANTILEVERS
AB We discuss a low-cost atomic force microscope that we have designed and built for use in an undergraduate teaching laboratory. This microscope gives students hands-on access to nano-Newton force measurements and subangstrom position measurements. The apparatus relies mainly on off-the-shelf components and utilizes an interferometric position sensor known as the interdigitated (ID) cantilever to obtain high resolution. The mechanical properties of the ID readout enable a robust and open design that makes it possible for students to directly control it. Its pedagogical advantage is that students interact with a complete instrument system and learn measurement principles in context. One undergraduate experiment enabled by this apparatus is a measurement of Boltzmann's constant, which is done by recording the thermal noise power spectrum of a microfabricated cantilever beam. In addition to gaining an appreciation of the lower limits of position and force measurements, students learn to apply numerous concepts such as digital sampling, Fourier-domain analysis, noise sources, and error propagation.

TI TraX: A device-centric middleware framework for location-based services
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Location-based services turned out not to be the "next big thing" following the success stories of GSM and SMS. The reasons for this are manifold and range from inaccurate cellular positioning technologies to a lack of competition in this field, both being closely related to the fact that positioning is controlled by a network-centric approach where the mobile network operator has the unique selling point for making position data available to third parties. However, things change: small, low-cost GPS receivers, either attachable to mobile devices or even integrated, are enjoying great popularity since their recent inception and are expected to become a standard feature of cell phones in the near future. In conjunction with mobile packet data services, they provide a basis for device-centric LBS platforms, where position data can be obtained directly from the mobile device. In this article the device-centric LBS middleware TraX, which focuses particularly on position management, advanced functions for interrelating the position data of several targets, and privacy protection, is presented. Due to its generic and open design, TraX can be reused for a broad range of different LBSs and thus fosters service diversity and multiprovider environments, both of which are essential for making the next generation of LBSs a success.

AB The main objective of this work was to study the functional markers of the clinical response to cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK-4). Twelve healthy male subjects were challenged with CCK-4 and simultaneously underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recording. Since anticipatory anxiety (AA) is an intrinsic part of panic disorder, a behavioral paradigm, using the threat of being administered a second injection of CCK-4, has been developed to investigate induced AA. The study was composed of three fMRI scans according to an open design. During first and second scan, subjects were injected with placebo and CCK-4, respectively. The third scan was the AA challenge. CCK-4 administration induced physiological and psychological symptoms of anxiety that met the criteria for a panic attack in 8 subjects, as well as cerebral activation in anxiety-related brain regions. Clinical and physiological response intensity was consistent with cerebral activity extent and robustness. fMRI proved more sensitive than clinical assessment in evidencing the effects of the AA challenge. The latter induced brain activation, different from that obtained on CCK-4 and during placebo injection, that was likely related to anxiety. The method applied in this study is suitable for the study of anxiety using fMRI. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Eye tracking has long held the promise of being a useful methodology for human computer interaction. However, a number of barriers have stood in the way of the integration of eye tracking into everyday applications, including the intrusiveness, robustness, availability and price of eye-tracking systems. To lower these barriers, we have developed the openEyes system. The system consists of an open-hardware design for a digital eye tracker that can be built from low-cost off-the-shelf components, and a set of open-source software tools for digital image capture, manipulation, and analysis in eye-tracking applications. We expect that the availability of this system will facilitate the development of eye-tracking applications and the eventual integration of eye tracking into the next generation of everyday human computer interfaces. We discuss the methods and technical challenges of low-cost eye tracking as well as the design decisions that produced our current system.

AB Aim: This comparative, open design, phase III study was to assess the non-inferiority of the non-preserved T-Gel 0.1% single dose unit (SDU) versus its preserved multidose (MD) reference.
   Methods: 175 patients with bilateral POAG or OHT were randomised: 87 patients were to receive one drop daily of T-Gel 0.1% MD and 88 patients were to receive one drop daily of T-Gel 0.1% SDU, for a treatment period of 12 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was the change in intraocular pressure (IOP) in the worse eye between the baseline and the last assessment. Subjective and objective ocular signs as well as adverse events were recorded for safety. Global tolerance was assessed by the investigator and by the patient.
   Results: The mean percentage reduction from baseline IOP was 24% for both treatments groups, which was consistent with previous studies. The safety results were comparable in both treatment groups. Because of gel formulation, mild short lasting episodes of blurred vision occurred for about 20% of patients. The global tolerance assessment reported that both treatments were well tolerated.
   Conclusion: The overall study results demonstrated that T-Gel 0.1% SDU is not inferior to T-Gel 0.1% MD.

DE acceleration sensor; strain sensor; civil infrastructure; smart sensor;

AB Industrialised nations have dedicated significant investments toward the development of civil infrastructure. To preserve this investment, attention must be given to proper maintenance. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has emerged as a tool to support this task. Networks of smart sensors, built upon wireless communication, have the potential to significantly improve SHM. Numerous platforms for smart sensors have been developed, most of which utilise proprietary hardware/software. The Berkeley Mote, utilised in this study, was the first open hardware/software platform to be developed. However, the Berkeley Mote was designed for generic applications and therefore the available sensors are not optimised for use in civil infrastructure applications. Acceleration and strain are among the most important physical quantities to judge the health of a structure. Although commercially available sensor boards have accelerometers, their applicability towards civil infrastructure is limited. This paper presents the development of new acceleration and strain sensor boards based on the Berkely-Mote platform and provides experimental verification of their performance within civil infrastructure applications.

The produced setup combines SPM techniques and advanced robotics approaches allowing to carry out both prolonged observations and spatial measurements on biological samples. As a result, enhanced force probing method based on scanning microscopy techniques and advanced robotics/automation approaches are integrated in this device. Visual and force feedback control are used to achieve automatic data acquisition and monitoring process when high skills are required. Preliminary in vitro experiments on human promyelocytic leukemia cells (NB4) are conducted in order to demonstrate the viability of the proposed design. Some relevant mechanical cell properties are extracted such as elasticity and viscosity parameters.

AB Momentum systems for older satellites are but individual CMGs built by the CMG manufacturer and integrated into the spacecraft by the spacecraft manufacturer. This has worked well in the past but new requirements and new technology is resulting in an integrated momentum sub-system approach that is providing major improvement for several programs currently in development. Recent advances in bearing and lubrication systems prove that wheels can be operated at much higher speeds. High speed and integration of momentum devices into a single sub-system combine to open design trade space leading to much smaller, lower cost and lighter weight momentum systems.
   An optimization program will be described and optimized CMG designs will be compared to existing CMGs. A cost function of equivalent weight used in the optimization program will be provided. The Ideal Rotor weight equation will be derived and a practical rotor weight equation provided to show the relationship between weight, speed, momentum value and size. The paper will describe how the new optimized designs will involve a minimum development risk. The paper is summarized with a discussion of some additional practical considerations including comments on schedule and cost.

DE urban redevelopment; public participation; stakeholder participation;
   design negotiation; design decision support
AB This paper examines how political commitment to participatory design within the context of a major urban redevelopment project was translated into a strategy and a course of action for achieving effective participation within a demanding project timeframe. The project in question involves a new transport interchange for the city of Auckland (New Zealand), the redevelopment of a number of heritage buildings, and the introduction of new buildings to create a mixed use precinct covering three city blocks.
   The project, currently being implemented, has involved extensive public consultation and stakeholder participation as it has proceeded through the stages of project visioning, an open public design competition, and the development of the competition winning design. The paper draws a distinction between the contributions of stakeholders versus the public at large to the decision-making process, outlines the different kinds of participatory processes adopted by the local authority (Auckland City Council) to effectively engage and involve these two different groups and the stages in the evolution of the project at which these different contributions were introduced.
   The model of 'open design' proposed by van Gunsteren and van Loon is used as a basis for explaining the success of multi-stakeholder inputs at a crucial stage in project development. The paper concludes by examining the limits of applicability of the 'open design' model in the context of urban redevelopment projects in which there is broad public interest, and by suggesting a number of design decision support guidelines for the management of participatory processes.

AB This paper describes a novel emitter tip having the shape of a nib and based on an open structure for nano-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (nanoESI-MS). The nib structure is fabricated with standard lithography techniques using SU-8, an epoxy-based negative photoresist. The tip is comprised of a reservoir, a capillary slot and a point-like feature, and is fabricated on a silicon wafer. We present here a novel scheme for interfacing such nib tips to MS by applying the ionization voltage directly onto the semi-conductor support. The silicon support is in direct contact with the liquid to be analyzed at the reservoir and microchannel level, thus allowing easy use in ESI-MS. This scheme is especially advantageous for automated analysis as the manual step of positioning a metallic wire into the reservoir is avoided. In addition, the analysis performance was enhanced compared with the former scheme, as demonstrated by the tests of standard peptides (gramicidin S, Glu-fibrinopeptide B). The limit of detection was determined to be lower than 10(-2) mu M. Due to their enhanced performance, these microfabricated sources might be of great interest for analysis requiring very high sensitivity, such as proteomics analysis using nanoESI-MS.

It has recently been evaluated for the treatment of tension-type headaches in patients who are unable to tolerate or cannot benefit from standard therapies. Most of the open design studies seem to present positive results. However, the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies present contradictory results for the efficacy of botulinum toxin. Based on these data, further controlled trials of botulinum toxin are needed to evaluate its effects on tension headaches and to determine optimal injection sites, doses, and frequency of treatments.

AB The Differentiated Services (Diffserv) architecture is a scalable solution for providing Quality of Service (QoS) over packet switched networks. By its very definition, Diffserv is not designed to offer strict performance guarantees to its subscribers, and the actual differentiation between the service classes is currently left as an open design issue. We consider in this paper the notion of relative performance guarantees. Specifically, the goal of the network manager is to maintain pre-defined ratios between the average delays of the-different service classes. For that purpose, the manager judiciously allocates available capacity between the service classes. This scheme is studied within a traffic flow model, with self-optimizing users who can choose their input flow rate to each service class. The entire problem is naturally formulated as a noncooperative game, where the players are the network manager and the individual users. Concentrating on a single link model with multiple service classes, we demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium, and address the efficient computation of the capacity assignment in equilibrium. We further provide an adaptive capacity adjustment scheme which is applicable when the user model is unknown. We briefly outline extension of our results to a general network topology, and the role of pricing and admission control within the proposed framework.

AB In this paper we present the technology choices for implementing wireless sensor networks (WSN), which can be used for in-situ environmental monitoring. WSN is an embedded, massively distributed networking paradigm consisting of large number of intelligent, multitask sensor devices connected mainly via short-range wireless links. The unique features, requirements, and applications of WSN lead to many open design and implementation issues. In this paper, we survey the sensor network technology by focusing on its basic structure and usage. In addition, we define two problems in WSN (coverage and communication) that are the core of any WSN deployment. Finally, we present an initial experimental result of a simple WSN test-bed using our design methodology with applications to environmental monitoring.

AB Object To compare efficacy and safety of milnacipran and fluoxetine in a population of Korean patients with major depression.
   Research design and methods: The design was a multi-centre, randomised, comparative clinical study. Patients with major depression (DSM-IV diagnostic criteria) scoring over 17 points on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) and over 21 points on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) were recruited and randomised to receive milnacipran (50 mg/day increasing after 1 week to 100 mg/day) or fluoxetine (20 mg/day) for 6 weeks. All previous medication was stopped at least 7 days before entry into the study. Patients were evaluated (HAM-D, MADRS and clinical global impression scale, CGI) at baseline and after 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks of treatment. All adverse events which developed during the study period were recorded.
   Results., 70 patients (milnacipran 39; fluoxetine 31) were included in the study. Total score on both HAM-D, MADRS and CGI decreased significantly in both groups after 1 week and continued to decrease throughout the study. There was no significant difference between the two groups for any measurement at any time point. Both antidepressants were well tolerated. In the milnacipran group, 13 patients reported 28 adverse reactions, and in the fluoxetine group 11 patients reported 18 adverse reactions. Two patients discontinued due to adverse events in the milnacipran group and three in the fluoxetine group. There were no clinically significant modifications in vital signs, routine blood laboratory tests, biochemistry or ECG throughout the study. Nausea and headache were the most frequently reported adverse events with milnacipran while digestive disturbances, diarrhoea and insomnia were more common with fluoxetine.
   Conclusion: Milnacipran, like fluoxetine, was found to be effective and well tolerated for the treatment of major depression in this population of depressed Korean patients. Principal limitations of the study were its open design, its small sample size and its relatively short duration.

AB This study creates a landfill design application in a server that can be accessed by engineers via the World Wide Web. Through this system, engineers can Complete a side slope design and/or landfill evaluation. Instead of using traditional engineering computation techniques to analyze a problem, this study presents a new method that uses a database to analyze landfill slope stability problems. Creating usable databases for interpolation and engineering requirements are the two important topics reported here. This study demonstrates that the proposed technique save significant time in a problem solving timesaving and a good tool for e-learning. The proposed method uses an open design environment through the WWW and presents diverse results from the databases. The desired side slope landfill angle can be interpolated by assigning a safety factor and other problem requirements. The results of this system are not easily merits using the current prevailing engineering analysis computer programs.

AB Purpose: There is some indirect evidence for altered autoregulation in patients with glaucoma, but only a few studies have measured ocular blood flow directly during changes in ocular perfusion pressure. The present study was designed to compare pulsatile choroidal blood flow and optic nerve head (ONH) blood flow during moderate increases in intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and normal controls.
   Design: Two nonrandomized studies comparing blood flow responses in glaucoma patients and controls in an open design.
   Participants and Controls: Sixteen patients with POAG glaucoma and 16 healthy gender-matched and age-matched controls were included in the choroidal blood flow experiments. The ONH blood flow experiment was performed in 14 POAG patients and 14 healthy gender-matched and age-matched controls.
   Methods: In the first study, pulsatile choroidal blood flow was assessed by laser interferometric measurement of fundus pulsation amplitude (FPA). In the second study, ONH blood flow was measured using laser Doppler flowmetry. In both cohorts, the IOP was increased stepwise by 10 and 20 mmHg using a suction cup.
   Main Outcome Measures: Fundus pulsation amplitude and ONH blood flow.
   Results: The baseline values of FPA and ONH blood flow were lower in glaucoma patients as compared with age-matched and gender-matched healthy controls. In patients with POAG, FPA decreased by -4.5 +/- 5.8% and -11.3 +/- 4.9% during elevation of IOP of 10 and 20 mmHg, respectively. These results were not different from the results in healthy controls, where FPA decreased by -5.1 +/- 3.4% and -12.21 +/- 4.9% at the 2 pressure levels (P = 0.23 between groups). Optic nerve head blood flow showed no changes during the increase of IOP of 10 and 20 mmHg in either of the 2 groups (glaucoma patients, +2.1 +/- 14.7% and -0.8 +/- 15.2%; healthy controls, +4.3 +/- 12.0% and +0.2 +/- 14.2%; P = 0.83 between groups).
   Conclusions: The present study does not provide evidence for altered autoregulation in patients with POAG during a moderate increase in IOP. However, these results do not necessarily contradict the concept of vascular dysregulation in glaucoma.

AB Service innovation is a top priority within the service provider community, and video services are at the top of that list. Video delivery generates the most lucrative form of service innovation and revenue generation, for both wireline and wireless service providers. Four service categories - video messaging, video telephony and surveillance, video download and broadcast video - generate new opportunities for service creation and differentiation.
   Service providers interested in entering the video market face three significant challenges:
   Beyond establishing a brand identity as a video player, competitive entrants must undertake awareness and education efforts, to accompany new product launches.
   These telecommunications players must negotiate and secure mutually beneficial partnerships within the content community, to deliver a robust value proposition.
   Legacy infrastructure challenges must be addressed, requiring planned network upgrades to satisfy traffic growth projections.
   Accordingly, a phased approach that allows new entrants to gain a competitive foothold and gradually increase network and market capabilities, in pursuit of penetration goals, optimises the juxtaposition between gaining speed-to-market and ultimately delivering competitively differentiable services.
   To deliver true user-centric video services requires a fundamentally open network design, and achieving that open design must be a key consideration during all of the phases of a service provider's evolution. The ideal design is an open service delivery platform, an end-to-end framework offering mobile and fixed video telephony and content solutions, including:
   rapid service creation and risk mitigation, so that service providers can enter the market aggressively;
   mobile video solutions with optimised quality across multiple networks, from GPRS to UMTS, giving service providers a jump-start in delivering video entertainment to mobile devices;
   and integration of fixed and mobile applications, offering service providers a truly differentiable position, by elevating the recently hyped 'quadruple play' beyond simple billing discounts.
   By offering users increasing control over video entertainment content and providing accessibility to content and contacts through various forms of interactive communication, service providers will successfully capitalise on critical trends driving consumer adoption.

AB The present simulation study elaborates on a finite element (FE) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model (Gerogiorgis and Ydstie, 2003a) developed for a candidate carbothermic aluminium reactor (Johansen and Aune, 2002), aimed at industrial implementation of carbothermic Al production. Carbothermic reduction is an alternative to the conventional Hall-Heroult electrolysis process and is characterized by cost and environmental advantages as well as by a challenging complexity. Process technology encompasses a wide spectrum of phenomena (convection, diffusion, reaction, evapouration, electric field) that occur simultaneously in a multiphase configuration, the geometry of which is an open design problem and remains to be determined without prior experience or even abundance of experimental data. The strong interaction among Joule heating, endothermic reaction, natural Boussinesq convection and turbulent flow phenomena is of paramount importance for understanding reactor performance; conducting CFD simulations is an efficient way to advance with the latter goal, since reliable high-temperature measurements of state variables are remarkably laborious, uncertain and expensive. The quadruple partial differential equation (PDE) problem (electric charge, heat, momentum and gas volume balances) for the slag flow in the ARP reactor is solved via a commercial CFD software suite (FEMLAB (R) v. 2.3) to obtain potential, temperature, velocity and gas volume fraction distributions in a two-dimensional domain, representing in detail the complete second stage of the proposed carbothermic reactor. The new challenge is the present paper is to accurately calculate the volume fraction of the gas generated within the molten slag and understand how the proposed geometry affects production, via the instantaneous thermodynamic equilibrium assumption. The main objective of this CFD study is to extract conclusions regarding the reactive slag flow, the extent of space utilization and the existence of dead volumes, and to provide design guidelines. A steady state sensitivity analysis of state variable distributions (namely, potential, temperature, velocity and gas volume fraction) with respect to a key design variable (the imposed voltage profile) reveals the reactor heating potential, the geometry of the Al region and the nontrivial operation, design and optimization problems.

AB In design of high performance heatsinks, it is vital to understand how the primary constraints of volumetric footprint and hydraulic operating point limit maximum thermal performance. This paper provides a framework to establish a priori maximum attainable levels of air-side cooling performance for a given class of fin geometry over a basis of continuously varied footprint and hydraulic constraints. A model or packaging volume required for air moving devices to deliver flow and pressure is developed. It is shown how single fin thermal model results may be extrapolated to multiple fan-heatsink combinations within an open design space. A method to identify fin-fan combinations to achieve maximum system volumetric conductance levels is presented. The methodology is extendable to other volumetricaly constrained heat exchanger problems.

AB In order to evaluate the incidence of hereditary bleeding disorders in patients presenting with menorrhagia, where the usual gynecological and endocrinal causes of bleeding were ruled out by various local ultrasonography (USG) and relevant endocrine investigations, 120 women aged between 18 and 35 years presenting with menorrhagia without any discernable cause were studied using an open design, where the investigators knew that these patients had menorrhagia. These patients were investigated for inherited coagulation defects. Of the 120 women investigated, 19.16% (23 cases) had an inherited coagulation disorder to account for their menorrhagia. Although a majority (11.6%) are patients with von Willebrand's disease (VWD), other rare platelet disorders such as Glanzmann's thrombasthenia (3.3%), Bernard-Soulier syndrome (0.83%), coagulation factor deficiencies such as factor VIII (0.83%), factor X (0.83%), and factor XI (0.83%), and immune thrombocytopenia (0.83%) were also found. Taking a detailed history for bleeding from other sites howsoever minor, paternal consanguinity as well as family history of bleeding tendencies appeared as a very strong predictor for such kinds of disease in patients with menorrhagia. Patients with menorrhagia without a discernable cause, therefore, need evaluation for the congenital coagulation disorders.

   PEDICLE; SCAR; COMPLICATIONS
AB Current criticisms regarding vertical mammaplasty include problems with poor immediate postoperative appearance, nipple-areola complex malposition, and excessive lower pole length. These problems can be avoided by proper patient selection, by utilizing correct concepts of skin design, and by observing correct glandular resection and closure concepts. Vertical mammaplasty also can result in other problems, such as hypertrophic circumareolar scars and lower pole deformities, including notching, boxy shape, infra-areolar depression, and flatness. These problems are also largely avoidable by using correct technique.
   Several basic concepts described previously have not proven necessary to achieve good results. Abandoning some of these principles has contributed to the ability to establish an aesthetically ideal breast shape intraoperatively as well as to a decrease in morbidity. This includes eliminating liposuction as a major integral component of the procedure, eliminating suturing the gland to the pectoralis muscle, not undermining the lower pole skin, and avoiding overly, wide skin resection and tight wound closure that produces significant lower pole distortion in the early postoperative period.
   An important concept that has proven reliable is to use a "closed" design that does not predetermine the areolar opening whenever circumstances permit. When this is not possible, a modification that utilizes the smallest possible circumference as an open design is better than a large "mosque." These alternatives allow greater flexibility in determining final nipple position and also reduce the risk of hypertrophic circumareolar scars.
   Important glandular resection concepts include creating pillars that are attached to both the skin and the chest wall; making them of adequate dimension to avoid postoperative lower pole shape problems, such as flattening, resecting closer to the skin lateral to the pillars to avoid a boxy breast shape; and using a drain both to assist in accurately determining the endpoint of resection and to avoid postoperative seromas.
   Key closure concepts include approximation of the superior surfaces of the pillars at their base to maintain vertical height and thereby prevent lower pole flattening; approximation of the inferior surfaces of the pillars to the base of the breast to prevent notching; and proper management of the vertical incision by restricting the purse-string suture effect to only the inferior portion of the incision, where there may be skin excess present.
   Inclusion of these concepts leads to predictable and improved aesthetic results in vertical mammaplasty. This allows full realization of the purported advantages of vertical mammaplasty and allows this method to be utilized With a level of confidence similar to that seen with inverted-T techniques.

AB The present study examined the effect of smoking reduction and cessation on asthma regulation and biomarkers of exposure to cigarette smoke. In a prospective open design, we allocated 220 asthmatics among three groups: (a) Smoking reduction (reducers), with the aim of smoking fewer than seven cigarettes per day, (b) complete smoking cessation (abstainers), or (c) continuation of usual smoking (continuing smokers). Subjects used nicotine chewing gum or an oral nicotine inhaler to promote reduction and cessation. We monitored changes in the biomarkers carbon monoxide, cotinine, and thiocyanate, and in peak flow, medicine use, bronchial reactivity, and asthma symptoms. The analysis used the three outcome groups, regardless of original allocation to treatment groups. At 4 months, analysis of abstainers (n=27), reducers (n=33), and continuing smokers (n=50) showed marked, statistically significant decreases in expired carbon monoxide of 17 ppm (abstainers) and 15 ppm (reducers); in plasma cotinine of 124 ng/ml (abstainers) and 122 ng/ml (reducers); and in plasma thiocyanate of 5.03 ng/ml (abstainers) and 3.74 ng/m (reducers). For abstainers, we observed improvements in the asthma-specific quality-of-life score, and reductions in self-reported day and night use of rescue beta(2)-agonists, in doses of inhaled corticosteroids, in daytime asthma symptoms, and in bronchial hyperreactivity. For reducers, smaller improvements occurred for night use of rescue beta(2)-agonists, doses of inhaled corticosteroids, and bronchial hyperreactivity. Smoking cessation resulted in a marked decrease in three biomarkers of cigarette smoke inhalation and improved asthma regulation, whereas smoking reduction had a less pronounced effect on biomarkers and only a small effect on asthma regulation.

AB With the new and powerful Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) families, new possibilities have been opened. One of these features is the possibility of reconfiguring a section of the FPGA while the rest is working. Moreover, this fixed part could be responsible for reprogramming the reconfigurable part, either because a change in functionality is required or because a new version of the hardware needs to be implemented. This paper shows how an FPGA system based on an Open Source OpenRISC 1200 microprocessor takes advantage of this feature to perform the Secure Download of the firmware and the hardware needed to run an application. In this particular case a Reed-Solomon Encoder and a Cryptographic application were used to demonstrate the viability of the scheme.

AB There were two trials involved in the experiment. Trial 1: the trial was conducted on two Taiwan Sugar Corporation (TSC) pig farms. One was located in the north of Taiwan and the other was located in the south. Both farms had wet pad and forced ventilation (WPFV) and conventional open design (COD) boar and sow houses. There were 12 Duroc boars, age ranging from 12-24 months. Half of them (6 boars) were raised in a WPFV pig house, and the other half were kept in a COD house. Semen was collected at 5-day intervals from May 1(st) to the end of October. Sixteen sows (2-8 parity) were served by artificial insemination each week from the beginning of May to the end of Oct. These sows were checked for heat from 18 days to 25 days after insemination. Trial 2: there were four MPFV boar houses involved in the test. Two houses were located in the north of Taiwan, and the other two houses were located in the south. The test was conducted from January 2000 to December 2001. The total number of serviced sows by MPFV-housed boars was 35,105 head and for COD-housed boars 103,065 head. The results showed that the total semen volume, density of sperm, total sperm per ejaculate, sperm motility and morphological abnormality were significantly better (p < 0.01) for boar raised in WPFV house than for COD houses. Average sperm motility in June and July was lower than for the other months. Morphological abnormality was higher during May, June and July. Although the results did not reach a significant level, the average value showed that the total volume of boar semen was higher in the - north than for the south. The total semen volume production of boar raised in WPFV was higher than for boars raised in COD house, reaching a significant level only in summer. Boars kept in WPFV house had higher total sperm number than boars kept in COD house, reaching a significant level in spring (p < 0.05), summer (p < 0.01), and fall (p < 0.05) but not in winter (p > 0.05). Boars raised in WPFV house had significantly higher sperm motility than boars in COD house during spring (p < 0.001), summer (p < 0.001), fall (p < 0.01) and winter (p < 0.05). The average farrowing rate and piglets born alive were higher for boars in WPFV house than for boars in COD house, but neither reached a significant level (p > 0.05). The present experiment shows that WPFV house can improve the reproduction performance of boars.
