The mildly-outlandish idea behind the move, Engadget reports, is to give a boost to future generations after a hypothetical civilization-ending catastrophe. Should that happen, whatever civilization emerges from the ashes won’t have to start from scratch and could instead tap the knowledge of modern-day coders and engineers.",Related content,,,

During the interviews, participants described their research workflows and responded to a quantitative checklist measuring reproducible behaviors. While none of the workshop participants completely changed their workflows, many of them did incorporate new practices, tools, or methods that helped make their work more reproducible and transparent to other researchers. This indicates that programming workshops now offered by libraries and other organizations contribute to computational reproducibility training for researchers.",Related content,,,

To enable such an isoform-level analysis, a transcriptome assembly algorithm is utilized to stitch together the observed short reads into the corresponding transcripts. This task is complicated due to the complexity of alternative splicing - a mechanism by which the same gene may generate multiple distinct RNA transcripts. Mao et al develop a novel genome-guided transcriptome assembler, RefShannon, that exploits the varying abundances of the different transcripts, in enabling an accurate reconstruction of the transcripts.

The number of such plasmids increased from 12,000 to over 300,000 among three of the largest repositories: iGEM, Addgene, and DNASU. A challenge in biodesign remains how to use these and other repository-based sequences effectively, correctly, and seamlessly. This work describes an approach to plasmid design where a plasmid is specified as simply a DNA sequence or list of features. The proposed software then finds the most cost-effective combination of synthetic and PCR-prepared repository fragments to build the plasmid via Gibson assembly. ",,,,

Thomas & Jochen Gehrig ,Research Article,2020-03-03,BMC Bioinformatics,"The localization of objects of interest is a key initial step in most image analysis workflows. For biomedical image data, classical image-segmentation methods like thresholding or edge detection are typically used. While those methods perform well for labelled objects, they are reaching a limit when samples are poorly contrasted with the background, or when only parts of larger structures should be detected. Furthermore, the development of such pipelines requires substantial engineering of analysis workflows and often results in case-specific solutions. Here Thomas and Gehrig propose a new straightforward and generic approach for object-localization by template matching that utilizes multiple template images to improve the detection capacity.",,,,

Discovery and comparison of structures such as modular communities, rich clubs, hubs, and trees yield insight into the generative mechanisms and functional properties of the graph. Often, two graphs are compared via a pairwise distance measure, with a small distance indicating structural similarity and vice versa. Common choices include spectral distances and distances based on node affinities. However, no comparative study of the efficacy of these distance measures in discerning between common graph topologies at different structural scales has been presented. In this work, Wills and Meyer compare commonly used graph metrics and distance measures, and demonstrate their ability to discern between common topological features found in both random graph models and real world networks.",,,,

The authors constructed and applied a framework for sustainability drawing from other disciplines that have more published work focusing on sustainability of projects. This framework had seven sustainability influences, and three ways of defining sustainability. Using this framework, they evaluated outputs of projects funded by the U.S. Geological Survey’s Community for Data Integration and found that the various outputs are widely accessible, but not necessarily sustained or maintained. The authors conclude by summarizing lessons for individuals applying for short-term funding, and for organizations managing programs that provide such funding, for maximizing sustainability of project outcomes.",,,,

Amarante, Jonathan Newport, Meagan Mitchell, Joshua Wilson and Mark Laubach",Research Article,2019-10-17,eNeuro,"Syringe pumps are a necessary piece of laboratory equipment that are used for fluid delivery in behavioral neuroscience laboratories. Many experiments provide rodents and primates with fluid rewards such as juice, water, or liquid sucrose. Current commercialized syringe pumps are not customizable and do not have the ability to deliver multiple volumes of fluid based on different inputs to the pump. Additionally, many syringe pumps are expensive and cannot be used in experiments with paired neurophysiological recordings due to electrical noise. The authors developed an open source syringe pump controller using commonly available parts. The syringe pump controller aims to enable new experiments to address the potential confound of temporal information in studies of reward signaling by fluid magnitude.",,,,

Several demonstrations were made successfully over fiber networks, but not much work has been done yet through the open air where atmospheric turbulence prevails. Here, the authors use an 18 km outdoor link to transmit multiple optical carriers extracted directly from a frequency comb of a 4.2 THz spectral width. In stabilization to a high-finesse cavity with a 1.5 Hz linewidth, the comb-rooted optical carriers are simultaneously transferred with collective suppression of atmospheric phase noise to −80 dBc Hz−1. Microwaves are also delivered by pairing two separate optical carriers bound with inter-comb-mode coherence, for example a 10 GHz signal with phase noise of −105 dBc Hz−1 at 1 Hz offset. Lastly, an add-on demonstration is given for multi-channel coherent optical communications with the potential of multi-Tbps data transmission in free space.",,,,

This limitation has posed several challenges in preoperative planning, communication in medical practice, and medical education. This study aims to investigate the dimensional accuracy and the clinical value of 3D printed model of CHD in the above three areas. Methods: Using cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA) data, a patient-specific 3D model of a 20-month-old boy with double outlet right ventricle was printed in Tango Plus material. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to evaluate correlation of the quantitative measurements taken at analogous anatomical locations between the CCTA images pre- and post-3D printing. Qualitative analysis was conducted by distributing surveys to six health professionals (two radiologists, two cardiologists and two cardiac surgeons) and three medical academics to assess the clinical value of the 3D printed model in these three areas. Results: Excellent correlation (r = 0.99) was noted in the measurements between CCTA and 3D printed model, with a mean difference of 0.23 mm. Four out of six health professionals found the model to be useful in facilitating preoperative planning, while all of them thought that the model would be invaluable in enhancing patient-doctor communication. All three medical academics found the model to be helpful in teaching, and thought that the students will be able to learn the pathology quicker with better understanding. Conclusion: The complex cardiac anatomy can be accurately replicated in flexible material using 3D printing technology. 3D printed heart models could serve as an excellent tool in facilitating preoperative planning, communication in medical practice, and medical education, although further studies with inclusion of more clinical cases are needed.
