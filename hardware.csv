Real-world deployment of microgrids requires hands-on experience in three key areas: education, research, and development. Most undergraduate and graduate classes on microgrids today take a theoretical learning approach, and the few that offer laboratory sessions often use analog based systems. In the microgrid research community, advanced control and optimization are often validated using numerical simulations or very specific and expensive lab hardware. This area of study also lacks a development platform for users to do rapid prototyping of microgrid solutions, making real-world implementation challenging. This paper introduces EnerGyan [1], a low-cost platform for education, research, and development for energy management in microgrids. It is a portable end-to-end platform which integrates energy infrastructure (energy sources, converters, storage, loads), communication and computing infrastructure (on-board computer, communication modules, user interfaces), and an energy management system, making it a programmable electricity-grid-in-a-box. EnerGyan also provides a software toolkit called EnerGyanToolKit, allowing users to develop and deploy energy applications. EnerGyan has been used for microgrid research, in teaching (workshops, lab course, hackathons), and as development tool (for managing a building microgrid).","2018-12","2019-09-13 10:58:05","2019-09-13 10:58:05","","1-6","","","","","","EnerGyan","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/DYGGURWH/figures.html; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/2938KTP2/Manur et al. - 2018 - EnerGyan A Portable Platform for Microgrid Educat.pdf","","","Education; analog based systems; Batteries; communication and computing; distributed power generation; educational courses; Embedded computing; energy management; Energy management; energy management system; energy management systems; energy sources; energy system prototyping; EnerGyan; hands-on experience; Hardware; lab hardware; microgrid education; microgrid research community; microgrid solutions; microgrids; Microgrids; Optimization; programmable electricity-grid-in-a-box; research platform; student experiments; undergraduate classes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2018 IEEE International Conference on Power Electronics, Drives and Energy Systems (PEDES)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is a need to screen a given drug against a bacterial infection outside of the laboratory. To address this need, we have designed and built an inexpensive and easy-to-use 3D-printer-based system that allows easily readable quantitative tests for the performance of antibacterial drugs. The platform creates a sterile diagnostic device by using 3D printing, and the device is filled automatically with growth medium, and then antibiotics are sprayed onto the medium by ink-jet technology. The sample for testing can be introduced via a fluid port, and the printer hot bed is used to incubate the device, allowing operation in the field. Combining advantages from various established tests of antibacterial performance, this allows the comparison of a specific antibiotics and bacteria. Also, this system can create and test several antibiotic formulations for therapeutic use, and we demonstrate this potential by investigating a mixture of pathogens that are only killed by a mixture of drugs.","2016-09-08","2019-09-12 21:42:03","2019-09-12 21:42:03","2019-09-12 21:42:03","494-504","","3","1","","Chem","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/LEDNQPIE/Glatzel et al. - 2016 - A Portable 3D Printer System for the Diagnosis and.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/IMKYGQ5D/S2451929416301103.html","","","SDG3: Good health and well-being; SDG6: Clean water and sanitation; SDG9: Industry, innovation, and infrastructure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The broad design requirements included (i) fuselage capable of accommodating an imaging package or other instrumentation, (ii) suitability for over-lake BVLOS authorization in Switzerland, (iii) capability of land or water take-offs/landing, (iv) at least 90-min flight autonomy, (v) modularity of the imaging package and (vi) real-time IR/RGB imagery. Requirement (i) was to ensure an aircraft amenable to future developments. Requirements (ii)–(iv) were driven by the goal of improving estimates of lake surface energy fluxes, since such fluxes have a major impact on long-term lake temperatures and hence ecological status. Requirement (v), in conjunction with (i), allows the UAV to be adapted to other imaging applications. The real-time imagery requirement (vi) permits modifications of on-going missions to map areas of specific interest as they are detected. The prototype UAV produced to satisfy these characteristics was built on the twin-motor My Twin Dream (MTD) aircraft, which has a 1.8-m wing span airframe and a spacious fuselage. The legal authorization necessitated, where feasible, hardware redundancy as well as installation of a parachute system. Continuous communication between the ground station and UAV is provided by the LTE cellular telephone network. The UAV communication is handled by an on-board Linux computer, which is also responsible for control of the imagery package. The avionics involved modifications of the open-source APM autopilot software and the associated ground control station. A key modification was to support a custom-built emergency recovery system, which is triggered by loss of a heart-beat signal from the autopilot. The MTD airframe was modified to accommodate the system electronics and imaging hardware. Results from test flights over Lake Geneva demonstrate the ability of the aircraft to produce imagery data.","2018-04-01","2019-09-05 15:45:50","2019-09-05 15:45:50","2019-09-05 15:45:50","146-159","","","3","","HardwareX","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/IAM85RTG/Liardon et al. - 2018 - Lake imaging and monitoring aerial drone.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/ABZLBQHH/S2468067217300718.html","","","4G network; Autonomous aircraft; BVLOS; Imagery; Infrared; IR; LIMONAD; Mobile; Parachute; RGB; Streaming; Telemetry; UAV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OMIS consists of a 3D printed syringe pump, control hardware based upon the Arduino microcontroller and 3D printed reaction vessels. The OMIS syringe pump utilizes a low-power stepper motor which simplifies the instrument construction and allows for power to be supplied from batteries or the USB port of a computer. The simple design of OMIS allows for the instrument to be fabricated in one day, including the time to 3D print components. The OMIS syringe pump is able to deliver fluids at rates between 60 and 300 μL/min, depending on syringe size, with a reproducibility of 3%.

While the emitter piezoelectric is activated to sonicate the solution, the receiver piezoelectric translates the acoustic signal received into an electrical signal, which is measured and recorded by a digital oscilloscope. Multivariate calibration models were built for prediction of free glycerol concentration. In this sense, results of partial least square regression (PLS), the interval PLS (iPLS) and PLS coupled with the Successive Projections Algorithm for interval selection (iSPA-PLS) were compared. The proposed low-cost flow-batch analyzer exhibited good performance, satisfactory detection limit (0.12 mg kg−1) and a linear response from 72 to 372 mg kg−1 of free glycerol in biodiesel.

Further development in this area is coupling open source electronics with 3-D printable mechanical components to make fully functional distributedly-manufactured mechatronic tools for science. One research area where such low-cost technology is needed is to characterize thin film anti-reflective coatings and transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) for the glass, mirror and solar photovoltaic industry whose transmission properties are angle dependent. To meet this research need a low-cost 3-D printable open source dual axis gimbal system is presented in this study. An Arduino based microcontroller is used to move the sample holder to the user specified angle where two stepper motors control the motion providing two degrees of freedom. The sample holder is made in such a way that samples can easily be mounted on it by two movable latches. The system was validated and characterized for: i) unidirectional accuracy, ii) repeatability, iii) backlash, iv) speed resolution and v) microstep size. Finally, the mechatronic system is tested for the intended application using a halogen light source and a spectrometer to measure transmission through glass TCO samples through a hemisphere. The system performed as expected has a unidirectional accuracy of 2.827°, repeatability of 1.585°, backlash error of 1.237°, maximum speed of 35.156° and a verifiable microstep size of 0.33°. Despite the highest mean squared errors, the open source gimbal system performed adequately while measuring transmission of radiation through glass with TCO coatings. This open source system also represents a 96% cost in savings as compared to the least expensive commercial variant. The high mean squared errors are offset by the cost of the system coupled with its open source nature that promotes further collaboration and hence, development.","2018-12-01","2019-09-05 14:59:09","2019-09-05 14:59:13","2019-09-05 14:59:09","175-187","","","56","","Mechatronics","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/IMBQPTK2/Bihari et al. - 2018 - 3-D printable open source dual axis gimbal system .pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/LPBAIJ87/S0957415818301193.html","","","3-D printing; FOSH; Gimbal system; Open source hardware; Optoelectronics; Rotator; Transmittance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The electromagnetic section of these designs often include O(1000m2) of silicon pad sensors. For the luminosity measurement, a dedicated forward calorimeter called LumiCal is foreseen. More recently, the CMS experiment has decided to use the same concept in its endcap calorimeter upgrade for the HL-LHC. The sensors are typically produced from 6- or 8-inch wafers and consist of a few hundred smaller cells, each with an area of O(0.1 to 1cm2). For the prototyping phase of these projects, several design choices have to be evaluated while for mass production, thousands of sensors have to be tested for quality control. For the electrical characterisation of these sensors, it is important to bias them under realistic conditions. To fulfil these requirements, ARRAY, a compact, modular and cost efficient system for large area silicon pad sensor characterisation has been developed and successfully commissioned. It consists of two plugin printed circuit boards: an active switching matrix with 512 input channels that holds all controls and a passive probe card that connects to the sensor. The latter can then be adapted to any sensor geometry. All design files are open source. The system has been used to measure currents ranging from 500pA to 5μA and capacitances between 5pF and 100pF. A precision of better than 0.2pF on capacitance measurements in that range can be achieved. Examples of calibration and measurement results for leakage current and capacitance are presented.","2019-10-01","2019-09-05 14:53:18","2019-09-05 14:53:18","2019-09-05 14:53:17","168-173","","","940","","Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment","ARRAY","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/T7FN35EK/Brondolin et al. - 2019 - ARRAY An open source, modular and probe-card base.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/MDTINUM3/S0168900219308253.html","","","Quality control for silicon sensors; Silicon pad detectors; Silicon sensor characterisation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This “Do-It-Yourself” interface comprised a 1.0m×0.25mm segment of MTX-5 metallic column and a low-cost DC power supply. Thermal desorption modulation (TDM) was attained using a dual-stage heater-based modulator in a novel segmented-loop configuration. TDM was achieved by alternating analyte trapping and thermal desorption. Former process relied on analyte partition to sorbent phase, while latter explored direct resistive heating. Introduction of an intermediate delay segment between the two stages mitigated analyte breakthrough, improving peak symmetry and chromatographic efficiency. This feature was critical to acquire reliable GC×GC modulation using such simple heater-based device. The effects of important modulation variables on 2D separations were investigated, including TDM stage length, dimension of delay loop, and outlet pressure. Significant advances and limitations of proposed TDM strategy were carefully determined. Proposed GC×GC prototype by using an in-oven TDM modulator was successfully applied to a series of challenging matrices, including petroleum distillates, biodiesel, and essential oil. This open-hardware, cost-effective modulator was easy to install and operate, as it circumvented the need for sophisticated components (e.g. moving parts and cooling systems). Therefore, our modulator is a compelling alternative to existing GC×GC solutions to operate in resource-limited laboratories.","2017-03-01","2019-09-05 06:32:51","2019-09-05 06:32:51","2019-09-05 06:32:51","470-476","","","164","","Talanta","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/TJ62X5SN/S0039914016309444.html","","","Chemical education; Mass spectrometry; Multidimensional gas chromatography; Petroleum; Poly(dimethylsiloxane); Volatile organic compound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To date, PBA has required expensive (∼5K USD), desktop-based light sources to drive these photopolymerization reactions, which has limited its use in limited-resource areas and for POCT applications. Here, we present a portable, lightweight, and low-cost device that can generate light of the intensity and wavelengths required to perform the PBA reactions rapidly (<100 s) with minimal energy consumption.

A modular, platform-based, approach is the way to obtain this result. Modular approaches are common for software development, but hardware is still crafted often re-inventing solutions every time. As a consequence, the resources that should be invested in the development of a new robot get often drained by the implementation of a physical, working prototype to test the application idea. To overcome this problem, we propose R2P (Rapid Robot Prototyping), a framework to implement real-time, high-quality architectures for robotic systems with off-the-shelf basic modules (e.g., sensors, actuators, and controllers), integrating hardware and software, which can be assembled in a plug-and-play way. R2P provides hardware modules, a protocol for real-time communication, a middleware to connect components as well as tools to support the development of software on the modules. R2P aims at dramatically reduce time and efforts required to build a prototype robot, making it possible to focus the resources on the development of new robotic applications instead of struggling on their implementation. This enables also people with experience in a specific application domain, but with little technical background, to actively participate in the development of new robotic applications. R2P is open-source both in its software and hardware to promote its diffusion among the robotics community and novel business models that will substantially reduce the costs to design a new robotic product.","2014-07-01","2019-09-05 06:29:50","2019-09-05 06:29:50","2019-09-05 06:29:50","1073-1084","","7","62","","Robotics and Autonomous Systems","R2P","Reconfigurable Modular Robotics","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/TQDDHWIE/S092188901300153X.html","","","Open hardware; Low-cost robotics; Modular robotics; Off-the-shelf hardware components; Rapid robot prototyping","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The developed system consists of the signal conditioning circuit and the Arduino Due with an SD Shield for data storage. The suitability of the equipment for the application of the H/V method has been first assessed in the laboratory, according to the experimental sensitivity, the internal noise stability and the channel consistency. Subsequently, experimental verification has been carried out by recording seismic noise at eight different sites along the province of Alicante (southeast Spain), with different soil characteristics. The performance of the developed acquisition system has been evaluated in terms of the power spectral density and the H/V peaks by comparison with the results obtained through a commercial seismic recorder. The obtained results show the applicability of the developed acquisition system to record seismic noise and to apply the H/V method.

Another interesting property of the proposed antenna is its simplicity of construction. The antenna has been modelled using the moment method. A prototype resonant at 2.4GHz has been built and we have measured its impedance in this spectral region. The radiation pattern and the gain at resonance have also been characterized and the device has been shown to provide 6.31 dBi gain.

The complex inner geometry of conventional slot dies require expensive machining that limits accessibility and experimentation. In order to overcome these issues this study follows an open hardware approach, which uses an open source 3-D printer to both fabricate the slot die and then to functionalize a 3-D slot die printing system. Polymer materials are tested and selected for compatibility with common solvents and used to fabricate a custom slot die head. This slot die is then integrated into a 3-D printer augmented with a syringe pump to form an additive manufacturing platform for thin film semiconductor devices. The full design of the slot die system is disclosed here using an open source license including software and operational protocols. This study demonstrates that functional lab-grade slot dies may be 3-D printed using low-cost open source hardware methods A case study using NiO2 found an RMS value 0.486 nm, thickness of 17–49 nm, and a maximum optical transmission of 99.1%, which shows this additive manufacturing approach to slot die depositions as well of fabrication is capable of producing viable layers of advanced electronic materials.

Furthermore, an architecture for AAL must be capable to manage distributed application scenarios in order to support elderly people in all situations of their everyday life. This encompasses not just life at home but in particular the mobility of elderly people (e.g. when going for a walk or having sports) as well. Within this paper we will introduce a novel architecture for distributed AAL solutions whose design follows a modern Microservices approach by providing small core services instead of a monolithic application framework. The architecture comprises core services for sensor integration, and service discovery while supporting several communication models (periodic, sporadic, streaming). We extend the state-of-the-art by introducing a fault-tolerance model for our architecture on the basis of a fault-hypothesis describing the fault-containment regions (FCRs) with their respective failure modes and failure rates in order to support safety-critical AAL applications.","2018-04-01","2019-09-04 12:15:22","2019-09-04 12:15:22","2019-09-04 12:15:22","236-247","","","95","","Computers in Biology and Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/PTXX8HC5/Schmidt and Obermaisser - 2018 - Adaptive and technology-independent architecture f.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/XQWVZYLW/S0010482517303621.html","","","Advanced linux traffic control; Ambient assisted living; Fault-tolerance; IEEE 11073; Living lab; Microservices; Service discovery; Time synchronization; Traffic policing; Traffic shaping","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is due to the ability to deposit a small amount of material in precisely defined position. In the field of Biofabrication, inkjet printers are used to build 2D and 3D scaffolds and gels with biological molecules, including living cells. Several works, including seminal papers on inkjet bioprinting, were carried out with modified office printers. These printers have fixed structural characteristics and operating size, especially on the print-head, limiting the range of materials that can be dispensed. The aim of the present work is the design and fabrication of an open-source piezoelectric inkjet print-head, optimized for the bioprinting field. This low-cost, reproducible, reliable, versatile and biocompatible device will enable various research laboratories to work with a shared device; the open source allowing for parts to be modified to suit specific needs. The design was carried out by Finite Element (FE) modelling of the piezoelectric, mechanical, fluid dynamics and their coupling. The design was optimized for shear rate, which we minimized in order to be able to print cells. The mechanical frame of the printer was designed and built using a low-cost 3D printer. The nozzle plate was fabricated from a polycarbonate disc coated with biocompatible silicone, to increase the hydrophobicity of the outer surface of the disc, preventing ink adhesion on the edge of the nozzle; the refilling system, and the electronic control were also part of the project and will be freely available to download. The FE models were validated with ad-hoc experiments, printing water, gelatin solution, and cell culture media, by modulating the wave power in amplitude, frequency and duty cycle. The tests showed a large working window both respect to viscosity and to surface tension. Finally Human Skin Fibroblasts (ATCC-CRL- 2522, Teddington UK), suspended in culture media, were printed. Cell viability, assessed by CellTiter-Blue and LIVE / DEAD tests, resulted comparable with the control, demonstrating the validity of the first open source piezoelectric inkjet print-head for biofabrication.","2015-01-01","2019-09-04 12:14:35","2019-09-04 12:14:35","2019-09-04 12:14:35","98-105","","","110","","Procedia Engineering","","4th International Conference on Tissue Engineering, ICTE2015, An ECCOMAS Thematic Conference","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/98NQ3Y9M/De Maria et al. - 2015 - Design and Validation of an Open-Hardware Print-He.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/ZQMWBTN3/S1877705815012564.html","","","Bioprinting; Inkjet; Opensource.; Piezoelectric","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It was shown that electrically stimulating the brain can be used to produce simple visual impressions of light blobs (phosphenes). This technology, using electrodes placed on top of the visual cortex, was successfully used to give blind people some degree of visual impression of their surrounding. However, this perception is very far away from natural sight. For developing the next generation of visual prostheses, real-time closed-loop stimulators are required. Such a stimulator measures the actual neuronal activities and on this basis determines the required stimulation pattern. In addition, there is a desire to shrink the diameter of the applied electrodes and increase their spatial density. This leads to the challenge of designing a system that can produce arbitrary stimulation-patterns with up to ±70 V and with up to 25 mA while measuring neuronal signals with amplitudes in the order of mV. Furthermore, interruptions of the measurements during stimulation should be as short as possible and the system needs to scale to hundreds of electrodes. We discuss how such a system and especially its current pumps and input protection need to be designed and which problems arise. We condense our findings into an example design for which we provide all design files (boards, firmwares and software) as open-source. This is a first step in taking the existing open-sourcewww.open-ephys.org recording system and converting it into a closed-loop experimental setup for neuro-prosthetic research.","2019-10-01","2019-09-04 12:10:40","2019-09-04 12:10:40","2019-09-04 12:10:40","e00078","","","6","","HardwareX","Open Hardware for neuro-prosthesis research","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/JHALG3IJ/Rotermund et al. - 2019 - Open Hardware for neuro-prosthesis research A stu.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/Q2VZHTIY/S2468067218301202.html","","","Closed-loop experiments; ECoG; Electrical stimulation; Neuro-implant; Neuro-prosthetics; Open Hardware; Visual cortex prosthesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are significant challenges associated with building such technologies, not least those required for investigating dynamic processes such as embryonic development, during which high rates of temporal, spatial, and functional change are inherently difficult to capture. Here, we present EmbryoPhenomics, an accessible high-throughput platform for phenomics in aquatic embryos comprising an Open-source Video Microscope (OpenVIM) that produces high-resolution videos of multiple embryos under tightly controlled environmental conditions. These videos are then analysed by the Python package Embryo Computer Vision (EmbryoCV), which extracts phenomic data for morphological, physiological, behavioural, and proxy traits during the process of embryonic development. We demonstrate the broad-scale applicability of EmbryoPhenomics in a series of experiments assessing chronic, acute, and multistressor responses to environmental change (temperature and salinity) in >30 million images of >600 embryos of two species with markedly different patterns of development—the pond snail Radix balthica and the marine amphipod Orchestia gammarellus. The challenge of phenomics is significant but so too are the rewards, and it is particularly relevant to the urgent task of assessing complex organismal responses to current rates of environmental change. EmbryoPhenomics can acquire and process data capturing functional, temporal, and spatial responses in the earliest, most dynamic life stages and is potentially game changing for those interested in studying development and phenomics more widely.","2018-12-13","2019-09-04 07:08:34","2019-12-02 10:40:59","2019-09-04 07:08:34","e3000074","","12","16","","PLOS Biology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/TSSQEMTV/Tills et al. - 2018 - A high-throughput and open-source platform for emb.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/MDVR5LXE/Tills et al. - 2018 - A high-throughput and open-source platform for emb.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/XZ9GLFG9/article.html; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/4XAREQR3/article.html","","","Computer vision; Data acquisition; Embryos; Heart; Heart rate; Image analysis; Salinity; Video microscopy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studying root architecture and the dynamic changes that occur during a plant’s lifespan, especially for perennial crops growing over multiple growing seasons, is still a challenge because of the nature of their growing environment in soil. We describe the utility of an imaging platform called RhizoVision Crown to study RSA of alfalfa, a perennial forage crop affected by Phymatotrichopsis Root Rot (PRR) disease. <i>Phymatotrichopsis omnivora</i> is the causal agent of PRR disease that reduces alfalfa stand longevity. During the lifetime of the stand, PRR disease rings enlarge and the field can be categorized into three zones based upon plant status: asymptomatic, disease front and survivor. To study root architectural changes associated with PRR, a four-year old 25.6-hectare alfalfa stand infested with PRR was selected at the Red River Farm, Burneyville, OK during October 2017. Line transect sampling was conducted from four actively growing PRR disease rings. At each disease ring, six line transects were positioned spanning 15 m on either side of the disease front with one alfalfa root sampled at every 3 m interval. Each alfalfa root was imaged with the RhizoVision Crown platform using a backlight and a high-resolution monochrome CMOS camera enabling preservation of the natural root architectural integrity. The platform’s image analysis software, RhizoVision Analyzer, automatically segmented images, skeletonized, and extracted a suite of features. Data indicated that the survivor plants compensated for damage or loss to the taproot through the development of more lateral and crown roots, and that a suite of multivariate features could be used to automatically classify roots as from survivor or asymptomatic zones. Root growth is a dynamic process adapting to ever changing interactions among various phytobiome components, by utilizing a low-cost, efficient and high-throughput Rhizo-Vision Crown platform we showed quantification of these changes occurring in a mature perennial forage crop.</p>","2018-12-23","2019-09-03 19:30:20","2019-12-02 10:49:01","2019-09-04 06:48:22","505321","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2018, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

However, current <i>in vitro</i> methods typically do not allow for precise, dynamic, spatiotemporal control of morphogen signaling and are thus insufficient to readily study how morphogen dynamics impact cell behavior. Here we show that optogenetic Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation can be controlled at user-defined intensities, temporal sequences, and spatial patterns using novel engineered illumination devices for optogenetic photostimulation and light activation at variable amplitudes (LAVA). The optical design of LAVA devices was optimized for uniform illumination of multi-well cell culture plates to enable high-throughput, spatiotemporal optogenetic activation of signaling pathways and protein-protein interactions. Using the LAVA devices, variation in light intensity induced a dose-dependent response in optoWnt activation and downstream Brachyury expression in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Furthermore, time-varying and spatially localized patterns of light revealed tissue patterning that models embryonic presentation of Wnt signals <i>in vitro</i>. The engineered LAVA devices thus provide a low-cost, user-friendly method for high-throughput and spatiotemporal optogenetic control of cell signaling for applications in developmental and cell biology.</p>","2019-06-19","2019-09-03 19:28:46","2019-09-03 19:28:46","2019-09-03 19:28:46","675892","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2019, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

We developed a set of genetic components (e.g. promoters, coding sequences, terminators) and vectors following the standard framework of Golden Gate, which allowed the fabrication of genetic constructs in a combinatorial, low cost and robust manner. In order to provide simultaneous imaging of multiple wavelength signals, we screened a series of long stokes shift fluorescent proteins that could be combined with cyan/green fluorescent proteins. We found CyOFP1, mBeRFP and sfGFP to be the most compatible set for 3-channel fluorescent imaging. We developed open source Python code to operate the hardware to run time-lapse experiments with automated control of illumination and camera and a Python module to analyze data and extract meaningful biological information. To demonstrate the potential application of this integral system, we tested its performance on a diverse range of imaging assays often used in disciplines such as microbial ecology, microbiology and synthetic biology. We also assessed its potential for STEM teaching in a high school environment, using it to teach biology, hardware design, optics, and programming. Together, these results demonstrate the successful integration of open source hardware, software, genetic resources and customizable manufacturing to obtain a powerful, low cost and robust system for STEM education, scientific research and bioengineering.

It was shown that electrically stimulating the brain can be used to produce simple visual impressions of light blobs (phosphenes). However, this perception is very far away from natural sight. For developing the next generation of visual prostheses, real-time closed-loop stimulators which measure the actual neuronal activities and on this basis determine the required stimulation pattern. This leads to the challenge to design a system that can produce arbitrary stimulation-patterns with up to ±70V and with up to 25mA while measuring neuronal signals with amplitudes in the order of mV. Furthermore, the interruption of the measurement by stimulation must be as short as possible and the system needs to scale to hundreds of electrodes. We discuss how such a system and especially its current pumps and input protection need to be designed and which problems arise. We condense our findings into an example design for which we provide all design files (boards, firmwares and software) as open-source.

However, entering this field of research is difficult since such an implant requires components from many different areas of technology. Since the complete avoidance of wires is important due to the risk of infections and other long-term problems, means for wireless transmitting data and energy are a necessity which adds to the requirements. In recent literature many high-tech components for such implants are presented with remarkable properties. However, these components are typically not freely available for your system. Every group needs to re-develop their own solution. This raises the question if it is possible to create a reusable design for an implant and its external base-station, such that it allows other groups to use it as a starting point. In this article we try to answer this question by presenting a design based exclusively on commercial off-the-shelf components and studying the properties of the resulting system.

Real-time monitoring of stomatal dynamics can be used for predicting the plant hydraulics, photosensitivity, and gas exchanges effectively. To date, several techniques offer the direct or indirect measurement of stomatal dynamics, yet none offer real-time, long-term persistent measurement of multiple stomal apertures simultaneously of an intact leaf in a field under natural conditions. Here, we report a high-resolution portable microscope-based technique for <i>in situ</i> real-time field imaging and monitoring of stomata. Our technique is capable of analyzing and quantifying the multiple lower epidermis stomal pore dynamics simultaneously and does not require any physical or chemical manipulation of a leaf. An upward facing objective lens in our portable microscope allows the imaging of lower epidermis stomatal opening of a leaf while upper epidermis being exposed to the natural environment. Small depth of field (~ 1.3 μm) of a high-magnifying objection lens assists in focusing the stomatal plane in highly non-planar tomato leaf having a high density of trichome (hair-like structures). For long-term monitoring, the leaf is fixed mechanically by a novel designed leaf holder providing freedom to expose the upper epidermis to the sunlight and lower epidermis to the wind simultaneously. In our study, a direct relation between the stomatal opening and the intensity of sunlight illuminating on the upper epidermis has been observed in real-time. In addition, real-time porosity of leaf (ratio between the areas of stomatal opening to the area of a leaf) and stomatal aspect ratio (ratio between the major axis and minor axis of stomatal opening) along with stomatal density have been quantified.</p>","2019-06-21","2019-09-03 18:25:38","2019-09-03 18:25:38","2019-09-03 18:25:38","677450","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2019, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

Particularly in mice, it is frequently used to characterize the visual performance of different genetically modified strains or to test the effect of various drugs on visual performance. Several methods have been developed to facilitate the presentation of stimuli using computer screens or projectors. Common methods are either based on the measurement of eye movement during optokinetic reflex behavior or rely on the measurement of head and/or body-movements during optomotor responses. Eye-movements can easily and objectively be quantified, but their measurement requires invasive fixation of the animals. Head movements can be observed in freely moving animals, but until now depended on the judgment of a human observer who reported the counted tracking movements of the animal during an experiment. In this study we present a novel measurement and stimulation system based on open source building plans and software. This system presents appropriate 360 stimuli while simultaneously video-tracking the animal's head-movements without fixation. The on-line determined head gaze is used to adjust the stimulus to the head position, as well as to automatically calculate visual acuity.

Thus the field is poised to benefit from automation, just as molecular biology did from liquid-handling robots. We developed a Modular Automated Platform for Large-scale Experiments (MAPLE), a <i>Drosophila-handling</i> robot capable of conducting lab tasks and experiments. We demonstrate MAPLE’s ability to accelerate the collection of virgin female flies (a pervasive experimental chore in fly genetics) and assist high-throughput phenotyping assays. Using MAPLE to autonomously run a novel social interaction experiment, we found that 1) pairs of flies exhibit persistent idiosyncrasies in affiliative behavior, 2) these dyad-specific interactions require olfactory and visual cues, and 3) social interaction network structure is topologically stable over time. These diverse examples demonstrate MAPLE’s versatility as a general platform for conducting fly science automatically.</p>","2017-12-24","2019-09-03 18:21:17","2019-09-03 18:21:17","2019-09-03 18:21:17","239459","","","","","","MAPLE","","","","","","","en","© 2017, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

To investigate the underlying neuronal correlates of natural behavior, it is useful to have access to state-of-the-art recording equipment (e.g., 2-photon imaging, patch recordings, etc.) that frequently requires head fixation. This limitation has been addressed with various approaches such as virtual reality/air ball or treadmill systems. However, achieving multimodal realistic behavior in these systems can be challenging. These systems are often also complex and expensive to implement. Here we present “Air-Track,” an easy-to-build head-fixed behavioral environment that requires only minimal computational processing. The Air-Track is a lightweight physical maze floating on an air table that has all the properties of the “real” world, including multiple sensory modalities tightly coupled to motor actions. To test this system, we trained mice in Go/No-Go and two-alternative forced choice tasks in a plus maze. Mice chose lanes and discriminated apertures or textures by moving the Air-Track back and forth and rotating it around themselves. Mice rapidly adapted to moving the track and used visual, auditory, and tactile cues to guide them in performing the tasks. A custom-controlled camera system monitored animal location and generated data that could be used to calculate reaction times in the visual and somatosensory discrimination tasks. We conclude that the Air-Track system is ideal for eliciting natural behavior in concert with virtually any system for monitoring or manipulating brain activity.","2016-07-13","2019-09-03 18:21:04","2019-09-03 18:21:04","2019-09-03 18:21:04","1542-1553","","4","116","","Journal of Neurophysiology","Air-Track","","","","","","","","","","","","physiology.org (Atypon)","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/Q4J7DRWU/Nashaat et al. - 2016 - Air-Track a real-world floating environment for a.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/992G3262/jn.00088.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We developed a skilled lever positioning task that mice can perform within their home cage. The task requires mice to use their forelimb to precisely hold a lever mounted on a rotary encoder within a rewarded position to dispense a water reward. A Raspberry Pi microcomputer is used to record lever position during trials and to control task parameters, thus making this low-footprint apparatus ideal for use within animal housing facilities. Custom Python software automatically increments task difficulty by requiring a longer hold duration, or a more accurate hold position, to dispense a reward. The performance of individual animals within group-housed mice is tracked through radio-frequency identification implants, and data stored on the microcomputer may be accessed remotely through an active internet connection. Mice continuously engage in the task for over 2.5 mo and perform ~500 trials/24 h. Mice required ~15,000 trials to learn to hold the lever within a 10° range for 1.5 s and were able to further refine movement accuracy by limiting their error to a 5° range within each trial. These results demonstrate the feasibility of autonomously training group-housed mice on a forelimb motor task. This paradigm may be used in the future to assess functional recovery after injury or cortical reorganization induced by self-directed motor learning.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We developed a low-cost system for fully autonomous training of group-housed mice on a forelimb motor task.

Currently, the analysis of USV data is performed manually, and thus is time consuming. New method The goal of the present study was to develop a method for automated USV recognition using a ‘template detection’ procedure for vocalizations in the 50-kHz range (35–80kHz). The detector is designed to run within XBAT, a MATLAB graphical user interface and extensible bioacoustics tool developed at Cornell University. Results Results show that this method is capable of detecting >90% of emitted USVs and that time spent analyzing data by experimenters is greatly reduced. Comparison with existing methods Currently, no viable and publicly available methods exist for the automated detection of USVs. The present method, in combination with the XBAT environment is ideal for the USV community as it allows others to (1) detect USVs within a user-friendly environment, (2) make improvements to the detector and disseminate and (3) develop new tools for analysis within the MATLAB environment. Conclusions The present detector provides an open-source, accurate method for the detection of 50-kHz USVs. Ongoing research will extend the current method for use in the 22-kHz frequency range of ultrasonic vocalizations. Moreover, collaborative efforts among USV researchers may enhance the capabilities of the current detector via changes to the templates and the development of new programs for analysis.","2014-10-30","2019-09-03 18:19:12","2019-09-03 18:19:12","2019-09-03 18:19:12","68-75","","","236","","Journal of Neuroscience Methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/36TE66TL/Barker et al. - 2014 - Automated detection of 50-kHz ultrasonic vocalizat.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/CZVLPPKR/S016502701400291X.html","","","Affect; Automatic detection; MATLAB; Open-source; Ultrasonic vocalizations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the whisker system, we tested for a shared code based on localized whisker micromotions (stick-slips) and slip-evoked spikes. We trained mice to discriminate smooth from rough surfaces, including ridged gratings and sandpaper. Whisker slips locked to ridges and evoked temporally precise spikes (<10 ms jitter) in somatosensory cortex (S1) that could resolve ridges with ∼1 mm accuracy. Slip-sensitive neurons also encoded touch and texture. On rough surfaces, both slip-evoked spikes and an additional non-slip signal elevated mean firing rate, allowing accurate rough-smooth texture decoding from population firing rate. Eighteen percent of neurons were selective among rough surfaces.

The cost for building this feeder is less than €200 and we have successfully tested our design with three different food types for pigeons, cats, and marmoset monkeys.","2017-04-01","2019-09-03 17:16:12","2019-12-02 10:41:18","2019-09-03 18:10:08","13-21","","","1","","HardwareX","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/6AWPQT99/Oh et al. - 2017 - An open source automatic feeder for animal experim.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/7H4M97YE/Oh et al. - 2017 - An open source automatic feeder for animal experim.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/HGKZLH8W/S2468067216300050.html; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/LEHB4RRK/S2468067216300050.html","","","Open source hardware; Animal experiments; Automatic feeder; Operant conditioning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we discuss how to set up an Arduino and Python based platform system to control a Go/No-Go sensory behavior paradigm. Using an Arduino micro-controller and python-based custom written program, a reward can be delivered to the animal depending on the decision reported. We discuss the various components required to build the behavioral apparatus that can control and report such a sensory stimulus paradigm.

At the same time, firms need to retain exclusive control over some essential components to capture value from their product and/or service system. This paper contributes to the literature by analyzing some of the trade-offs between openness to external value creation and closedness for internal value capture. It focuses on selective openness as a key variable and investigates how it affects value creation by external complementors, specifically the members of user innovation communities. Openness, it is hypothesized, matters to community members: The more open a product design is, the higher their sense of involvement in the innovation project, and the larger the effort they devote to it. Unlike prior literature, different forms and loci of openness are distinguished, specifically the transparency, accessibility, and replicability of different components of the product being developed. Hypotheses are tested based on survey data (n = 309) from 20 online communities in the consumer electronics and information technology hardware industries. Multilevel regression analysis is used to account for clustering, and thus nonindependent data, at the community level. We find that openness indeed increases community members’ involvement in the innovation project and their contributions to it. Interestingly, however, some forms and loci of openness strongly affect community perceptions and behavior, while others have limited or no impact. This finding suggests that, at least in relation to user communities, the trade-off that firms face between external value creation and internal value capture is softer than hitherto understood. Contingency factors that may be able to explain these patterns are advanced. For example, users are expected to value the form of openness that they have the capabilities and incentives to exploit. The findings in this paper extend the literature on selective openness in innovation. They emphasize the need to study the demand for different forms of openness at the subsystem level and align supply-side strategies to it. In managerial practice, a careful assessment of the demand for openness enables firms to successfully use selective openness and to effectively appropriate value from selectively open systems.","2014-03-01","2018-08-17 15:23:26","2018-08-17 15:23:26","2018-08-17 15:23:26","392-407","","2","31","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2013 Product Development & Management Association","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/U3LMCABG/Balka et al. - 2014 - The Effect of Selective Openness on Value Creation.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/BXLCNDRX/jpim.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This tradeoff is acutely felt for diagnostic applications, where the speed and cost of image-based diagnosis is related to the area of the sample that can be viewed at sufficient resolution. Here we present a simple and low-cost approach to mobile phone microscopy that uses a reversed mobile phone camera lens added to an intact mobile phone to enable high quality imaging over a significantly larger field of view than standard microscopy.

Due to its reliance on trained microscopists, field microscopy often suffers from poor sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility. The goal of this work, called the Autoscope, is a low-cost automated digital microscope coupled with a set of computer vision and classification algorithms, which can accurately diagnose of a variety of infectious diseases, targeting use-cases in the developing world. Our initial target is malaria, because of the high difficulty of the task and because manual microscopy is currently a central but highly imperfect tool for malaria work in the field. In addition to diagnosis, the algorithm performs species identification and quantitation of parasite load, parameters which are critical in many field applications but which are not effectively determined by rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). We have built a hardware prototype which can scan approximately 0.1 μL of blood volume in a standard Giemsa-stained thick smear blood slide in approximately 20 minutes. We have also developed a comprehensive machine learning framework, leveraging computer vision and machine learning techniques including support vector machines (SVMs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The Autoscope has undergone successful initial field testing for malaria diagnosis in Thailand.","2015-10","2016-02-26 10:15:44","2016-02-26 10:15:44","","393-399","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/N7IAIMDW/abs_all.html; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/BDW2XQV4/Delahunt et al. - 2015 - Automated microscopy and machine learning for expe.pdf","","","Autoscope; biomedical optical imaging; blood; blood volume; classification algorithms; comprehensive machine learning framework; computer vision; computer-aided diagnosis; convolutional neural networks; diseases; expert-level malaria field diagnosis; hardware prototype; image classification; Image color analysis; infectious disease diagnosis; learning (artificial intelligence); leveraging computer vision; low-cost automated digital microscope; machine learning; machine learning techniques; malaria; medical expert systems; medical image processing; Microscopy; neural nets; optical microscope; optical microscopy; parasite load; patient diagnosis; rapid diagnostic tests; species identification; species quantitation; standard Giemsastained thick smear blood slide; support vector machines; SVM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015 IEEE Global Humanitarian Technology Conference (GHTC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, higher animals possess the ability to adapt to certain environments (e.g. novel foraging grounds), and, therefore, those responses need to be plastic. Previous studies revealed a cell-type specific role of the endocannabinoid system in novelty fear, conditioned fear and active vs. passive avoidance in a shuttle box paradigm. In this study we aim to investigate, whether knocking-out the cannabinoid receptor type-1 (CB1) on cortical glutamatergic (Glu-CB1 -/- ) or GABAergic (GABA-CB1 -/- ) neurons differentially affects the level of behavioral inhibition, which could ultimately lead to differences in escape behavior. In this context, we developed a novel behavioral paradigm, the Moving Wall Box (MWB). Using the MWB task we could show that Glu-CB1 -/- mice have higher levels of behavioral inhibition over the course of repeated testing, GABA-CB1 -/- mice in contrast showed significantly lower levels of behavioral inhibition compared to wild-type controls and more escape behavior. These changes in behavioral inhibition and escape behavior cannot be explained by altered levels of arousal, as repeated startle measurements revealed general habituation irrespective of the genotype of the animals. Taken together, we could show that CB1 on cortical glutamatergic terminals is important for the acquisition of active avoidance, as the absence of CB1 on these neurons creates a bias towards inhibitory avoidance. This is the case in situations without punishment such as electric footshocks. On the contrary CB1 receptors on GABAergic neurons mediate the acquisition of passive avoidance, as the absence of CB1 on those neurons establishes a strong bias towards escape behavior.","2017","2019-09-03 18:04:43","2019-09-03 18:04:43","2019-09-03 18:04:43","","","","11","","Front.

In this system, a galvano-mirror modulates and cyclically couples the excitation light to individual multimode optical fiber bundles. A single photodetector collects excited light and the configuration of fiber bundle assembly and the scanner determines the total channel number. We demonstrated that the system exhibited negligible crosstalk between channels and optical signals could be sampled simultaneously with a sample rate of at least 100 Hz for each channel, which is sufficient for recording calcium signals. Using this system, we successfully recorded GCaMP6 fluorescent signals from the bilateral barrel cortices of a head-restrained mouse in a dual-channel mode, and the orbitofrontal cortices of multiple freely moving mice in a triple-channel mode.

The system supports five mice at a time and requires minimal investigator intervention. Using genetically encoded calcium indicator transgenic mice, we longitudinally monitor cortical functional connectivity up to 24 h per day in >7,000 self-initiated and unsupervised imaging sessions up to 90 days. The procedure provides robust assessment of functional cortical maps on the basis of both spontaneous activity and brief sensory stimuli such as light flashes. The approach is scalable to a number of remotely controlled cages that can be assessed within the controlled conditions of dedicated animal facilities. We anticipate that home-cage brain imaging will permit flexible and chronic assessment of mesoscale cortical function.,  Functional imaging in awake head-fixed mice is a widely used technique to study neural responses.

Fluorescence imaging through head-mounted microscopes in freely behaving animals is becoming a standard method to study neural circuit function. Flexible, open-source designs are needed to spur evolution of the method. Approach. We describe a miniature microscope for single-photon fluorescence imaging in freely behaving animals. The device is made from 3D printed parts and off-the-shelf components. These microscopes weigh less than 1.8 g, can be configured to image a variety of fluorophores, and can be used wirelessly or in conjunction with active commutators. Microscope control software, based in Swift for macOS, provides low-latency image processing capabilities for closed-loop, or BMI, experiments. Main results. Miniature microscopes were deployed in the songbird premotor region HVC (used as a proper name), in singing zebra finches. Individual neurons yield temporally precise patterns of calcium activity that are consistent over repeated renditions of song. Several cells were tracked over timescales of weeks and months, providing an opportunity to study learning related changes in HVC.

Neuronal firing is timed at millisecond precision. Therefore, to decipher temporal coding, it is necessary to monitor and control animal behavior at the same level of temporal accuracy. However, it is technically challenging to deliver sensory stimuli and reinforcers as well as to read the behavioral responses they elicit with millisecond precision. Presently available commercial systems often excel in specific aspects of behavior control, but they do not provide a customizable environment allowing flexible experimental design while maintaining high standards for temporal control necessary for interpreting neuronal activity. Moreover, delay measurements of stimulus and reinforcement delivery are largely unavailable. We combined microcontroller-based behavior control with a sound delivery system for playing complex acoustic stimuli, fast solenoid valves for precisely timed reinforcement delivery and a custom-built sound attenuated chamber using high-end industrial insulation materials. Together this setup provides a physical environment to train head-fixed animals, enables calibrated sound stimuli and precisely timed fluid and air puff presentation as reinforcers. We provide latency measurements for stimulus and reinforcement delivery and an algorithm to perform such measurements on other behavior control systems. Combined with electrophysiology and optogenetic manipulations, the millisecond timing accuracy will help interpret temporally precise neural signals and behavioral changes. Additionally, since software and hardware provided here can be readily customized to achieve a large variety of paradigms, these solutions enable an unusually flexible design of rodent behavioral experiments.","2018","2019-09-03 17:57:04","2019-09-03 17:57:04","2019-09-03 17:57:04","","","","12","","Front.

Such data are routinely collected using bench-top spectrophotometers or so-called plate readers. These equipments present several drawbacks: (<i>i</i>) measurements from different devices cannot be compared directly, (<i>ii</i>) proprietary nature of devices makes it difficult for standardisation methods to be developed across devices, and (<i>iii</i>) high costs limit access to devices, which can become a bottleneck for researchers, especially for those working with anaerobic organisms or at higher containment level laboratories. These limitations could be lifted, and data reproducibility improved, if the scientific community could adopt standardised, low-cost and open-source devices that can be built in-house. Here, we present such a device, MicrobeMeter, which is a do-it-yourself (DIY), simple, yet robust photometer with continuous data-logging capability. It is built using 3D-printing and open-source Arduino platform, combined with purpose-built electronic circuits. We show that MicrobeMeter displays linear relation between culture density and turbidity measurement for microbes from different phylogenetic domains. In addition, culture density estimated from MicrobeMeter measurements produced less variance compared against three commercial bench-top spectrophotometers, indicating that its measurements are less affected by the differences in cell types. We show the utility of MicrobeMeter, as a programmable wireless continuous measurement device, by collecting long-term growth dynamics up to 458 hours from aerobic and anaerobic cultures. We provide a full open-source description of MicrobeMeter and its implementation for faster adaptation and future development by the scientific community.

In recent years however there has been a move to adopt the technology as full-scale manufacturing solution. The advent of low-cost, desktop 3D printers such as the RepRap and Fab@Home has meant a wider user base are now able to have access to desktop manufacturing platforms enabling them to produce highly customised products for personal use and sale. This uptake in usage has been coupled with a demand for printing technology and materials able to print functional elements such as electronic sensors. Here we present formulation of a simple conductive thermoplastic composite we term ‘carbomorph’ and demonstrate how it can be used in an unmodified low-cost 3D printer to print electronic sensors able to sense mechanical flexing and capacitance changes. We show how this capability can be used to produce custom sensing devices and user interface devices along with printed objects with embedded sensing capability. This advance in low-cost 3D printing with offer a new paradigm in the 3D printing field with printed sensors and electronics embedded inside 3D printed objects in a single build process without requiring complex or expensive materials incorporating additives such as carbon nanotubes.","2012-11-21","2019-09-03 17:35:56","2019-09-03 17:35:56","2019-09-03 17:35:56","e49365","","11","7","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/54V8KENU/Leigh et al. - 2012 - A Simple, Low-Cost Conductive Composite Material f.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/3SGSQBHT/article.html","","","3D printing; Electronics; Capacitance; Composite materials; Electric conductivity; Polymers; Scanning electron microscopy; Thermoplastics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To assist in this aim, this paper introduces a library of open-source 3-D-printable optics components. This library operates as a flexible, low-cost public-domain tool set for developing both research and teaching optics hardware. First, the use of parametric open-source designs using an open-source computer aided design package is described to customize the optics hardware for any application. Second, details are provided on the use of open-source 3-D printers (additive layer manufacturing) to fabricate the primary mechanical components, which are then combined to construct complex optics-related devices. Third, the use of the open-source electronics prototyping platform are illustrated as control for optical experimental apparatuses. This study demonstrates an open-source optical library, which significantly reduces the costs associated with much optical equipment, while also enabling relatively easily adapted customizable designs. The cost reductions in general are over 97%, with some components representing only 1% of the current commercial investment for optical products of similar function.

The tractable size of the embryo offers considerable advantages for in toto imaging and quantitative analysis of morphogenesis. For functional studies, Ciona eggs are considerably more challenging to microinject than the much larger eggs of other model organisms such as zebrafish and Xenopus. One of the key difficulties is in restraining the eggs so that the microinjection needle can be easily introduced and withdrawn. Here we develop and test a device to cast wells in agarose that are each sized to hold a single egg. This injection mold is fabricated by micro-resolution stereolithography with a grid of egg-sized posts that cast corresponding wells in agarose. This 3D printing technology allows the rapid and inexpensive testing of iteratively refined prototypes.

Home-built multiphoton microscopes are easy to build, highly customizable, and cost effective. For many imaging applications a 3-axis motorized stage is critical, but commercially available motorization hardware (motorized translators, controller boxes, etc) are often very expensive. Furthermore, the firmware on commercial motor controllers cannot easily be altered and is not usually designed with a microscope stage in mind. Here we describe an open-source motorization solution that is simple to construct, yet far cheaper and more customizable than commercial offerings. The cost of the controller and motorization hardware are under $1000. Hardware costs are kept low by replacing linear actuators with high quality stepper motors. Electronics are assembled from commonly available hobby components, which are easy to work with. Here we describe assembly of the system and quantify the positioning accuracy of all three axes. We obtain positioning repeatability of the order of in X/Y and in Z. A hand-held control-pad allows the user to direct stage motion precisely over a wide range of speeds ( to ), rapidly store and return to different locations, and execute “jumps” of a fixed size.

Both applications rely heavily on the consistent, accurate calibration of imaging gradients, yet such calibrations are typically only performed during maintenance sessions by equipment manufacturers, and potentially with acceptance limits that are inadequate for phenotyping. To overcome this difficulty, we present a protocol for gradient calibration quality assurance testing, based on a 3D-printed, open source, structural phantom that can be customised to the dimensions of individual scanners and RF coils. In trials on a 9.4 T system, the gradient scaling errors were reduced by an order of magnitude, and displacements of greater than 100 µm, caused by gradient non-linearity, were corrected using a post-processing technique. The step-by-step protocol can be integrated into routine pre-clinical MRI quality assurance to measure and correct for these errors.

In practice though, commonly used flat boluses fail to make a perfect contact with the irregular surface of the patient’s skin, resulting in air gaps. Hence, we fabricated a customized bolus using a 3-dimensional (3D) printer and evaluated its feasibility for radiotherapy. Methods We designed two kinds of bolus for production on a 3D printer, one of which was the 3D printed flat bolus for the Blue water phantom and the other was a 3D printed customized bolus for the RANDO phantom. The 3D printed flat bolus was fabricated to verify its physical quality. The resulting 3D printed flat bolus was evaluated by assessing dosimetric parameters such as D1.5 cm, D5 cm, and D10 cm. The 3D printed customized bolus was then fabricated, and its quality and clinical feasibility were evaluated by visual inspection and by assessing dosimetric parameters such as Dmax, Dmin, Dmean, D90%, and V90%. Results The dosimetric parameters of the resulting 3D printed flat bolus showed that it was a useful dose escalating material, equivalent to a commercially available flat bolus. Analysis of the dosimetric parameters of the 3D printed customized bolus demonstrated that it is provided good dose escalation and good contact with the irregular surface of the RANDO phantom.

However, in most countries, the number of people willing to donate their body is low. A 3D printed model could be an alternative method for morphology research, but the accuracy of the morphology of a 3D printed model has not been determined. Methods Forty-five computed tomography (CT) scans of cervical, thoracic and lumbar spines were obtained, and 44 parameters of the cervical spine, 120 parameters of the thoracic spine, and 50 parameters of the lumbar spine were measured. The CT scan data in DICOM format were imported into Mimics software v10.01 for 3D reconstruction, and the data were saved in .STL format and imported to Cura software. After a 3D digital model was formed, it was saved in Gcode format and exported to a 3D printer for printing. After the 3D printed models were obtained, the above-referenced parameters were measured again. Results Paired t-tests were used to determine the significance, set to P<0.05, of all parameter data from the radiographic images and 3D printed models. Furthermore, 88.6% of all parameters of the cervical spine, 90% of all parameters of the thoracic spine, and 94% of all parameters of the lumbar spine had Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) values >0.800. The other ICC values were <0.800 and >0.600; none were <0.600. Conclusion In this study, we provide a protocol for printing accurate 3D spinal models for surgeons and researchers. The resulting 3D printed model is inexpensive and easily obtained for spinal fixation research.","2015-04-27","2019-09-03 17:29:56","2019-09-03 17:29:56","2019-09-03 17:29:56","e0124291","","4","10","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/4DLGAEL8/Wu et al. - 2015 - The Accuracy of a Method for Printing Three-Dimens.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/DAR5KPLF/article.html","","","3D printing; Imaging techniques; Lasers; Computed axial tomography; Digital imaging; Religion; Spine; Surgeons","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A key mechanical element in AUC is the centerpiece, a component of the sample cell assembly that is mounted between the optical windows to allow imaging and to seal the sample solution column against high vacuum while exposed to gravitational forces in excess of 300,000 g. For sedimentation velocity it needs to be precisely sector-shaped to allow unimpeded radial macromolecular migration. During the history of AUC a great variety of centerpiece designs have been developed for different types of experiments. Here, we report that centerpieces can now be readily fabricated by 3D printing at low cost, from a variety of materials, and with customized designs. The new centerpieces can exhibit sufficient mechanical stability to withstand the gravitational forces at the highest rotor speeds and be sufficiently precise for sedimentation equilibrium and sedimentation velocity experiments. Sedimentation velocity experiments with bovine serum albumin as a reference molecule in 3D printed centerpieces with standard double-sector design result in sedimentation boundaries virtually indistinguishable from those in commercial double-sector epoxy centerpieces, with sedimentation coefficients well within the range of published values. The statistical error of the measurement is slightly above that obtained with commercial epoxy, but still below 1%. Facilitated by modern open-source design and fabrication paradigms, we believe 3D printed centerpieces and AUC accessories can spawn a variety of improvements in AUC experimental design, efficiency and resource allocation.","2016-02-23","2019-09-03 17:24:07","2019-12-02 10:39:53","2019-09-03 17:24:07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 1602.07181","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/ETKZEMUP/Desai et al. - 2016 - 3D-Printing for Analytical Ultracentrifugation.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/HE4K9S3Q/1602.html","","","Quantitative Biology - Quantitative Methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, many hurdles still exist before these techniques can be used in research laboratories for cellular and molecular biology applications. Extrusion-based bioprinting systems have been characterized by high development costs, injector clogging, difficulty achieving small cell number deposits, decreased cell viability, and altered cell function post-printing. To circumvent the high-price barrier to entry of conventional bioprinters, we designed and 3D printed components for the adaptation of an inexpensive ‘off-the-shelf’ commercially available 3D printer. We also demonstrate via goal based computer simulations that the needle geometries of conventional commercially standardized, ‘luer-lock’ syringe-needle systems cause many of the issues plaguing conventional bioprinters. To address these performance limitations we optimized flow within several microneedle geometries, which revealed a short tapered injector design with minimal cylindrical needle length was ideal to minimize cell strain and accretion. We then experimentally quantified these geometries using pulled glass microcapillary pipettes and our modified, low-cost 3D printer. This systems performance validated our models exhibiting: reduced clogging, single cell print resolution, and maintenance of cell viability without the use of a sacrificial vehicle. Using this system we show the successful printing of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into Geltrex and note their retention of a pluripotent state 7 d post printing. We also show embryoid body differentiation of hiPSC by injection into differentiation conducive environments, wherein we observed continuous growth, emergence of various evaginations, and post-printing gene expression indicative of the presence of all three germ layers. These data demonstrate an accessible open-source 3D bioprinter capable of serving the needs of any laboratory interested in 3D cellular interactions and tissue engineering.","2016-06","2019-09-03 17:23:24","2019-09-03 17:23:24","2019-09-03 17:23:24","025017","","2","8","","Biofabrication","Accessible bioprinting","","","","","","","en","","","","","Institute of Physics","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/AV22VWCQ/Reid et al. - 2016 - Accessible bioprinting adaptation of a low-cost 3.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because molecular diagnostic methods are generally rather difficult to perform manually without highly trained users, automated and integrated systems are highly desirable but too costly for use at point-of-care or low-resource settings. Here, we showcase the development of a low-cost and rapid nucleic acid isolation and amplification platform by modifying entry-level 3D printers that cost between $400 and $750. Our modifications consisted of replacing the extruder with a tip-comb attachment that houses magnets to conduct magnetic particle-based nucleic acid extraction. We then programmed the 3D printer to conduct motions that can perform high-quality extraction protocols. Up to 12 samples can be processed simultaneously in under 13 minutes and the efficiency of nucleic acid isolation matches well against gold-standard spin-column-based extraction technology. Additionally, we used the 3D printer’s heated bed to supply heat to perform water bath-based polymerase chain reactions (PCRs). Using another attachment to hold PCR tubes, the 3D printer was programmed to automate the process of shuttling PCR tubes between water baths. By eliminating the temperature ramping needed in most commercial thermal cyclers, the run time of a 35-cycle PCR protocol was shortened by 33%. This article demonstrates that for applications in resource-limited settings, expensive nucleic acid extraction devices and thermal cyclers that are used in many central laboratories can be potentially replaced by a device modified from inexpensive entry-level 3D printers.","2016-06-30","2019-09-03 17:22:57","2019-09-03 17:22:57","2019-09-03 17:22:57","e0158502","","6","11","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/67RZYNY9/Chan et al. - 2016 - Low-Cost 3D Printers Enable High-Quality and Autom.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/HJYSH3GP/article.html","","","3D printing; Aluminum; Bacillus subtilis; DNA extraction; Elution; Polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; Urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

New instruments are built from components that are drawn from a host of different disciplines and not designed to integrate together, and once built, an instrument typically performs a limited number of tasks and cannot be easily adapted for new applications. Consequently, the process of inventing new instruments is very inefficient, especially for researchers or clinicians in resource-limited settings. To improve this situation, we propose that a family of standardized multidisciplinary components is needed, a set of “building blocks” that perform a wide array of different tasks and are designed to integrate together. Using these components, scientists, engineers, and clinicians would be able to build custom instruments for their own unique needs quickly and easily. In this work we present the foundation of this set of components, a system we call Multifluidic Evolutionary Components (MECs). “Multifluidic” conveys the wide range of fluid volumes MECs operate upon (from nanoliters to milliliters and beyond); “multi” also reflects the multiple disciplines supported by the system (not only fluidics but also electronics, optics, and mechanics). “Evolutionary” refers to the design principles that enable the library of MEC parts to easily grow and adapt to new applications. Each MEC “building block” performs a fundamental function that is commonly found in biological or chemical instruments, functions like valving, pumping, mixing, controlling, and sensing. Each MEC also has a unique symbol linked to a physical definition, which enables instruments to be designed rapidly and efficiently using schematics. As a proof-of-concept, we use MECs to build a variety of instruments, including a fluidic routing and mixing system capable of manipulating fluid volumes over five orders of magnitude, an acid-base titration instrument suitable for use in schools, and a bioreactor suitable for maintaining and analyzing cell cultures in research and diagnostic applications. These are the first of many instruments that can be built by researchers, clinicians, and students using the MEC system.","2016-07-20","2019-09-03 17:21:44","2019-09-03 17:21:44","2019-09-03 17:21:44","e0158706","","7","11","","PLOS ONE","MECs","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/ZRNJXEKX/Hill et al. - 2016 - MECs Building Blocks for Creating Biological an.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/8YMEND68/article.html","","","Microfluidics; Electronics; Fluid flow; Fluidics; Fluids; Nanofluidics; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Yeast","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Amongst the main obstacles to the introduction of new cell biology concepts to students is their general lack of identification with most teaching methods. The introduction of elaborated figures, movies and animations to textbooks has given a tremendous contribution to the learning process and the search for novel teaching methods has been a central goal in cell biology education. Some specialized tools, however, are usually only available in advanced research centers or in institutions that are traditionally involved with the development of novel teaching/learning processes, and are far from becoming reality in the majority of life sciences schools. When combined with the known declining interest in science among young people, a critical scenario may result. This is especially important in the field of electron microscopy and associated techniques, methods that have greatly contributed to the current knowledge on the structure and function of different cell biology models but are rarely made accessible to most students. In this work, we propose a strategy to increase the engagement of students into the world of cell and structural biology by combining 3D electron microscopy techniques and 3D prototyping technology (3D printing) to generate 3D physical models that accurately and realistically reproduce a close-to-the native structure of the cell and serve as a tool for students and teachers outside the main centers. We introduce three strategies for 3D imaging, modeling and prototyping of cells and propose the establishment of a virtual platform where different digital models can be deposited by EM groups and subsequently downloaded and printed in different schools, universities, research centers and museums, thereby modernizing teaching of cell biology and increasing the accessibility to modern approaches in basic science.","2016-08-15","2019-09-03 17:20:43","2019-09-03 17:20:43","2019-09-03 17:20:43","e0161184","","8","11","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/74W4XCS9/Augusto et al. - 2016 - Virtual Reconstruction and Three-Dimensional Print.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/RQRB5AS3/article.html","","","3D printing; Prototypes; Human learning; Cell biology; Cellular structures and organelles; Electron microscopy; Neutrophils; Tomography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A key mechanical element in AUC is the centerpiece, a component of the sample cell assembly that is mounted between the optical windows to allow imaging and to seal the sample solution column against high vacuum while exposed to gravitational forces in excess of 300,000 g. For sedimentation velocity it needs to be precisely sector-shaped to allow unimpeded radial macromolecular migration. During the history of AUC a great variety of centerpiece designs have been developed for different types of experiments. Here, we report that centerpieces can now be readily fabricated by 3D printing at low cost, from a variety of materials, and with customized designs. The new centerpieces can exhibit sufficient mechanical stability to withstand the gravitational forces at the highest rotor speeds and be sufficiently precise for sedimentation equilibrium and sedimentation velocity experiments. Sedimentation velocity experiments with bovine serum albumin as a reference molecule in 3D printed centerpieces with standard double-sector design result in sedimentation boundaries virtually indistinguishable from those in commercial double-sector epoxy centerpieces, with sedimentation coefficients well within the range of published values. The statistical error of the measurement is slightly above that obtained with commercial epoxy, but still below 1%. Facilitated by modern open-source design and fabrication paradigms, we believe 3D printed centerpieces and AUC accessories can spawn a variety of improvements in AUC experimental design, efficiency and resource allocation.","2016-08-15","2019-09-03 17:20:17","2019-09-03 17:20:17","2019-09-03 17:20:17","e0155201","","8","11","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/YZP22XP8/Desai et al. - 2016 - 3D-Printing for Analytical Ultracentrifugation.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/XY3EC8GW/article.html","","","3D printing; Data acquisition; Acrylics; Macromolecules; Polycarbonates; Rotors; Sedimentation; Ultracentrifugation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The only other option is to buy needed equipment and experimental setups from specialized manufactures. The latter option is not feasible the departments in developing countries where funding for education and research is scarce and very limited as equipments from these manufactures are typically too expensive. In the past couple of years and with the advancement in prototyping tools like Arduino, and microcontroller development boards, more friendly programming languages, 3D printers, desktop CNC machines and easy to use CAD/CAM softwares the need for highly qualified technicians and expensive workshop equipment was then relaxed \cite{nature-flypi}. The availability of such affordable, and relatively easy to use tools had the effect of increasing the number of teachers and researchers willing to develop their own experimental setups\cite{polis-flypi}.

Here we describe a high-performance, low-cost, open hardware pressure ejection system (Openspritzer), which can be constructed from off the shelf components. When connected to a standard micro-pipette <i>via</i> suitable pneumatic tubing, the device is capable of delivering minute doses of reagents to a wide range of biological and chemical systems. In this work, we characterise the performance of the device and compare it to a popular commercial system using two-photon fluorescence microscopy. We found that Openspritzer provides the same level of control over delivered reagent dose as the commercial system. Next, we demonstrate the utility of Openspritzer in a series of standard neurobiological applications. First, we used Openspritzer to deliver precise amounts of the neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA to hippocampal neurons to elicit time- and dose-precise excitatory and inhibitory responses, respectively. Second, we used Openspritzer to deliver infectious viral and bacterial agents to living tissue. Viral transfection of hippocampal interneurons with channelrhodopsin allowed for the optogenetic manipulation of hippocampal circuitry with light. Finally, we successfully used Openspritzer to infect organotypic hippocampal slice cultures with fluorescent <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> bacilli. We anticipate that due to its high performance and low cost Openspritzer will be of interest to a broad range of researchers working in the life and physical sciences.</p>","2016-12-13","2019-09-03 17:13:36","2019-09-03 17:13:36","2019-09-03 17:13:36","093633","","","","","","Openspritzer","","","","","","","en","© 2016, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

Free and open source software and firmware are developed to operate the tool. The OS4PP was validated against a wide range of discrete resistors and indium tin oxide (ITO) samples of different thicknesses both pre- and post-annealing. The OS4PP was then compared to two commercial proprietary systems. Results of resistors from 10 to 1 MΩ show errors of less than 1% for the OS4PP. The 3-D mapping of sheet resistance of ITO samples successfully demonstrated the automated capability to measure non-uniformities in large-area samples. The results indicate that all measured values are within the same order of magnitude when compared to two proprietary measurement systems.

Methods Using CT thin slices data, we employed computer software to design the navigation template for pedicle screw fixation in the upper cervical spine (atlas and axis). The upper cervical spine models and navigation templates were produced by 3D printer with equal proportion, two sets for each case. In one set (Test group), pedicle screws fixation were guided by the navigation template; in the second set (Control group), the screws were fixed under fluoroscopy. According to the degree of pedicle cortex perforation and whether the screw needed to be refitted, the fixation effects were divided into 3 types: Type I, screw is fully located within the vertebral pedicle; Type II, degree of pedicle cortex perforation is <1 mm, but with good internal fixation stability and no need to renovate; Type III, degree of pedicle cortex perforation is >1 mm or with the poor internal fixation stability and in need of renovation. Type I and Type II were acceptable placements; Type III placements were unacceptable. Results A total of 19 upper cervical spine and 19 navigation templates were printed, and 37 pedicle screws were fixed in each group. Type I screw-placements in the test group totaled 32; Type II totaled 3; and Type III totaled 2; with an acceptable rate of 94.60%. Type I screw placements in the control group totaled 23; Type II totaled 3; and Type III totaled 11, with an acceptable rate of 70.27%. The acceptability rate in test group was higher than the rate in control group. The operation time and fluoroscopic frequency for each screw were decreased, compared with control group. Conclusion The individualized 3D printing navigation template for pedicle screw fixation is easy and safe, with a high success rate in the upper cervical spine surgery.","2017-02-02","2019-09-03 17:10:56","2019-09-03 17:10:56","2019-09-03 17:10:56","e0171509","","2","12","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/HNLTT9LB/Guo et al. - 2017 - Individualized 3D printing navigation template for.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/22VUPKBT/article.html","","","3D printing; Imaging techniques; Computed axial tomography; Spine; Software design; Computing methods; Surgical and invasive medical procedures; X-ray radiography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Entomologists have been progressing more toward using machine vision for efficiency for this endeavor. Digital methods have been used to study the behavior of insects in labs, for instance via three-dimensional tracking with specialized cameras to observe the reaction of mosquitoes towards human odor, heat and CO2, although virtually none was reported for several important fields, such as repellency studies which have a significant need for a proper response quantification. However, tracking mosquitoes individually is a challenge and only limited number of specimens can be studied. Although tracking large numbers of individual insects is hailed as one of the characteristics of an ideal automated image-based tracking system especially in 3D, it also is a costly method, often requiring specialized hardware and limited access to the algorithms used for mapping the specimens. The method proposed contributes towards (a) unlimited open source use, (b) a low-cost setup, (c) complete guide for any entomologist to adapt in terms of hardware and software, (d) simple to use, and (e) a lightweight data output for collective behavior analysis of mosquitoes. The setup is demonstrated by testing a simple response of mosquitoes in the presence of human odor versus control, one session with continuous human presence as a stimuli and the other with periodic presence. A group of female Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) mosquitoes are released into a white-background chamber with a transparent acrylic panel on one side. The video feed of the mosquitoes are processed using filtered contours in a threshold-adjustable video. The mosquitoes in the chamber are mapped on the raster where the coordinates of each mosquito are recorded with the corresponding timestamp. The average distance of the blobs within the frames against time forms a spectra where behavioral patterns can be observed directly, whether any collective effect is observed. With this method, 3D tracking will not be required and a more straightforward data output can be obtained.","2017-02-02","2019-09-03 17:10:42","2019-09-03 17:10:42","2019-09-03 17:10:42","e0171555","","2","12","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/47K3ALY6/Poh et al. - 2017 - Collective behavior quantification on human odor e.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/EEJIAXSB/article.html","","","Open source software; Behavior; Algorithms; Anopheles gambiae; Flight (biology); Insect flight; Insects; Mosquitoes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we present a low-cost ($110) syringe pressure pump that uses feedback control to regulate the pressure into microfluidic chips. Using an open-source microcontroller board (Arduino), we demonstrate an easily operated and programmable syringe pump that can be run using either a PID or bang-bang control method.

The developed 3D-printed spine QA phantom consisted of an acrylic body phantom and a 3D-printed spine shaped object. DLP and Polyjet 3D printers using a high-density acrylic polymer were employed to produce spine-shaped phantoms based on CT images. Image fusion was performed to evaluate the reproducibility of our phantom, and the Hounsfield units (HUs) were measured based on each CT image. Two different intensity-modulated radiotherapy plans based on both CT phantom image sets from the two printed spine-shaped phantoms with acrylic body phantoms were designed to deliver 16 Gy dose to the planning target volume (PTV) and were compared for target coverage and normal organ-sparing. Image fusion demonstrated good reproducibility of the developed phantom. The HU values of the DLP- and Polyjet-printed spine vertebrae differed by 54.3 on average. The PTV Dmax dose for the DLP-generated phantom was about 1.488 Gy higher than that for the Polyjet-generated phantom. The organs at risk received a lower dose for the 3D printed spine-shaped phantom image using the DLP technique than for the phantom image using the Polyjet technique. Despite using the same material for printing the spine-shaped phantom, these phantoms generated by different 3D printing techniques, DLP and Polyjet, showed different HU values and these differently appearing HU values according to the printing technique could be an extra consideration for developing the 3D printed spine-shaped phantom depending on the patient’s age and the density of the spinal bone. Therefore, the 3D printing technique and materials should be carefully chosen by taking into account the condition of the patient in order to accurately produce 3D printed patient-specific QA phantom.","2017-05-04","2019-09-03 17:02:49","2019-09-03 17:02:49","2019-09-03 17:02:49","e0176227","","5","12","","PLOS ONE","Characterization of 3D printing techniques","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/NARE8KF2/Kim et al. - 2017 - Characterization of 3D printing techniques Toward.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/CPRCL3QR/article.html","","","3D printing; Imaging techniques; Computed axial tomography; Radiation therapy; Spine; Acrylics; Spinal cord; Vertebrae","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Consequently, we fabricated a bolus using a 3D scanner and evaluated its efficacy. The head of an Alderson Rando phantom was scanned with a 3D scanner. The 3D surface data were exported and reconstructed with Geomagic Design X software. A 3D bolus of 5-mm thickness designed to fit onto the nose was printed with the use of rubber-like printing material, and a radiotherapy plan was developed. We successfully fabricated the customized 3D bolus, and further, a CT simulation indicated an acceptable fit of the 3D bolus to the nose. There was no air gap between the bolus and the phantom surface. The percent depth dose (PDD) curve of the phantom with the 3D bolus showed an enhanced surface dose when compared with that of the phantom without the bolus. The PDD of the 3D bolus was comparable with that of a commercial superflab bolus. The radiotherapy plan considering the 3D bolus showed improved target coverage when compared with that without the bolus.

However, due to the high-cost instrumentation involved and the complexity in maintenance, it is rarely used in the field to make a quick turnaround diagnosis. In order to provide a higher level of accessibility than current qPCR devices, a set of 3D manufacturing methods is explored as a possible option to fabricate a low-cost and portable qPCR device. The key advantage of this approach is the ability to upload the digital format of the design files on the internet for wide distribution so that people at any location can simply download and feed into their 3D printers for quick manufacturing. The material and design are carefully selected to minimize the number of custom parts that depend on advanced manufacturing processes which lower accessibility. The presented 3D manufactured qPCR device is tested with 20-μL samples that contain various concentrations of lentivirus, the same type as HIV. A reverse-transcription step is a part of the device’s operation, which takes place prior to the qPCR step to reverse transcribe the target RNA from the lentivirus into complementary DNA (cDNA). This is immediately followed by qPCR which quantifies the target sequence molecules in the sample during the PCR amplification process. The entire process of thermal control and time-coordinated fluorescence reading is automated by closed-loop feedback and a microcontroller. The resulting device is portable and battery-operated, with a size of 12 × 7 × 6 cm3 and mass of only 214 g. By uploading and sharing the design files online, the presented low-cost qPCR device may provide easier access to a robust diagnosis protocol for various infectious diseases, such as HIV and malaria.","2017-06-06","2019-09-03 16:56:58","2019-09-03 16:56:58","2019-09-03 16:56:58","e0179133","","6","12","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/6DZCW87B/Mulberry et al. - 2017 - 3D printing and milling a real-time PCR device for.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/9YZZSY27/article.html","","","3D printing; Microfluidics; Aluminum; Polymerase chain reaction; Convection; Diagnostic medicine; Medical devices and equipment; Photodiodes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With few exceptions, such test systems are discontinuous. They require exposure of the biological test material in small units, such as multiwell plates, during prolonged incubation periods, and do not allow online read-outs. It is mostly due to these shortcomings that applications in continuous monitoring of, e.g., drinking or surface water quality are largely missing. We propose the use of pipetting robots that can be used to automatically exchange samples in multiwell plates with fresh samples in a semi-static manner, as a potential solution to overcome these limitations. In this study, we developed a simple and low-cost, versatile pipetting robot constructed partly using open-source hardware that has a small footprint and can be used for online monitoring of water quality by means of an automated whole-organism bioassay. We tested its precision in automated 2-fold dilution series and used it for exposure of zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio)–a common model species in ecotoxicology—to cadmium chloride and permethrin. We found that, compared to conventional static or semi-static exposure scenarios, effects of the two chemicals in zebrafish embryos generally occurred at lower concentrations, and analytically verified that the increased frequency of media exchange resulted in a greater availability of the chemical.

Other key components include two acrylic cylinders, a rigid separator, a APL/membrane composite (APLMC) embedded PDMS membrane. In functional operation, the fluidic controller was driven to control the pressure difference and ALPMC deformation. The focal length can be changed through the pressure difference. This is achieved by the adjustment of volume change of injected liquid such that a widely tunable focal length. The proposed LAL can transform to 3 modes: microscopic mode (APLMC only), convex-concave mode and biconcave mode. It is noticeable that LAL in the operation of microscopic mode is tunable in focus via the actuation of APLMC (focal length is from 4.3 to 2.3 mm and magnification 50X) and can rival the images quality of commercial microscopes.

A high degree of spatial system integration and a graphical user interface provide user-friendly operability. The used optical density feedback control allows for constant continuous culture at a wide range of densities and offers to vary culture volume and dilution rates without additional parametrization. Further, a recursive algorithm for on-line growth rate estimation has been implemented. The employed Kalman filtering approach based on a very general state model retains the flexibility of the used control type and can be easily adapted to other bioreactor designs.

SCA is responsible for over 300,000 deaths per year both in Europe and in USA, and immediate clinical assistance through defibrillation is fundamental for recovery. In this context, an open-source approach can easily lead in improvements to the distribution and efficiency of AEDs. The proposed Open-Source AED (OAED) is composed of two separate electric boards: a high voltage board (HV-B), which contains the circuitry required to perform defibrillation and a control board (C-B), which detects SCA in the patient and controls the HV-B. Computer simulations and preliminary tests show that the OAED can release a 200J biphasic defibrillation in about 12s and detects SCA with sensitivity higher than 90% and specificity of about 99%.

The target application of the stimulator is to induce retinal degeneration in fly photoreceptor cells by exposing them to light in a controlled manner. The goal of this work is to obtain a reproducible system for studying age-related changes in susceptibility to environmental ocular stress. The stimulator uses light emitting diodes and an embedded computer to control illuminance, color (blue or red) and duration in two independent chambers. Further, the stimulator is equipped with per-chamber light and temperature sensors and a fan to monitor light intensity and to control temperature. An ON/OFF temperature control implemented on the embedded computer keeps the temperature from reaching levels that will induce the heat shock stress response in the flies. A custom enclosure was fabricated to house the electronic components of the stimulator. The enclosure provides a light-impermeable environment that allows air flow and lets users easily load and unload fly vials. Characterization results show that the fabricated stimulator can produce light at illuminances ranging from 0 to 16000 lux and power density levels from 0 to 7.2mW/cm2 for blue light. For red light the maximum illuminance is 8000 lux which corresponds to a power density of 3.54mW/cm2. The fans and the ON/OFF temperature control are able to keep the temperature inside the chambers below 28.17°C. Experiments with white-eye male flies were performed to assess the ability of the fabricated simulator to induce blue light-dependent retinal degeneration. Retinal degeneration is observed in flies exposed to 8h of blue light at 7949 lux. Flies in a control experiment with no light exposure show no retinal degeneration. Flies exposed to red light for the similar duration and light intensity (8h and 7994 lux) do not show retinal degeneration either. Hence, the fabricated stimulator can be used to create environmental ocular stress using blue light.","2017-10-01","2019-09-03 16:49:24","2019-09-03 16:49:24","2019-09-03 16:49:24","13-33","","","2","","HardwareX","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/ZPB4H6R4/Chen et al. - 2017 - A programmable optical stimulator for the Drosophi.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/QXDWYPYC/S246806721730024X.html","","","Open hardware; Light-emitting diodes; Drosophila; Embedded computers; Optical stimulation; Rhodopsin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The multi-fluorescence imaging system consists of readily available 470 nm LEDs, a Raspberry Pi camera and a set of filters made with low cost acrylics. This device allows imaging in scales ranging from single colonies to entire plates. We developed a set of genetic components (e.g. promoters, coding sequences, terminators) and vectors following the standard framework of Golden Gate, which allowed the fabrication of genetic constructs in a combinatorial, low cost and robust manner. In order to provide simultaneous imaging of multiple wavelength signals, we screened a series of long stokes shift fluorescent proteins that could be combined with cyan/green fluorescent proteins. We found CyOFP1, mBeRFP and sfGFP to be the most compatible set for 3-channel fluorescent imaging. We developed open source Python code to operate the hardware to run time-lapse experiments with automated control of illumination and camera and a Python module to analyze data and extract meaningful biological information. To demonstrate the potential application of this integral system, we tested its performance on a diverse range of imaging assays often used in disciplines such as microbial ecology, microbiology and synthetic biology. We also assessed its potential use in a high school environment to teach biology, hardware design, optics, and programming.

When the volume of the sample is on the microliter or nanoliter scale (e.g., cells, microorganisms, precious samples, or samples in microfluidic devices), accurate measurement of the sample temperature becomes challenging. In this work, we demonstrate a technique for accurately determining the temperature of microliter volumes using a simple 3D-printed microfluidic chip. We accomplish this by first filling “microfluidic thermometer” channels on the chip with substances with precisely known freezing/melting points. We then use a thermoelectric cooler to create a stable and linear temperature gradient along these channels within a measurement region on the chip. A custom software tool (available as online Supporting Information) is then used to find the locations of solid-liquid interfaces in the thermometer channels; these locations have known temperatures equal to the freezing/melting points of the substances in the channels. The software then uses the locations of these interfaces to calculate the temperature at any desired point within the measurement region. Using this approach, the temperature of any microliter-scale on-chip sample can be measured with an uncertainty of about a quarter of a degree Celsius. As a proof-of-concept, we use this technique to measure the unknown freezing point of a 50 microliter volume of solution and demonstrate its feasibility on a 400 nanoliter sample. Additionally, this technique can be used to measure the temperature of any on-chip sample, not just near-zero-Celsius freezing points. We demonstrate this by using an oil that solidifies near room temperature (coconut oil) in a microfluidic thermometer to measure on-chip temperatures well above zero Celsius. By providing a low-cost and simple way to accurately measure temperatures in small volumes, this technique should find applications in both research and educational laboratories.","2017-12-28","2019-09-03 16:48:36","2019-09-03 16:48:36","2019-09-03 16:48:36","e0189430","","12","12","","PLOS ONE","A microfluidic thermometer","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/AI2BVLYB/McKenzie and Grover - 2017 - A microfluidic thermometer Precise temperature me.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/RFLA8AET/article.html","","","3D printing; Microfluidics; Thermometers; Isotherms; Liquids; Sodium chloride; Temperature gradients; Vegetable oils","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The goal of this research was to design a WDO with user (N = 3) and orthotist (N = 6) feedback to improve the accessibility, customizability, and function of WDOs by harnessing advancements in 3D-printing. The 3D-printed WDO reduced hands-on assembly time to approximately 1.5 hours and the material costs to $15 compared to current fabrication methods. Varying improvements in users' hand function were observed during functional tests, such as the Jebsen Taylor Hand Function Test. For example, one participant's ability on the small object task improved by 29 seconds with the WDO, while another participant took 25 seconds longer to complete this task with the WDO. Two users had a significant increase in grasp strength with the WDO (13–122% increase), while the other participant was able to perform a pinching grasp for the first time. The WDO designs are available open-source to increase accessibility and encourage future innovation.","2018-02-22","2019-09-03 16:45:29","2019-09-03 16:45:29","2019-09-03 16:45:29","e0193106","","2","13","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/N5BMC48L/Portnova et al. - 2018 - Design of a 3D-printed, open-source wrist-driven o.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/RQJBVTLI/article.html","","","3D printing; Manufacturing processes; Hands; Assistive technologies; Orthotics; Prosthetics; Thumbs; Wrist","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We provide a methodology for the design, development and test results of each part of the device, as well as of the entire system. In addition to dosing reagents by means of a low-cost peristaltic pump, we also present carefully controlled dosing of reagents by an open-source syringe pump. The upgrading of the basic open-source syringe pump is given in terms of pump control and application of a larger syringe. In addition to the basic functions of pH stat, i.e. pH value measurement and maintenance, an improvement allowing the device to be used for potentiometric titration has been made as well. We have demonstrated the device’s utility when applied for cellulose fibers oxidation with 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl radical, i.e. for TEMPO-mediated oxidation. In support of this, we present the results obtained for the oxidation kinetics, the consumption of added reagent and experimental repeatability. Considering that the open-source scientific tools are available to everyone, and that researchers can construct and adjust the device according to their needs, as well as, that the total cost of the open-source pH stat device, excluding the existing laboratory equipment (pH meter, computer and glossary) was less than 150 EUR, we believe that, at a small fraction of the cost of available commercial offers, our open-source pH stat can significantly improve experimental work where the use of pH stat is necessary.","2018-03-06","2019-09-03 16:44:56","2019-09-03 16:44:56","2019-09-03 16:44:56","e0193744","","3","13","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/BCMUGPLH/Milanovic et al. - 2018 - Do-It-Yourself reliable pH-stat device by using .pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/VSAST9ZR/article.html","","","Computer hardware; Open source software; Open source hardware; Graphical user interface; Computer software; Cellulose; Laboratory equipment; Oxidation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the fields of materials science and mechanical engineering, fundamental equipment such as tensile testing devices can cost tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars. While a research lab often has access to a large-scale testing machine suitable for conventional samples, loading devices for meso- and micro-scale samples for in-situ testing with the myriad of microscopy tools are often hard to source and cost prohibitive. Open-source software has allowed for great strides in the reduction of costs associated with software development and open-source hardware and additive manufacturing have the potential to similarly reduce the costs of scientific equipment and increase the accessibility of scientific research. To investigate the feasibility of open-source hardware, a micro-tensile tester was designed with a freely accessible computer-aided design package and manufactured with a desktop 3D-printer and off-the-shelf components. To our knowledge this is one of the first demonstrations of a tensile tester with additively manufactured components for scientific research. The capabilities of the tensile tester were demonstrated by investigating the mechanical properties of Graphene Oxide (GO) paper and thin films. A 3D printed tensile tester was successfully used in conjunction with an atomic force microscope to provide one of the first quantitative measurements of GO thin film buckling under compression. The tensile tester was also used in conjunction with an atomic force microscope to observe the change in surface topology of a GO paper in response to increasing tensile strain. No significant change in surface topology was observed in contrast to prior hypotheses from the literature. Based on this result obtained with the new open source tensile stage we propose an alternative hypothesis we term ‘superlamellae consolidation’ to explain the initial deformation of GO paper. The additively manufactured tensile tester tested represents cost savings of >99% compared to commercial solutions in its class and offers simple customization. However, continued development is needed for the tensile tester presented here to approach the technical specifications achievable with commercial solutions.","2018-05-29","2019-09-03 15:56:39","2019-12-02 10:33:43","2019-09-03 15:56:39","e0197999","","5","13","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/3JYHZNHD/Nandy et al. - 2018 - Open-source micro-tensile testers via additive man.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/VT89KJJ9/Nandy et al. - 2018 - Open-source micro-tensile testers via additive man.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/9AQH5EHV/article.html; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/XLAZ4LSY/article.html","","","Open source hardware; 3D printing; Equipment; Scanning electron microscopy; Deformation; Atomic force microscopy; Buckling; Thin films","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We powered an ArduPilot Mega (APM) 2.6 with a 5V 11 Ah lithium ion battery (a smartphone power bank), placed the APM and battery in a waterproof sportsman’s box, and tossed the box and its contents by hand onto an 80 m-long iceberg from an 8 m boat. The data stream could be viewed on a laptop, which greatly enhanced safety while collecting conductivity/temperature/depth (CTD) profiles from the small boat in the iceberg’s vicinity. The 10 s position data allowed us to compute the distance of each CTD profile to the iceberg, which is necessary to determine if a given CTD profile was collected within the iceberg’s meltwater plume. The APM position data greatly reduced position uncertainty when compared to 5 min position data obtained from a Spot Trace unit. The APM functioned for over 10 h without depleting the battery. We describe the specific hardware used and the software settings necessary to use the APM as a real-time iceberg tracker. Furthermore, the methods described here apply to all Ardupilot-compatible autopilots. Given the low cost ($90) and ease of use, drone autopilots like the APM should be included as another tool for studying iceberg motion and for enhancing safety of marine operations. •Commercial off-the-shelf iceberg trackers are typically configured to record positions over relatively long intervals (months to years) and are not well-suited for short-term (hours to few days), high-frequency monitoring•Drone autopilots are cheap and provide high-frequency (>1 Hz) and real-time information about iceberg drift and orientation•Drone autopilots and ground control software can be easily adapted to studies of iceberg-ocean interactions and operational iceberg management","2018-01-01","2019-09-03 15:56:09","2019-09-03 15:56:09","2019-09-03 15:56:09","1059-1072","","","5","","MethodsX","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/A5K3ES7W/Carlson and Rysgaard - 2018 - Adapting open-source drone autopilots for real-tim.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/D9WR5PUK/S2215016118301456.html","","","Drone autopilot; Iceberg drift and orientation; Iceberg tracking; Iceberg-ocean interaction; Low-cost; Operational iceberg management; Real-time iceberg drift and orientation observations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This limits researchers to using expensive commercially available or custom-built light sources which make it difficult to replicate, standardize, optimize, and scale experiments. Here we present an open-source Microplate Photoirradiation System (MPS) developed to enable high-throughput light experiments in standard 96 and 24-well microplates for a variety of applications in photobiology research. This open-source system features 96 independently controlled LEDs (4 LEDs per well in 24-well), Wi-Fi connected control and programmable graphical user interface (GUI) for control and programming, automated calibration GUI, and modular control and LED boards for maximum flexibility. A web-based GUI generates light program files containing irradiation parameters for groups of LEDs. These parameters are then uploaded wirelessly, stored and used on the MPS to run photoirradiation experiments inside any incubator. A rapid and semi-quantitative porphyrin metabolism assay was also developed to validate the system in wild-type fibroblasts. Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) fluorescence accumulation was induced by incubation with 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), a photosensitization method leveraged clinically to destroy malignant cell types in a process termed photodynamic therapy (PDT), and cells were irradiated with 405nm light with varying irradiance, duration and pulsation parameters. Immediately after light treatment with the MPS, subsequent photobleaching was measured in live, adherent cells in both 96-well and a 24-well microplates using a microplate reader. Results demonstrate the utility and reliability of the Microplate Photoirradiation System to irradiate cells with precise irradiance and timing parameters in order to measure PpIx photobleaching kinetics in live adherent cells and perform comparable experiments with both 24 and 96 well microplate formats. The high-throughput capability of the MPS enabled measurement of enough irradiance conditions in a single microplate to fit PpIX fluorescence to a bioexponential decay model of photobleaching, as well as reveal a dependency of photobleaching on duty-cycle—but not frequency—in a pulsed irradiance regimen.","2018-10-05","2019-09-03 15:55:57","2019-09-03 15:55:57","2019-09-03 15:55:57","e0203597","","10","13","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/URNRWKVM/Katz et al. - 2018 - Design and validation of an open-source modular Mi.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/2G9SH9CH/article.html","","","Light; Fluorescence; Artificial light; Fibroblasts; Graphical user interfaces; Heme; Light pulses; Porphyrins","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we describe the development and validation of this system, which we term the optoPAD. We use the optoPAD to induce appetitive and aversive effects on feeding by activating or inhibiting gustatory neurons in closed loop – effectively creating virtual taste realities. The use of optogenetics allowed us to vary the dynamics and probability of stimulation in single flies and assess the impact on feeding behavior quantitatively and with high throughput.

This work presents an “integrated microfluidic electrochemical detector” (iMED) three-electrode multi-potentiostat designed around operational amplifiers connected to a powerful WiFi-based microcontroller as a promising alternative to more expensive and complex strategies reported in the literature. The iMED is integrated with a microfluidic system developed to be controlled by the same microcontroller. The iMED is programmed wirelessly over a standard WiFi network and all electrochemical data is uploaded to an open-source cloud-based server. A wired desktop computer is not necessary for operation or program uploading. This method of integrated microfluidic automation is simple, uses common and inexpensive materials, and is compatible with commercial sample injectors. An integrated biosensor platform contains four screen-printed carbon arrays inside 4 separate microfluidic detection chambers with Pt counter and pseudo Ag/AgCl reference electrodes in situ. The iMED is benchmarked with K3[Fe(CN)6] against a commercial potentiostat and then as a glucose biosensor using glucose-oxidising films of [Os(2,2′-bipyridine)2(poly-vinylimidazole)10Cl] prepared on screen-printed electrodes with multi walled carbon nanotubes, poly(ethylene glycol) diglycidyl ether and flavin adenine dinucleotide-dependent glucose dehydrogenase. Potential application of this cost-effective wireless potentiostat approach to modern bioelectronics and point-of-care diagnosis is demonstrated by production of glucose oxidation currents, under pseudo-physiological conditions, using mediating films with lower redox potentials.","2019-07-01","2019-09-03 15:47:27","2019-09-03 15:47:27","2019-09-03 15:47:27","616-624","","","290","","Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/F2R45HNW/Mercer et al. - 2019 - Glucose biosensor based on open-source wireless mi.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/REHFA7PY/S0925400519302424.html","","","IoT; Open-source; Enzyme-based biosensor; Microfluidic biosensor; Smartphone; Wireless","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To achieve complete separation of the two phases, the fluid streams at the separator outlets are monitored optically, and the back-pressure at one outlet is iteratively adjusted using a motorised needle valve until smooth time-invariant signals are recorded at both outlets. The separator may be applied to many pairings of immiscible liquids over a broad range of flow rates, automatically establishing complete separation within minutes of activation and adjusting dynamically to subsequent changes in the flow conditions.

In most of the low-budget mammalian cell study laboratories, highly skilled laboratory personnel should determine microscopic changes in microplate well media by taking the microplate outside the incubator and by imaging each well medium under a microscope, with the risk of contamination and reliability degrading. An alternative solution is to use an in-incubator operated live-cell imaging device, which, however, cannot be afforded by low-cost laboratories. In this paper, we present the design, realization, and test stages of a microplate compatible inverted bright-field microscope system that can be used in incubators. The developed system enables real-time and long-term in-incubator imaging of any user-selectable microplate type. The device can capture bright-field microscopic images by using a low-cost CMOS image sensor, an inverted varifocal CCTV lens and an array of light emitting diodes. In addition, by developed two-axial movement stage and image augmenting algorithms, the whole area of a user selectable well (e.g. area of a 6.5 mm diameter well in a 96-well plate) can be automatically imaged without using any other third party software. The long-term performance of the system is tested in incubators with human embryonic kidney and breast cancer cell lines.","2019","2019-09-03 15:38:13","2019-09-03 15:38:13","","58764-58779","","","7","","","Incu-Stream 1.0","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/3BEYKNVX/8706880.html; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/QBIKKAX8/Gürkan and Gürkan - 2019 - Incu-Stream 1.0 An Open-Hardware Live-Cell Imagin.pdf","","","Hardware; Software; biomedical optical imaging; medical image processing; Microscopy; optical microscopy; automated mechanical scanning; breast cancer cell lines; bright-field microscope system; bright-field microscopic images; bright-field microscopy; cancer; cell-culture studies; cellular biophysics; CMOS image sensor; CMOS image sensors; Drugs; human embryonic kidney; image augmenting algorithms; image enhancement; image stitching; incu-stream; inverted bright-field microscopy; inverted varifocal CCTV lens; kidney; Laboratories; Lenses; light emitting diodes; live-cell imaging; live-cell imaging device; long-term imaging; long-term in-incubator imaging; low-budget mammalian cell study laboratories; Open-hardware; open-hardware live-cell imaging system; test tubes; time-lapse imaging; two-axial movement stage; user-selectable microplate type","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Automated analytical workflows decrease the amount of required work. However, commercial automated platforms are mainly available for well-established sample processing methods. In contrast, newly developed prototypes of analytical instruments are often operated manually, what limits their performance and decreases the chance of their adoption by the broader community. Open-source electronic modules facilitate the prototyping of complex analytical instruments and enable the incorporation of automated functions at the early stage of technique development. Here, we exemplify this advantage of open-source electronics while prototyping an automated analytical device. Fizzy extraction takes advantage of the effervescence phenomenon to extract semi-volatile solutes from the liquid to the gas phase. The entire fizzy extraction process has been automated by using three Arduino-related microcontrollers. The functions of the developed autonomous fizzy extraction device include triggering the analysis by a smartphone app, control of carrier gas pressure in the headspace of the sample chamber, displaying experimental conditions on an LCD screen, acquiring mass spectrometry data in real time, filtering electronic noise, integrating peaks, calculating the analyte concentration in the extracted sample, printing the analysis report, storing the acquired data in non-volatile memory, monitoring the condition of the motor by counting the number of extraction cycles, and cleaning the elements exposed to the sample (to minimize carryover). The performance of this automated system has been evaluated using standards and real samples.</p>","2019-05-01","2019-09-03 15:37:31","2019-09-03 15:37:31","2019-09-03 15:37:31","e01639","","5","5","","Heliyon","","","","","","","","English","","","","","www.heliyon.com","","PMID: 31193233","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/22YBVNLP/Yang et al. - 2019 - Automation of fizzy extraction enabled by inexpens.pdf; ; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/5GMNFL6R/e01639.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31193233","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A proper application of these paradigms depends on a reliable measurement of the ASR amplitudes and an exact stimulus presentation in terms of frequency and intensity. Here, we introduce a novel open-source solution for the construction of a low-cost ASR setup. The complete software for data acquisition and stimulus presentation is written in Python 3.6 and is provided as an Anaconda package. Furthermore, we provide a construction plan for the sensor system based on low-cost hardware components. Exemplary GPIAS data from two animal models (Mus musculus, Meriones unguiculatus) show that the ratio histograms (1-PPI) of the gap-pre-stimulus and no pre-stimulus ASR amplitudes can be well described by a log-normal distribution being in good accordance to previous studies with already established setups. Furthermore, it can be shown that the PPI as a function of pre-stimulus intensity (threshold paradigm) can be approximated with a hard-sigmoid function enabling a reproducible sensory threshold estimation. Thus, we show that the open-source solution could help to further establish the ASR method in many laboratories and, thus, facilitate and standardize research in animal models of tinnitus and/or hearing loss.","2019","2019-09-03 15:35:50","2019-09-03 15:35:50","2019-09-03 15:35:50","","","","13","","Front.

These blocks are typically made from casting Cerrobend alloys containing lead and cadmium. This is a highly toxic process with limited precision. This work aims to provide streamlined and more precise electron radiotherapy by 3D using printing techniques. Methods The 3D printed electron cutout consists of plastic shells filled with 2 mm diameter tungsten ball bearings. Five clinical Cerrobend defined field were compared to the planned fields by measuring the light field edge when mounted in the electron applicator on a linear accelerator. The dose transmitted through the 3D printed and Cerrobend cutouts was measured using an IC profiler ion chamber array with 6 MeV and 16 MeV beams. Dose profiles from the treatment planning system were also compared to the measured dose profiles. Centering and full width half maximum (FWHM) metrics were taken directly from the profiler software. Results The transmission of a 16MeV beam through a 12 mm thick layer of tungsten ball bearings agreed within 1% of a 15 mm thick Cerrobend block (measured with an ion chamber array). The radiation fields shaped by ball bearing filled 3D printed cutout were centered within 0.4 mm of the planned outline, whereas the Cerrobend cutout fields had shift errors of 1–3 mm, and shape errors of 0.5–2 mm. The average shift of Cerrobend cutouts was 2.3 mm compared to the planned fields (n = 5). Beam penumbra of the 3D printed cutouts was found to be equivalent to the 15 mm thick Cerrobend cutout. The beam profiles agreed within 1.2% across the whole 30 cm profile widths. Conclusions This study demonstrates that with a proper quality assurance procedure, 3D-printed cutouts can provide more accurate electron radiotherapy with reduced toxicity compared to traditional Cerrobend methods.","2019-06-19","2019-09-03 15:35:40","2019-09-03 15:35:40","2019-09-03 15:35:40","e0217757","","6","14","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/6W977BBG/Skinner et al. - 2019 - Tungsten filled 3D printed field shaping devices f.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/NV5SM4TS/article.html","","","3D printing; Radiation therapy; Castings; Electron density; Hazardous materials; Lead alloys; Metallic lead; Tungsten","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, existing methods for measuring physical activity have limitations which include high expense, specialized caging or equipment, and high computational overhead. To address these limitations, we present an open-source, cost-effective, device for measuring rodent activity. Our device is battery powered and designed to be placed in vivarium home cages to enable high-throughput, long-term operation with minimal investigator intervention. The primary aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of using passive infrared (PIR) sensors and microcontroller-based dataloggers in a rodent home cages to collect physical activity records. To this end, we developed an open-source PIR based data-logging device called the rodent activity detector (RAD). We publish the design files and code so others can readily build the RAD in their own labs. To demonstrate its utility, we used the RAD to collect physical activity data from 40 individually housed mice for up to 10 weeks. This dataset demonstrates the ability of the RAD to (1) operate in a high-throughput installation, (2) detect high-fat diet (HFD)-induced changes in physical activity, and (3) quantify circadian rhythms in individual animals. We further validated the data output of the RAD with simultaneous video tracking of mice in multiple caging configurations, to determine the features of physical activity that it detects. The RAD is easy to build, economical, and fits in vivarium caging. The scalability of such devices will enable high-throughput studies of physical activity in research studies.","2019-07-01","2019-09-03 15:34:24","2019-09-03 15:34:27","2019-09-03 15:34:24","ENEURO.0160-19.2019","","4","6","","eNeuro","","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 2019 Matikainen-Ankney et al..

These have been valid and limiting issues in the past, but no longer. Technological advances associated with the so-called maker movement render them moot. We demonstrate this by implementing a fast (∼100 kHz) dynamic clamp system using an inexpensive microcontroller (Teensy 3.6). The overall cost of the system is less than USD$100, and assembling it requires no prior electronics experience. Modifying it—for example, to add Hodgkin–Huxley-style conductances—requires no prior programming experience. The system works together with existing electrophysiology data acquisition systems (for Macintosh, Windows, and Linux); it does not attempt to supplant them. Moreover, the process of assembling, modifying, and using the system constitutes a useful pedagogical exercise for students and researchers with no background but an interest in electronics and programming. We demonstrate the system’s utility by implementing conductances as fast as a transient sodium conductance and as complex as the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck conductances of the “point conductance” model of synaptic background activity.","2017-09-01","2019-08-18 11:13:06","2019-12-02 10:42:35","2019-09-03 10:18:52","ENEURO.0250-17.2017","","5","4","","eNeuro","","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 2017 Desai et al..

All too often, however, students do not have a good understanding of the optical principles that govern microscopy and lack access to instruments that could help them build that understanding. Here we present an open-source Do-It-Yourself (DIY) microscope kit developed by scientists and students at BioBus, a nonprofit organization for science outreach and education based in New York City (www.biobus.org). The DIY microscope uses 3D printing to make highly adaptable optical technology readily available to educators at a low cost. Its modular configuration makes it the perfect tool to teach optical design to students of all ages. At BioBus, Inc., over 230 school-age students and teachers learned basic optics and microscope building with the DIY microscope at our community and mobile laboratories. <p> </p>We further present examples of how the DIY microscope was used as a platform for student-driven projects, expanding the original design to include advanced optical features such as fluorescence and infrared imaging. The images, acquired with a low cost camera, were comparable in quality to those taken using professional grade laboratory microscopes. The use of the DIY microscope is not limited to applications in physical sciences, but can also be used as an interdisciplinary teaching tool. As an example, we showed how it was configured into a functional model of the eye, to explain the physics of vision and the pathophysiology of eye disorders, such as far and short-sightedness, and age-related macular degeneration.","2018-09-14","2019-09-01 16:33:05","2019-09-01 16:33:05","2019-09-01 16:33:05","107410K","","","10741","","","","","","","","International Society for Optics and Photonics","","","","","","","www.spiedigitallibrary.org","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/GTZXG5SQ/Grier et al. - 2018 - A low-cost do-it-yourself microscope kit for hands.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/94AZJ2PM/12.2320655.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Optics Education and Outreach V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Printed fluorescence imaging boxes (PFIboxes) cost approximately 200 US dollars to assemble, can be placed in incubators or hypoxic chambers, and accurately read high-density colony arrays of microorganisms. We demonstrate the utility of PFIboxes using a time course gene expression approach, examining global Escherichia coli promoter activity using a fluorescent reporter library across a diverse panel of 15 antibiotics, each at several concentrations. Many secondary and indirect effects were observed when E. coli was challenged with various drugs, including increased gene expression in carbon metabolism processes. Further, kinetic data acquisition enabled non-destructive time course gene expression, clustering of which revealed patterns of co-expression. In all, PFIboxes provide an open solution to gene expression, for about 2 US dollars per treatment condition, including technical replicates.","2018-09-26","2019-09-01 16:27:56","2019-09-01 16:27:56","2019-09-01 16:27:56","339-346.e3","","3","7","","Cell Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/SYV86W9A/French et al. - 2018 - Open-Source High-Throughput Phenomics of Bacterial.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/37R7RNRU/S2405471218302837.html","","","open source; 3D printing; antibiotics; chemical genomics; fluorescence reporters; gene expression; phenomics; quantitative imaging; stress response","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The same principle can be applied to scanning angle interference microscopy (SAIM), where precision control of the scanned laser beam presents unique technical challenges for the builders of custom azimuthal scanning microscopes. Accurate synchronization between the instrument computer, beam scanning system and excitation source is required to collect high quality data and minimize sample damage in SAIM acquisitions. Drawing inspiration from open-source prototyping systems, like the Arduino microcontroller boards, we developed a new instrument control platform to be affordable, easily programmed, and broadly useful, but with integrated, precision analog circuitry and optimized firmware routines tailored to advanced microscopy. We show how the integration of waveform generation, multiplexed analog outputs, and native hardware triggers into a single central hub provides a versatile platform for performing fast circle-scanning acquisitions, including azimuthal scanning SAIM and multiangle TIRF. We also demonstrate how the low communication latency of our hardware platform can reduce image intensity and reconstruction artifacts arising from synchronization errors produced by software control.

Such implants are skull-mounted, and made from a hard, durable material, such as titanium. New method Here, we present a low-cost method of creating customized 3D-printed cranial implants that are tailored to the anatomy of individual animals. We performed pre-surgical computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) scans to generate three-dimensional (3D) models of the skull and brain. We then used 3D modelling software to design implantable head posts, chambers, and a pedestal anchorage base, as well as craniotomy guides to aid us during surgery. Prototypes were made from plastic or resin, while implants were 3D-printed in titanium. The implants underwent post-processing and received a coating of osteocompatible material to promote bone integration. Results Their tailored fit greatly facilitated surgical implantation, and eliminated the gap between the implant and the bone. To date, our implants remain robust and well-integrated with the skull. Comparison with existing method(s) Commercial-off-the-shelf solutions typically come with a uniform, flat base, preventing them from sitting flush against the curved surface of the skull. This leaves gaps for fluid and tissue ingress, increasing the risk of microbial infection and tissue inflammation, as well as implant loss. Conclusions The use of 3D printing technology enabled us to quickly and affordably create unique, complex designs, avoiding the constraints levied by traditional production methods, thereby boosting experimental success and improving the wellbeing of the animals.","2017-07-15","2019-08-18 12:03:51","2019-08-18 12:03:51","2019-08-18 12:03:51","38-55","","","286","","Journal of Neuroscience Methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/ZHK5P6NC/Chen et al. - 2017 - 3D printing and modelling of customized implants a.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/V6DVMN44/S0165027017301322.html","","","3D printing; Electrophysiology; Cranial implants; Primate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study successfully tested and validated the instrument, which can be operated anywhere in the world with no electricity inputs, obtaining a radial velocity of over 1750 rpm and over 50 N of relative centrifugal force. Using commercial filament, the instrument costs about U.S. $25, which is less than half of all commercially available systems.

Despite the widespread use of chronic electrophysiology, the precise positioning of recording electrodes required for high-quality recordings remains a challenge, especially in behaving mice. The complexity of available drive mechanisms, combined with restrictions on implant weight tolerated by mice, limits current methods to recordings from no more than 4-8 electrodes in a single target area. We developed a highly miniaturized yet simple drive design that can be used to independently position 16 electrodes with up to 64 channels in a package that weighs approximately 2g. This advance over current designs is achieved by a novel spring-based drive mechanism that reduces implant weight and complexity. The device is easy to build and accommodates arbitrary spatial arrangements of electrodes. Multiple optical fibers can be integrated into the recording array and independently manipulated in depth. Thus, our novel design enables precise optogenetic control and highly parallel chronic recordings of identified single neurons throughout neural circuits in mice.","2013","2019-08-09 16:31:12","2019-08-09 16:31:12","2019-08-09 16:31:12","","","","7","","Front.

Though chosen for its ease of husbandry, maintaining large numbers of stocks of fruit flies, as done by many laboratories, is labour-intensive. One task which lends itself to automation is the production of the vials of food in which the flies are reared. Fly facilities typically have to generate several thousand vials of fly food each week to sustain their fly stocks. The system presented here combines a cartesian coordinate robot with a peristaltic pump. The design of the robot is based on an open hardware CNC (computer numerical control) machine, and uses belt and pulley actuators for the X and Y axes, and a leadscrew actuator for the Z axis. CNC motion and operation of the peristaltic pump are controlled by grbl (gnea 2018), an open source, embedded, G-code parser. Grbl is written in optimized C and runs directly on an Arduino. A Raspberry Pi is used to generate and stream G-code instructions to Grbl. A touch screen on the Raspberry Pi provides a graphical user interface to the system. Whilst the robot was built for the express purpose of filling vials of fly food, it could potentially be used for other liquid handling tasks in the laboratory.","2018-07-31","2019-08-08 11:12:21","2019-08-08 11:12:21","2019-08-08 11:12:21","3","","1","2","","","","","","","","","","eng","Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:    Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a  Creative Commons Attribution License  that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.

Despite their educational potential, quadrupole ion traps are seldom introduced into the physics classroom not least because commercial quadrupole ion traps appropriate for classroom use are expensive and difficult to set up. We present an open hardware 3D-printable quadrupole ion trap suitable for the classroom, which is capable of trapping lycopodium spores. We also provide student worksheets developed in an iterative design process, which can guide students while discovering particle traps. The quadrupole ion trap operates using a 3 kV 50 Hz alternating current power supply and uses an astable multivibrator circuit including high luminosity LEDs to illuminate the spores, using the stroboscopic effect to exhibit their movement. The trap can be used in teaching laboratories to enhance high school and university students’ understanding of electric fields and their applications.","","2019-08-08 11:12:19","2019-12-02 10:03:53","2019-08-08 11:12:19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/3Z27JN9E/3D-Printable Model of a Particle Trap Development.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/8XACVHTT/joh.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, printed parts are typically plastic and often perform poorly compared to traditionally machined mechanisms. We have overcome many of the limitations of 3D printed mechanisms by exploiting the compliance of the plastic to produce a monolithic 3D printed flexure translation stage, capable of sub-micron-scale motion over a range of 8 × 8 × 4 mm. This requires minimal post-print clean-up and can be automated with readily available stepper motors. The resulting plastic composite structure is very stiff and exhibits remarkably low drift, moving less than 20 μm over the course of a week, without temperature stabilisation. This enables us to construct a miniature microscope with excellent mechanical stability, perfect for time-lapse measurements in situ in an incubator or fume hood. The ease of manufacture lends itself to use in containment facilities where disposability is advantageous and to experiments requiring many microscopes in parallel. High performance mechanisms based on printed flexures need not be limited to microscopy, and we anticipate their use in other devices both within the laboratory and beyond.","2016-02-01","2019-08-08 11:08:38","2019-08-08 11:08:38","2019-08-08 11:08:38","025104","","2","87","","Review of Scientific Instruments","","","","","","","","","","","","","aip.scitation.org (Atypon)","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/WXZGXWW2/Sharkey et al. - 2016 - A one-piece 3D printed flexure translation stage f.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/BP6YHLCU/1.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

All components except the optics, light source, camera, breadboard, and integrated fluorescence accessory mount were either parametrically designed and printed or purchasable at a local hardware store.

In part due to these cost savings, the manufacturing of scientific equipment is beginning to move away from a central paradigm of purchasing proprietary equipment to one in which scientists themselves download open-source designs, fabricate components with digital manufacturing technology, and then assemble the equipment themselves. This trend introduces a need for new formal design procedures that designers can follow when targeting this scientific audience. This study provides five steps in the procedure, encompassing six design principles for the development of free and open-source hardware for scientific applications. A case study is provided for an open-source slide dryer that can be easily fabricated for under $20, which is more than 300 times less than some commercial alternatives. The bespoke design is parametric and easily adjusted for many applications. By designing using open-source principles and the proposed procedures, the outcome will be customizable, under control of the researcher, less expensive than commercial options, more maintainable, and will have many applications that benefit the user since the design documentation is open and freely accessible.","2017-12-30","2018-09-10 06:39:34","2019-12-02 10:48:16","2018-09-10 06:39:34","2","","1","2","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/RBRCGPTC/Oberloier et al. - 2017 - General Design Procedure for Free and Open-Source .pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/4BYRS3UH/Oberloier et al. - 2017 - General Design Procedure for Free and Open-Source .pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/4DGLLI92/Oberloier and Pearce - 2018 - General Design Procedure for Free and Open-Source .pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/PKRFT52J/2.html; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/YQELNXBM/2.html; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/UF7G5LSS/2.html","","FOSH; open design; 3D printing; RepRap; open science hardware; open hardware; open scientific hardware; OScH; P2P; P2P manufacturing; distributed manufacturing; free and open-source hardware; custom designs; customization; free and open-source software; OpenSCAD; scientific equipment; slide dryer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A major limitation of laboratory centrifuges is their “black box” nature, limiting sample observation to before and after centrifugation. Thus, optimized protocols require significant trial and error, while unoptimized protocols waste time by centrifuging longer than necessary or material due to incomplete sedimentation. Here, we developed an instrumented centrifuge tube receptacle compatible with several commercial benchtop centrifuges that can provide real-time sample analysis during centrifugation. We demonstrated the system by monitoring cell separations during centrifugation for different spin speeds, concentrations, buffers, cell types, and temperatures. We show that the collected data are valuable for analytical purposes (e.g. quality control), or as feedback to the user or the instrument. For the latter, we verified an adaptation where complete sedimentation turned off the centrifuge and notified the user by a text message. Our system adds new functionality to existing laboratory centrifuges, saving users time and providing useful feedback.

These detector architectures can be exploited in the design of space instrumentation for gamma-spectroscopy with the benefit of possible smart background rejection strategies. We describe a detector prototype with 3D imaging capabilities to be employed in future gamma-ray and particle space missions in the 0.002–100 MeV energy range. The instrument is based on a stack of scintillating bars read out by Silicon Drift Detectors (SDDs) at both ends. The spatial segmentation and the crystal double-side readout allow a 3D position reconstruction with ~3 mm accuracy within the full active volume, using a 2D readout along the two external faces of the detector. Furthermore, one of the side of SDDs can be used simultaneously to detect X-rays in the 2–30 keV energy range.

In addition to their low maintenance costs and easy sharing of strains across labs, one key appeal is the possibility to monitor single or groups of animals in a behavioural arena while controlling the activity of select neurons using optogenetic or thermogenetic tools. However, the purchase of a commercial solution for these types of experiments, including an appropriate camera system as well as a controlled behavioural arena, can be costly. Here, we present a low-cost and modular open-source alternative called ‘FlyPi’. Our design is based on a 3D-printed mainframe, a Raspberry Pi computer, and high-definition camera system as well as Arduino-based optical and thermal control circuits. Depending on the configuration, FlyPi can be assembled for well under €100 and features optional modules for light-emitting diode (LED)-based fluorescence microscopy and optogenetic stimulation as well as a Peltier-based temperature stimulator for thermogenetics. The complete version with all modules costs approximately €200 or substantially less if the user is prepared to ‘shop around’. All functions of FlyPi can be controlled through a custom-written graphical user interface. To demonstrate FlyPi’s capabilities, we present its use in a series of state-of-the-art neurogenetics experiments. In addition, we demonstrate FlyPi’s utility as a medical diagnostic tool as well as a teaching aid at Neurogenetics courses held at several African universities. Taken together, the low cost and modular nature as well as fully open design of FlyPi make it a highly versatile tool in a range of applications, including the classroom, diagnostic centres, and research labs.","2017-07-18","2018-08-21 13:40:49","2018-08-21 13:41:47","2018-08-21 13:40:49","e2002702","","7","15","","PLOS Biology","The €100 lab","","","","","","","en","Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License (CC-BY-SA)","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/6DN2AW7L/Chagas et al. - 2017 - The €100 lab A 3D-printable open-source platform .pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/JQ8CITCA/article.html","","","3D printing; Zebrafish; Cameras; Fluorescence microscopy; Light-emitting diodes; Fluorescence imaging; Drosophila melanogaster; Larvae","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, in particular, non-technical challenges still hinder the broader development and application of LCSNs. This paper reviews the development of LCSNs over the last 15 years, highlighting trends and future opportunities for a diverse range of environmental applications. We found air quality, meteorological and water-related networks were particularly well represented with few studies focusing on sensor networks for ecological systems. Furthermore, we identified bias towards studies that have direct links to human health, safety and livelihoods. These studies were more likely to involve downstream data analytics, visualisations, and multi-stakeholder participation through citizen science initiatives. However, there was a paucity of studies that considered sustainability factors for the development and implementation of LCSNs. Existing LCSNs are largely focussed on detecting and mitigating events which have a direct impact on humans such as flooding, air pollution or geo-hazards, while these applications are important there is a need for future development of LCSNs for monitoring ecosystem structure and function. Our findings highlight three distinct opportunities for future research to unleash the full potential of LCSNs: (1) improvement of links between data collection and downstream activities; (2) the potential to broaden the scope of application systems and fields; and (3) to better integrate stakeholder engagement and sustainable operation to enable longer and greater societal impacts.","2019","2019-09-26 12:25:12","2019-09-26 12:25:18","2019-09-26 12:25:12","","","","7","","Front.

Common approaches for measuring liquid intake in real time include computer-tethered lickometers or video-based systems. Additionally, liquids can be measured or weighed to determine the amount consumed without real-time sensing. Here, we built a photobeam-based sipper device that has the following advantages over traditional methods: (1) it is battery powered and fits in vivarium caging to allow home-cage measurements; (2) it quantifies the intake of two different liquids simultaneously for preference studies; (3) it is low cost and easily constructed, enabling high-throughput experiments; and (4) it is open source so that others can modify it to fit their experimental needs. We validated the performance of this device in three experiments. First, we calibrated our device using time-lapse video-based measurements of liquid intake and correlated sipper interactions with liquid intake. Second, we used the sipper device to measure preference for water versus chocolate milk, demonstrating its utility for two-bottle choice tasks. Third, we integrated the device with fiber photometry, establishing its utility for measuring neural activity in studies of ingestive behavior. This device requires no special equipment or caging, and is small, battery powered, and wireless, allowing it to be placed directly in rodent home cages. The total cost of fabrication is less than $100, and all design files and code are open source. Together, these factors greatly increase scalability and utility for a variety of behavioral neuroscience applications.","2019-09-18","2019-09-26 14:46:50","2019-12-01 18:46:21","2019-09-26 14:46:50","","","5","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/II8BIUXE/ENEURO.0292-19.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To further expand the capabilities of open source syringe pumps we introduce a novel syringe pump design, the Ystruder. It features a load cell to monitor the piston force. This capability enables clog-detection as well as development of advanced dosing algorithms. The Ystruder can be monitored wirelessly through a browser-based interface that is integrated into the embedded system. The design is modular and simple which facilitates different syringe and motor configurations, to meet a wide range of use cases. Finally, the Ystruder is not limited to functioning solely as a pump as it can be integrated into a wide range of devices such as three-dimensional motion systems.

However, CropManage requires a flowmeter and a monitoring station to track water use in the field. In this article, we describe a device that was conceived as a low-cost alternative to Campbell Scientific flowmeter-monitoring stations that include data logger, modem, enclosure, battery, solar panel and charge regulator and cost above $2000. The device was designed for low-cost, ease of construction and with the capability of emulating the Campbell Scientific equipment functions and outputs. The devices were enabled with FTP communication to a central FTP server and were built with an Arduino MEGA, an Adafruit Datalogging Shield and an Adafruit FONA cellular modem. A voltage divider was added to monitor the external 12 V battery voltage and a DC/DC converter was used to convert 12 V to 5 V. Each field station, including the device, battery, enclosure and solar panel has a total cost below $300, while the FTP server costs less than $100. The device was tested for two years in filed conditions and gave output equivalent to the Campbell Scientific equipment.

Here we report the conversion of the worldwide used open source 3D printer (RepRap, Prusa i3) to a functional and affordable bioprinter by substituting the common plastic-extruder with the Nydus One Syringe Extruder (NOSE). The NOSE modification enables mechanical hydrogel extrusion as well as a tunable deposition precision and volume by featuring a modular syringe-holder concept. A cost effective and simple hardware design including a custom software (termed ‘composer’) was developed to prove that this technique can be made accessible for a broader public. Furthermore, the printing procedure was optimized for the peer-reviewed FRESH-method by Hinton et al. which allows to print geometrical complex cell-laden constructs. We provide a detailed protocol on the creation of the FRESH-gel to ensure the reproducibility of this state of the art method. As a proof of concept HEK293 cells as well as mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) were utilized for cell-laden printing. Depending on the cellular source the survival rates range from 60% up to 95%. Automatized quantitative viability analysis was performed using the open source image analysis tool Icy, in particular the “spot detector” plugin.

In this article, we describe the development of a low-cost dummy head impact rig. The motivation behind this project is to quantify the potential harm to a child’s head due to impacts with a small robotic toy. Three severity indices can be estimated, namely, Head Acceleration Criterion (HIC), 3 ms criterion, and peak head acceleration. Furthermore, the artificial skin of the dummy head can be used to assess the potential for tissue injuries. 3D-printed parts were used to develop the head. A tri-axial accelerometer embedded inside the head was used to measure the changes in accelerations. The developed head was placed inside a dedicated experimental bench. A data acquisition card that is connected to a computer system was used to acquire the raw data and then store it. A script was used to postprocess the stored data for the three severity indices. A video camera recording in slow-motion was used to record the impacts. The calculation of the impact velocities was based on the analysis of the video recordings using an open-source software.

Energy storage will be needed to take full advantage of abundant but intermittent energy sources. Even with economies of scale, the price is prohibitively high for a lithium-ion battery pack capable of storing tens of kilowatts of energy for many consumers. A more abundant and less expensive material is necessary. All-iron chemistry presents a transformative opportunity for stationary energy storage: it is simple, cheap, abundant, and safe. All-iron batteries can store energy by reducing iron (II) to metallic iron at the anode and oxidizing iron (II) to iron (III) at the cathode.

This method allows the detection through specific antibodies and the eventual quantification of the protein of interest in different biological lysates transferred onto a suitable membrane. This methodology involves several repetitive processes; one of them is the washing of blots after incubations with primary and secondary antibodies. The present device has been designed to automate this process at a low cost.

Commercial potentiostats function as “black boxes,” giving limited information about their circuitry and behaviour which can make development of new measurement techniques and integration with other instruments challenging. Recently, a number of lab-built potentiostats have emerged with various design goals including low manufacturing cost and field-portability, but notably lacking is an accessible potentiostat designed for general lab use, focusing on measurement quality combined with ease of use and versatility. To fill this gap, we introduce DStat (http://microfluidics.utoronto.ca/dstat), an open-source, general-purpose potentiostat for use alone or integrated with other instruments. DStat offers picoampere current measurement capabilities, a compact USB-powered design, and user-friendly cross-platform software. DStat is easy and inexpensive to build, may be modified freely, and achieves good performance at low current levels not accessible to other lab-built instruments. In head-to-head tests, DStat’s voltammetric measurements are much more sensitive than those of “CheapStat” (a popular open-source potentiostat described previously), and are comparable to those of a compact commercial “black box” potentiostat. Likewise, in head-to-head tests, DStat’s potentiometric precision is similar to that of a commercial pH meter. Most importantly, the versatility of DStat was demonstrated through integration with the open-source DropBot digital microfluidics platform. In sum, we propose that DStat is a valuable contribution to the “open source” movement in analytical science, which is allowing users to adapt their tools to their experiments rather than alter their experiments to be compatible with their tools.","2015-10-28","2019-09-12 11:45:16","2019-12-02 10:48:39","2019-11-16 14:38:41","e0140349","","10","10","","PLOS ONE","DStat","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/EW3NH5UC/Dryden and Wheeler - 2015 - DStat A Versatile, Open-Source Potentiostat for E.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/LAS3HBI7/Dryden and Wheeler - 2015 - DStat A Versatile, Open-Source Potentiostat for E.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/7SY75PPP/article.html; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/AZAGCUJY/article.html","","","Computer hardware; Electrical circuits; Electrochemical cells; Electrochemistry; Electrode potentials; Noise reduction; Open source software; Voltammetry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the most studied features of zebrafish is their exceptional swimming ability. By 7 days postfertilization (dpf), zebrafish spend over two-thirds of their time engaged in spontaneous swimming activity and several months later they are capable of attaining some of the fastest swimming velocities relative to body length ever recorded in the laboratory. However, laboratory-assembled flumes capable of achieving the slow flow velocities characteristics of larvae as well as the relatively fast maximal velocities of adults have not been described in sufficient detail to allow easy replication. Here we describe an easily assembled, open-source zebrafish-scaled flume for assessing swimming performance. The flume uses two independent spherical-impeller pumps modulated by a microcontroller to achieve flow velocities ranging from 1 to 70 cm s−1. The microcontroller also monitors water temperature and flow velocity and sends these data to a personal computer for real-time display and storage. Incremental protocols for assessing maximal swimming speed (Umax) were developed, stored in custom software, and then uploaded to the microcontroller in order to assess performance of larval (14, 21, 28 dpf), juvenile (35, 42 dpf), and adult (8, 22 month) zebrafish. The flume had sufficient range and sensitivity to detect developmental changes in Umax of larvae and juveniles, an 18–24% faster Umax of adult males vs. females, and a 14–20% age-related reduction in Umax for the oldest zebrafish. Detailed information is provided to assemble and operate this low-cost, versatile, and reliable tool for assessing zebrafish swimming performance.","2018-06-26","2019-11-16 14:42:09","2019-11-16 14:42:09","2019-11-16 14:42:09","e0199712","","6","13","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/92KYMW5I/Widrick et al. - 2018 - An open source microcontroller based flume for eva.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/AV3CGGMC/article.html","","","Animal performance; Zebrafish; Flow rate; Swimming; Fish physiology; Larvae; Fish; Microprocessors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, complementary vector control methods, such as the Sterile Insect Technique, are needed to enhance existing efforts. The technique relies on the rearing and release of large numbers of sterile males, and the development of efficient and standardized mass-rearing procedures and tools is essential for its application against medically important mosquitoes. Methods In the effort to reduce the cost of the rearing process, a prototype low-cost plexiglass mass-rearing cage has been developed and tested for egg production and egg hatch rate in comparison to the current Food and Agriculture Organization/International Atomic Energy Agency (FAO/IAEA) stainless-steel cage. Additionally, an adult-index was validated and used as a proxy to estimate the mosquito survival rates by counting the number of male and female mosquitoes that were resting within each of the 6 squares at a given point of time each day in the cage. Results The study has shown that the prototype mass-rearing cage is cheap and is as efficient as the FAO/IAEA stainless-steel cage in terms of egg production, with even better overall egg hatch rate. The mean numbers of eggs per cage, after seven cycles of blood feeding and egg collection, were 969,789 ± 138,101 and 779,970 ± 123,042, corresponding to 81 ± 11 and 65 ± 10 eggs per female over her lifespan, in the prototype and the stainless-steel-mass-rearing cages, respectively. The longevity of adult male and female mosquitoes was not affected by cage type and, the adult-index could be considered as an appropriate proxy for survival. Moreover, the mass-rearing cage prototype is easy to handle and transport and improves economic and logistic efficiency. Conclusion The low-cost mass-rearing prototype cage can be recommended to produce Ae. aegypti in the context of rear and release techniques. The proposed adult-index can be used as a quick proxy of mosquito survival rates in mass-rearing settings.","2019-09-25","2019-11-16 14:43:37","2019-11-16 14:43:37","2019-11-16 14:43:37","e0007775","","9","13","","PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/BM2N344C/Maïga et al. - 2019 - Reducing the cost and assessing the performance of.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/ANZV59SF/article.html","","","Prototypes; Mosquitoes; Larvae; Aedes aegypti; Blood; Death rates; Oviposition; Pupae","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is done using the capabilities of the Programmable System on a Chip (PSoC®) by Cypress Semiconductor, which integrates all of the necessary electrical components. This is in contrast to other recent papers that have developed potentiostats but require technical skills or specialized equipment to produce. This eliminates the process of having to make a printed circuit board and soldering on electronic components. To control the device, a graphical user interface (GUI) was developed in the python programming language. Python is open source, with a style that makes it easy to read and write programs, making it an ideal choice for open source projects. As the developed device is open source and based on a PSoC, modification to implement other electrochemical techniques is straightforward and only requires modest programming skills, but no expensive equipment or difficult techniques.

As we gain more insight into the genomic basis of pathogen infectivity and drug resistance, point-of-care nucleic acid testing will likely become an important tool for global health. In this paper, we present an inexpensive, handheld, battery-powered instrument designed to enable pathogen genotyping in the developing world. Our Microfluidic Biomolecular Amplification Reader (µBAR) represents the convergence of molecular biology, microfluidics, optics, and electronics technology. The µBAR is capable of carrying out isothermal nucleic acid amplification assays with real-time fluorescence readout at a fraction of the cost of conventional benchtop thermocyclers. Additionally, the µBAR features cell phone data connectivity and GPS sample geotagging which can enable epidemiological surveying and remote healthcare delivery. The µBAR controls assay temperature through an integrated resistive heater and monitors real-time fluorescence signals from 60 individual reaction chambers using LEDs and phototransistors. Assays are carried out on PDMS disposable microfluidic cartridges which require no external power for sample loading. We characterize the fluorescence detection limits, heater uniformity, and battery life of the instrument. As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrate the detection of the HIV-1 integrase gene with the µBAR using the Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) assay. Although we focus on the detection of purified DNA here, LAMP has previously been demonstrated with a range of clinical samples, and our eventual goal is to develop a microfluidic device which includes on-chip sample preparation from raw samples. The µBAR is based entirely around open source hardware and software, and in the accompanying online supplement we present a full set of schematics, bill of materials, PCB layouts, CAD drawings, and source code for the µBAR instrument with the goal of spurring further innovation toward low-cost genetic diagnostics.","2013-08-01","2019-11-16 14:47:06","2019-11-16 14:47:06","2019-11-16 14:47:06","e70266","","8","8","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/S7WNB6QJ/Myers et al. - 2013 - A Handheld Point-of-Care Genomic Diagnostic System.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/RI3E5QW9/article.html","","","Cell phones; Microfluidics; Signal amplification; Polymerase chain reaction; Signal processing; Chromatin immunoprecipitation; HIV; Nucleic acids","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, most conventional 2P microscopes impose significant constraints on the size of the imaging field-of-view and the specific shape of the effective excitation volume, thus limiting the scope of biological questions that can be addressed and the information obtainable. Here, employing 9divergent beam optics9 (DBO), we present an ultra-low-cost, easily implemented and flexible solution to address these limitations, offering a several-fold expanded three-dimensional field of view that also maintains single-cell resolution. We show that this implementation increases both the space-bandwidth product and effective excitation power, and allows for straight-forward tailoring of the point-spread-function. Moreover, rapid laser-focus control via an electrically tunable lens now allows near-simultaneous imaging of remote regions separated in three dimensions and permits the bending of imaging planes to follow natural curvatures in biological structures. Crucially, our core design is readily implemented (and reversed) within a matter of hours, and fully compatible with a wide range of existing 2P customizations, making it highly suitable as a base platform for further development.

Stimjim provides microsecond temporal resolution with microampere or millivolt scale precision on two electrically isolated output channels. We demonstrate Stimjim’s utility both in vitro by precisely stimulating brain slices, and in vivo by training mice to perform intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) for brain stimulation reward. During ICSS, Stimjim enables the experimenter to smoothly tune the strength of reward-seeking behavior by varying either the output frequency or amplitude.

These nanolayer spots serve as a “solid solvent,” embedding different chemicals, chemical building blocks, materials, or precursors and can be stacked on top of each other. By melting the spot pattern, the polymer-embedded molecules are released for chemical reaction. This enables researchers to quickly pattern a surface with different molecules and materials, mixing them directly on the surface for high-throughput chemical synthesis to generate and screen diverse microarray libraries. In contrast to expensive ink-jet or contact printing, this approach does not require premixing of inks, which enables in situ combinatorial mixing. Easy access and versatility of this patterning approach are shown by generating microarrays of various biomolecules, such as glycans for the first time, to screen interactions of antibodies and lectins. In addition, a layer-by-layer solid-phase synthesis of peptides directly on the microarray is presented. Amino acid–containing nanolayers are repeatedly laser-transferred and reacted with the functionalized acceptor surface in defined patterns.

Bacterial growth is usually monitored by measuring the optical density of bacteria in liquid media, using benchtop spectrophotometers. Due to the large form factor of the existing spectrophotometers, they cannot be used for live monitoring of the bacteria inside bacterial incubation chambers. Additionally, the use of benchtop spectrometers for continuous monitoring requires multiple samplings and is labor intensive. To overcome these challenges, we have developed an optical density measuring device (ODX) by modifying a generic fitness tracker. The resulting ODX device is an ultraportable and low-cost device that can be used inside bacterial incubators for real-time monitoring even while shaking is in progress. We evaluated the performance of ODX with different bacterial types and growth conditions and compared it with a commercial benchtop spectrophotometer. In all cases, ODX showed comparable performance to that of the standard benchtop spectrophotometer. Finally, we demonstrate a simple and useful smartphone application whereby the user is notified when the bacterial concentration reaches the targeted value. Due to its potential for automation and mass production, we believe that the ODX has a wide range of applications in biotechnology research and industry.","2019-10-01","2019-11-16 15:06:12","2019-11-16 15:06:12","2019-11-16 15:06:11","12329-12335","","19","91","","Anal.

The performance of RF estimation depends on the employed stimuli, the complexity of the encoded features, and the quality of the activity readout. Calcium imaging is an attractive readout method for high-throughput neuronal activity recordings. However, calcium recordings are oftentimes noisy and of low temporal resolution. The RF estimation of neurons sensitive to global motion is particularly challenging due to their potentially complex combination of preferred directions across visual field positions. New method Here, we present a novel noise stimulus, which is enriched with spatiotemporally contiguous motion and thus triggers robust calcium responses. We combined this contiguous motion noise (CMN) stimulus with reverse correlation followed by a two-step nonparametric cluster-based bootstrapping test for efficient and reliable RF estimation. Results The in silico evaluation of our approach showed that RF centre positions and preferred directions are reliably detected in most of the simulated neurons. Suppressive RF components were detected in 40% of the simulated neurons. We successfully applied our approach to estimate the RFs of 163 motion-sensitive neurons in vivo within 40 min in the pretectum of zebrafish. Many in vivo neurons were sensitive to elaborate directional flow fields in their RFs. Comparison with existing methods Our approach outperforms white noise methods and others due to the optimized motion stimulus statistics and ascertainable fine RF structures. Conclusions The CMN method enables efficient, non-biased RF estimation and will benefit systematic high-throughput investigations of RFs using calcium imaging.","2019-10-01","2019-11-16 15:07:03","2019-11-16 15:07:03","2019-11-16 15:07:03","108366","","","326","","Journal of Neuroscience Methods","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/7Y3M3RW4/Zhang and Arrenberg - 2019 - High throughput, rapid receptive field estimation .pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/I5HTE5K5/S0165027019302237.html","","","Calcium imaging; Direction-selective; Motion vision; Noise stimulus; Optic flow; Pretectum; Receptive field; Reverse correlation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this reason, presenting a controlled visual environment to tethered insects has been and continues to be a powerful tool for studying the sensory control of complex behaviors. To create an easily controlled, scalable, and customizable visual stimulus, we have designed a modular system, based on panels composed of an 8×8 array of individual LEDs, that may be connected together to ‘tile’ an experimental environment with controllable displays. The panels have been designed to be extremely bright, with the added flexibility of individual-pixel brightness control, allowing experimentation over a broad range of behaviorally relevant conditions. Patterns to be displayed may be designed using custom software, downloaded to a controller board, and displayed on the individually addressed panels via a rapid communication interface. The panels are controlled by a microprocessor-based display controller which, for most experiments, will not require a computer in the loop, greatly reducing the experimental infrastructure. This technology allows an experimenter to build and program a visual arena with a customized geometry in a matter of hours. To demonstrate the utility of this system, we present results from experiments with tethered Drosophila melanogaster: (1) in a cylindrical arena composed of 44 panels, used to test the contrast dependence of object orientation behavior, and (2) above a 30-panel floor display, used to examine the effects of ground motion on orientation during flight.","2008-01-30","2019-11-16 15:08:10","2019-11-16 15:08:10","2019-11-16 15:08:10","127-139","","2","167","","Journal of Neuroscience Methods","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/2AL8HJBJ/S0165027007003755.html","","","Optic flow; Flight control; Insect vision; Visually mediated behavior","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We demonstrate our scanner’s utility for natural imaging in both terrestrial and underwater environments. Our design provides sub-nm spectral resolution between 350–1000 nm, including the UV part of the light spectrum which has been mostly absent from commercial solutions and previous natural imaging studies. By comparing the full light spectra from natural scenes to the spectral sensitivity of animals, we show how our system can be used to identify subtle variations in chromatic details detectable by different species. In addition, we have created an open access database for hyperspectral datasets collected from natural scenes in the UK and India.

Since its discovery in 1976 by Neher and Sakmann, patch clamp has been instrumental in broadening our understanding of the fundamental properties of ion channels and synapses in neurons. The conventional patch-clamp method requires manual, precise positioning of a glass micropipette against the cell membrane of a visually identified target neuron. Subsequently, a tight “gigaseal” connection between the pipette and the cell membrane is established, and suction is applied to establish the whole cell patch configuration to perform electrophysiological recordings. This procedure is repeated manually for each individual cell, making it labor intensive and time consuming. In this article we describe the development of a new automatic patch-clamp system for brain slices, which integrates all steps of the patch-clamp process: image acquisition through a microscope, computer vision-based identification of a patch pipette and fluorescently labeled neurons, micromanipulator control, and automated patching. We validated our system in brain slices from wild-type and transgenic mice expressing channelrhodopsin 2 under the Thy1 promoter (line 18) or injected with a herpes simplex virus-expressing archaerhodopsin, ArchT. Our computer vision-based algorithm makes the fluorescent cell detection and targeting user independent. Compared with manual patching, our system is superior in both success rate and average trial duration. It provides more reliable trial-to-trial control of the patching process and improves reproducibility of experiments.","2016-07-06","2019-11-21 14:27:38","2019-11-21 14:27:38","2019-11-21 14:27:38","1564-1578","","4","116","","Journal of Neurophysiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","physiology.org (Atypon)","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/FN2U83XX/Wu (吴秋雨) et al. - 2016 - Integration of autopatching with automated pipette.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/ECUTV2NK/jn.00386.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We developed an autonomous robot that can acquire multiple consecutive patch-clamp recordings in vivo. In practice, 40 pipettes loaded into a carousel are sequentially filled and inserted into the brain, localized to a cell, used for patch clamping, and disposed. Automated visual stimulation and electrophysiology software enables functional cell-type classification of whole cell-patched cells, as we show for 37 cells in the anesthetized mouse in visual cortex (V1) layer 5.

However, a high level of skill is required to perform such microinjection and is a low-throughput and low-yield process. The automation of microinjection into cells in intact tissue would empower an increasing number of researchers to perform these challenging experiments and could potentially open up new avenues of experimentation. We have developed the ‘Autoinjector’, a robot that utilizes images acquired from a microscope to guide a microinjection needle into tissue to deliver femtoliter volumes of liquids into single cells. The robotic operation enables microinjection of hundreds of cells within a single organotypic slice, resulting in an overall yield that is an order of magnitude greater than manual microinjection. We validated the performance of the Autoinjector by microinjecting both apical progenitors (APs) and newborn neurons in the embryonic mouse telencephalon, APs in the embryonic mouse hindbrain, and neurons in fetal human brain tissue. We demonstrate the capability of the Autoinjector to deliver exogenous mRNA into APs. Further, we used the Autoinjector to systematically study gap-junctional communication between neural progenitors in the embryonic mouse telencephalon and found that apical contact is a characteristic feature of the cells that are part of a gap junction-coupled cell cluster. The throughput and versatility of the Autoinjector will not only render microinjection a broadly accessible high-performance cell manipulation technique but will also provide a powerful new platform for bioengineering and biotechnology for performing single-cell analyses in intact tissue.</p>","2018-11-29","2019-11-21 14:14:07","2019-11-21 14:14:07","2019-11-21 14:14:07","480004","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2018, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

Automating some of these procedures would not only enable more precise microsurgical operations, but also facilitate widespread use of advanced neurotechnologies. Here, we introduce the “Craniobot”, a cranial microsurgery platform that combines automated skull surface profiling with a computer numerical controlled (CNC) milling machine to perform a variety of cranial microsurgical procedures on mice. The Craniobot utilizes a low-force contact sensor to profile the skull surface and uses this information to perform precise milling operations within minutes. We have used the Craniobot to perform intact skull thinning and open small to large craniotomies over the dorsal cortex.","2019-01-31","2019-11-21 14:12:27","2019-11-21 14:12:47","2019-11-21 14:12:27","1-12","","1","9","","Sci Rep","Craniobot","","","","","","","en","2019 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/NMUCXC24/Ghanbari et al. - 2019 - Craniobot A computer numerical controlled robot f.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/YGX95LKZ/s41598-018-37073-w.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To alleviate these difficulties and to develop and share knowledge, the community needs open architecture frameworks for simulation, chip design, and software exploration that support extensibility, scalability, and configurability, alongside an established base of verification tools and supported software. In this article, we present OpenPiton, an open source framework for building scalable architecture research prototypes from one core to 500 million cores. OpenPiton is the world's first open source, general-purpose, multithreaded manycore processor, and framework. OpenPiton is highly configurable, providing a rich design space spanning a variety of hardware parameters that researchers can change. OpenPiton designs can be emulated on FPGAs, where they can run full-stack multiuser Debian Linux. OpenPiton is designed to scale to very large core fabrics, enabling researchers to measure operating system, compiler, and software scalability. The mature code-base reflects the complexity of an industrial-grade design and provides the necessary scripts to build new chips, making OpenPiton a natural choice for computer-aided design (CAD) research. OpenPiton has been validated with a 25-core chip prototype, named Piton, and is bolstered by a validation suite that has thousands of tests, providing an environment to test new hardware designs while verifying the correctness of the whole system. OpenPiton is being actively used in research both internally to Princeton and in the wider community, as well as being adopted in education, industry, and government settings.","2019-11","2019-11-28 22:49:12","2019-11-28 22:49:12","2019-11-28 22:49:11","79–87","","12","62","","","OpenPiton","","","","","","","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To overcome the aforementioned issues, our framework uses low-cost off-the-shelf hardware and applies to a variety of already available or self-crafted drones. To assess the usability of DronOS, we evaluate three drone programming modes: Unity Scripting, Vive Scripting, and Vive Realtime. We find that Vive Scripting required the least subjective workload in programming drone routines while Unity Scripting yielded the highest accuracy and Vive Realtime the least task completion time.

Although methods and protocols for tissue decellularization are abundant throughout the literature, they can be time intensive and typically require specific overhead in terms of equipment. To reduce these barriers to entry, a functional and reproducible prototype of a tissue infusion/perfusion device (TIPD) has been designed and fabricated using three-dimensional printed parts in conjunction with commercially available components. This TIPD forms a system composed of two peristaltic pumps, two 3-way valves, and a chamber in which tissue is contained, and is controlled by user-customizable software. To increase repeatability among decellularization protocols, an automation function has been integrated into the software, which is able to specify fluid flow rates and define specific valve locations enabling selection of solutions to be introduced into a scaffold over the course of a decellularization process. The prototype has been tested for proof of concept through infusion and perfusion decellularization of skeletal muscle and intact kidneys, respectively, and has shown successful removal of cellular content while maintaining an intact ultrastructure. In an effort to increase the reproducibility of experimental designs and to promote an open source hardware initiative in the field of tissue engineering, a novel device was conceptualized and prototyped with printable part files made available for its fabrication in tandem with instructions for assembly.Impact StatementRepeatable methods for decellularization are essential for achieving consistent substrates between batches, laboratories, and facilities. To meet this end, an automatable tissue infusion/perfusion device composed of three-dimensional printed parts and commercially available components has been prototyped and tested. Materials and instructions for its assembly have been made available in an effort to reduce variability among equipment as well as to provide a platform on which to iterate open-source hardware in tissue engineering.","2019-11-20","2019-11-28 23:01:19","2019-11-28 23:01:19","2019-11-28 23:01:19","","","","","","Tissue Engineering Part A","","","","","","","","","","","","","liebertpub.com (Atypon)","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/GHVW79QL/ten.tea.2019.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The nascent field of bio-geoengineering stands to benefit from synthetic biologists’ efforts to standardise, and in so doing democratise, biomolecular research methods. Roseobacter clade bacteria comprise 15–20% of oceanic bacterio-plankton communities, making them a prime candidate for establishment of synthetic biology chassis for bio-geoengineering activities such as bioremediation of oceanic waste plastic. Developments such as the increasing affordability of DNA synthesis and laboratory automation continue to foster the establishment of a global ‘do-it-yourself’ research community alongside the more traditional arenas of academe and industry. As a collaborative group of citizen, student and professional scientists we sought to test the following hypotheses: (i) that an incubator capable of cultivating bacterial cells can be constructed entirely from non-laboratory items, (ii) that marine bacteria from the Roseobacter clade can be established as a genetically tractable synthetic biology chassis using plasmids conforming to the BioBrickTM standard and finally, (iii) that identifying and subcloning genes from a Roseobacter clade species can readily by achieved by citizen scientists using open source cloning and bioinformatic tools. Method. We cultivated three Roseobacter species, Roseobacter denitrificans, Oceanobulbus indolifexand Dinoroseobacter shibae. For each species we measured chloramphenicol sensitivity, viability over 11 weeks of glycerol-based cryopreservation and tested the effectiveness of a series of electroporation and heat shock protocols for transformation using a variety of plasmid types. We also attempted construction of an incubator-shaker device using only publicly available components. Finally, a subgroup comprising citizen scientists designed and attempted a procedure for isolating the cold resistance anf1 gene from Oceanobulbus indolifexcells and subcloning it into a BioBrickTM formatted plasmid. Results. All species were stable over 11 weeks of glycerol cryopreservation, sensitive to 17 µg/mL chloramphenicol and resistant to transformation using the conditions and plasmids tested. An incubator-shaker device, ‘UCLHack-12’ was assembled and used to cultivate sufficient quantity of Oceanobulbus indolifexcells to enable isolation of the anf1 gene and its subcloning into a plasmid to generate the BioBrickTM BBa_K729016. Conclusion.The process of ‘de-skilling’ biomolecular techniques, particularly for relatively under-investigated organisms, is still on-going. However, our successful cell growth and DNA manipulation experiments serve to indicate the types of capabilities that are now available to citizen scientists. Science democratised in this way can make a positive contribution to the debate around the use of bio-geoengineering to address oceanic pollution or climate change.","2016-07-07","2019-11-29 18:26:39","2019-11-29 18:26:39","2019-11-29 18:26:39","e2031","","","4","","PeerJ","","","","","","","","en","","","","","peerj.com","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/FNXGRGBC/Borg et al. - 2016 - Open source approaches to establishing Roseobacter.pdf; /home/andre/Zotero/storage/HWPEXX6L/2031.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent changes in the climate and extent of the sea ice, together with increased economic activity and research interest in these regions, are driving factors for new measurements of sea ice dynamics. Waves in ice are important as they participate in the coupling between the open ocean and the ice-covered regions. Measurements are challenging to perform due to remoteness and harsh environmental conditions. While progress has been made in observing wave propagation in sea ice using remote methods, these are still relatively new measurements and would benefit from more in situ data for validation. In this article, we present an open source instrument that was developed for performing such measurements. The versatile design includes an ultra-low power unit, a microcontroller-based logger, a small microcomputer for on-board data processing, and an Iridium modem for satellite communications. Virtually any sensor can be used with this design. In the present case, we use an Inertial Motion Unit to record wave motion. High quality results were obtained, which opens new possibilities for in situ measurements in the polar regions. Our instrument can be easily customized to fit many in situ measurement tasks, and we hope that our work will provide a framework for future developments of a variety of such open source instruments.","2020-02-01","2019-12-01 19:27:33","2019-12-01 19:27:33","2019-12-01 19:27:33","102955","","","170","","Cold Regions Science and Technology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/andre/Zotero/storage/DIA8FW6I/S0165232X19300230.html","","","In situ measurements; Open Source instrument; Waves in ice","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For a visually impaired student, it is very difficult to write the molecule arrangements, balance chemical equations, and grasp the knowledge of valence electrons available for bonding and interactions. It is important to provide such students an easy way to understand their formation and manipulation. Emerging technologies like three-dimensional (3D) printing enable us to provide such methods which can help us create working modular molecular and chemical models for tactile perception. The provided scalable models can be readily printed as per the quantity required, to aid sighted learners and blind or low-vision (BLV) learners so that they can learn, understand, and represent elemental and molecular reactions. All the provided models are scalable and identified with Braille labels along with alphanumerical impressions. Further, we have conducted a small survey using the newly created models with BLV learners, and the students responses are also reported here.","2019-11-25","2019-12-01 19:32:01","2019-12-01 19:32:01","2019-12-01 19:32:01","","","","","","J.

Therefore, there is a need to demonstrate the applicability of those techniques with consumer grade instrument. Furthermore, routine monitoring would benefit from a wireless PCG sensor that allows continuous monitoring of cardiac signals of patients in physical activity, e.g., treadmill or weight exercise. In this work, a low-cost portable and wireless healthcare monitoring system based on PCG signal is implemented to validate and evaluate the most advanced algorithms. Off-the-shelf electronics and a notebook PC are used with MATLAB codes to record and analyze PCG signals which are collected with a notebook computer in tethered and wireless mode.
