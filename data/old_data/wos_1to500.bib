Abstract = {{Synthetic biology emerged in the USA and Europe twenty years ago and
   quickly developed innovative research and technology as a result of
   continued funding. Synthetic biology is also growing in many developing
   countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America, where it could have a large
   economic impact by helping its use of genetic biodiversity in order to
   boost existing industries. Starting in 2011, Argentine synthetic biology
   developed along an idiosyncratic path. In 2011-2012, the main focus was
   not exclusively research but also on community building through teaching
   and participation in iGEM, following the template of the early ``MIT
   school{''} of synthetic biology. In 2013-2015, activities diversified
   and included society-centered projects, social science studies on
   synthetic biology and bioart. Standard research outputs such as articles
   and industrial applications helped consolidate several academic working
   groups. Since 2016, the lack of a critical mass of researchers and a
   funding crisis were partially compensated by establishing links with
   Latin American synthetic biologists and with other socially oriented
   open technology collectives. The TECNOx community is a central node in
   this growing research and technology network. The first four annual
   TECNOx meetings brought together synthetic biologists with other open
   science and engineering platforms and explored the relationship of Latin
   American technologies with entrepreneurship, open hardware, ethics and
   human rights. In sum, the socioeconomic context encouraged Latin
   American synthetic biology to develop in a meandering and diversifying
   manner. This revealed alternative ways for growth of the field that may
   be relevant to other developing countries.}},

Title = {{Time-dependent enhancement of fluorescence from Rhodobacter capsulatus
   SB1003 and its critical dependence on concentration temperature and
   static magnetic field}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL PHYSICS}},
Abstract = {{Continuous exposure of 395 nm light increases the fluorescence emission
   intensity of photosynthetic purple non-sulphur bacteria, Rhodobacter
   capsulatus (SB1003). We show that such an increase in fluorescence
   emission of extracellular pigment complexes (PC) from these
   photosynthetic bacteria depends on the concentration of the pigment and
   temperature and can also be modulated by the static magnetic field. The
   time-dependent enhanced emission disappears either at or below 300 K or
   below a threshold sample concentration (0.1 mg/ml). The enhanced
   emission reappears at this condition (T < 278 K) if a static magnetic
   field (395 mT) is introduced during fluorescence measurement. The time
   dependence of emission is expressed in terms of a first-order rate
   constant, k = dF/(Fdt). The sign of k shifts from positive to negative
   as PC concentration is lowered than a threshold value, implying onset of
   fluorescence decay (k < 0) rather than amplification (k > 0). At PC
   concentration higher than a threshold, k becomes negative if the
   temperature is lowered. But, surprisingly, at low temperature, a static
   magnetic field reverts the k value to positive. We explain the logical
   nature of k-switching and photo-dynamics of the aforesaid microbial
   fluorescence emission by aggregation of protoporphyrin rings present in
   the PC. While the simultaneous presence of decay in fluorescence and
   susceptibility to static magnetic field suggests the dominance of
   triplet states at low temperatures, the process is reversed by
   SMF-induced removal of spin degeneracy. At higher temperatures, the
   optical excitability and lack of magnetic response suggest the dominance
   of singlet states. We propose that the restructuring of the
   singlet-triplet distribution by intersystem crossing may be the basis of
   this logical behaviour. In context with microbial function,
   time-dependent enhancement of fluorescence also implies relay of red
   photons to the neighbouring microbes not directly exposed to the
   incident radiation, thus serving as an indirect photosynthetic
   regulator.}},

Title = {{VersaVIS-An Open Versatile Multi-Camera Visual-Inertial Sensor Suite}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Robust and accurate pose estimation is crucial for many applications in
   mobile robotics. Extending visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
   (SLAM) with other modalities such as an inertial measurement unit (IMU)
   can boost robustness and accuracy. However, for a tight sensor fusion,
   accurate time synchronization of the sensors is often crucial. Changing
   exposure times, internal sensor filtering, multiple clock sources and
   unpredictable delays from operation system scheduling and data transfer
   can make sensor synchronization challenging. In this paper, we present
   VersaVIS, an Open Versatile Multi-Camera Visual-Inertial Sensor Suite
   aimed to be an efficient research platform for easy deployment,
   integration and extension for many mobile robotic applications. VersaVIS
   provides a complete, open-source hardware, firmware and software bundle
   to perform time synchronization of multiple cameras with an IMU
   featuring exposure compensation, host clock translation and independent
   and stereo camera triggering. The sensor suite supports a wide range of
   cameras and IMUs to match the requirements of the application. The
   synchronization accuracy of the framework is evaluated on multiple
   experiments achieving timing accuracy of less than <mml:semantics>1
   ms</mml:semantics>. Furthermore, the applicability and versatility of
   the sensor suite is demonstrated in multiple applications including
   visual-inertial SLAM, multi-camera applications, multi-modal mapping,
   reconstruction and object based mapping.}},

Title = {{Lightweight sustainable intelligent load forecasting platform for smart
   grid applications}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABLE COMPUTING-INFORMATICS \& SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{25}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{With the global electricity demand witnessing a 3.1 percent jump in
   2017, there is an increasing need for incorporating intermittent
   renewable energy sources and other alternative supply/demand management
   strategies into the supply grid networks. Short-term load forecasting
   models enable prediction of future power consumption, thereby
   encouraging shifting of loads and optimizing the use of stochastic power
   sources and stored energy. To make the electric grid system smart and
   sustainable, two-way communication between the utility and consumers
   must be set up and the working equipment must respond digitally to the
   quickly changing electric demand. The proposed work exploits the power
   of embedded systems to design a low-cost solution for interconnecting
   electrical and electronic devices, controlled by the intelligent
   Internet of Things (IoT) paradigms. This work primarily focuses on
   implementing standard regression and machine learning-based
   architectures for smart grid load analysis and forecasting. A state of
   the art ecosystem for a portable load forecasting device is proposed by
   means of low-cost, open-source hardware that is experimentally found to
   be functioning with a high degree of accuracy. Further, the performance
   of the classical and advanced machine learning models, emulated on the
   device, are analyzed on the basis of various parameters, including error
   percentage, execution time, CPU core temperatures, and resource
   utilization. Overall impressive performance is demonstrated by some
   specific machine learning models which are considered to be suitable for
   the proposed framework. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An open-source syringe pump has been developed for use in the analytical
   laboratory. Most pump parts are made on a 3D printer. Other parts (lead
   screw, guide rods, stepper motor, bearings, electronic components) are
   purchased in specialized stores. The control panel is based on the
   Arduino UNO. Device interaction, any settings changes, and operating
   mode selection are carried out using the LCD Keypad Shield (no computer
   connection required). The program for the microcontroller is written in
   Arduino IDE. Assembling the syringe pump takes several hours and
   requires almost no soldering. Universal clamp allows installing any
   syringe with a diameter of 6 to 25 mm. The syringe pump can both infuse
   the liquid and refill the empty syringe. To evaluate the analytical
   characteristics, a 10-mL glass syringe (Kloehn) was used. The dispensed
   volume was 1 and 5 mL. The systematic error was less than 0.1\%, and the
   random one was less than 3 mu L. Project files are available at:

Abstract = {{The founding of the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS) vision was
   originally presented in U.S. Geological Survey Circular 1188 (U.S.
   Geological Survey {[}USGS], 1999), after many years of discussions and
   workshops, described in detail by Filson and Arabasz (2016). Much has
   been accomplished in the ensuing two decades. Disparate and sometimes
   divergent developments that had been previously explored at individual
   private and public universities were finally centralized with increased
   efficiency and coherency of effort. The stated mission of the ANSS is to
   ``... provide accurate and timely data and information products for
   seismic events, including their effects on buildings and structures,
   employing modern monitoring methods and technologies.{''} In this
   article, an approach (xQuake) is proposed that does not interfere in any
   way with the mission of the National Earthquake Information Center and
   ANSS but instead restores much of the community focus and international
   collaboration that has been lost over the past two decades. xQuake uses
   an executable graph framework in a pipeline architecture; this framework
   can be seamlessly integrated into current ANSS quake monitoring systems.
   This newapproach incorporatesmodern approaches to computer analytics,
   including multitopic Kafka exchange rings, cloud computing, a
   self-configuring phase associator, and machine learning. The xGraph
   system is free for noncommercial use, open source, hardware agnostic
   (Windows, Linux, Mac), with no requirement for commercial datastores.}},

Abstract = {{The control of refrigeration in the food chain is fundamental at all
   stages, with special emphasis on the retail stage. The implementation of
   information and communication technologies (IoT, open-source hardware

   solution, based on free hardware and software, for monitoring the
   temperature in refrigerated retail cabinets. Specifically, the use of
   the ESP-8266-Wi-Fi microcontroller with DS18B20 temperature sensors is
   proposed. The ThingSpeak IoT platform is used to store and process data
   in the cloud. The solution presented is robust, affordable, and
   flexible, allowing to extend the scope of supervising other relevant
   parameters in the operating process (light control, energy efficiency,
   consumer presence, etc.).}},

Month = {{JAN 29}},
Abstract = {{Phase microscopy allows stain-free imaging of transparent biological
   samples. One technique, using the transport of intensity equation (TIE),
   can be performed without dedicated hardware by simply processing pairs
   of images taken at known spacings within the sample. The resulting TIE
   images are quantitative phase maps of unstained biological samples.
   Therefore, spatially resolved optical path length (OPL) information can
   also be determined. Using low-cost, open-source hardware, we applied the
   TIE to living algal cells to measure their effect on OPL. We obtained
   OPL values that were repeatable within species and differed by distinct
   amounts depending on the species being measured. We suggest TIE imaging
   as a method of discrimination between different algal species and,
   potentially, non-biological materials, based on refractive index/OPL.
   Potential applications in biogeochemical modelling and climate sciences
   are suggested.}},

Abstract = {{The internet of things is rapidly becoming a fact of life. There remain,
   however, various challenges with respect to the concept of Industry 4.0
   before this new reality is fully integrated into the industrial sector.
   One such challenge is ensuring security, an essential issue in terms of
   both management and operational technology involving the configuration
   and administration of physical equipment. Another is integrating
   equipment from different manufacturers which must be configured and/or
   administered with incompatible protocols. Likewise, remote access to
   systems must be carried out from a browser in the web frame. This paper
   presents a set of tools, available as a cloud-based service, which
   facilitates access to the physical equipment located in a business. The
   access enables the end user to see and/or modify the configuration and
   management of data in a secure, controlled, organized and collaborative
   manner. In order to unify different protocols, the service makes use of
   the Modbus TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)
   protocol, one of the most commonly used by industry in local networks.
   The local Modbus communications are encapsulated in the Websocket
   protocol to make them accessible from the cloud. The tools proposed in
   this paper are based on open hardware platforms and free software, and
   they permit local and remote sensors and actuators to be fully and
   easily accessed. Hence, their chief advantage is that they allow access
   from any internet connection, via a browser, to the physical equipment
   located in an industry by means of user profiles in accordance with the
   security level set by each individual company.}},

Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {{14134-14145}},
Abstract = {{Open-source designs are being increasingly used to develop robot
   hardware. When motor actuators were used for robot development in the
   past, it was difficult to find cost-effective commercial products.
   Open-source motor controllers, recently developed with the collaboration
   of many people, have exhibited phenomenal growth as their performance is
   now comparable to those of commercial products and their price is
   cheaper. In this study, we utilized an open-source Vedder electronic
   speed controller (VESC), originally developed for electric skateboards,
   as a general-purpose motor controller for robot control. The high-speed,
   high-torque, and high-output VESC was hardware-upgraded to enable more
   accurate current control, and advanced position and speed control
   algorithms were developed to produce Myongji-VESC (MJ-VESC), a
   general-purpose motor controller for multiaxis robot systems. To
   evaluate its current, speed, and position control performances, MJ-VESC
   was applied to an open-source planetary geared actuator that can be
   fabricated with a 3D printer. Based on this, we propose an open-source
   motor controller framework that can be universally used for multiaxis
   robot systems.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advancements in whole slide imaging (WSI) have moved pathology
   closer to digital practice. Existing systems require precise mechanical
   control, and the cost is prohibitive for most individual pathologists.
   Here we report a low-cost and high-throughput WSI system termed OpenWSI.
   The reported system is built using off-the-shelf components, including a
   programmable LED array, a photographic lens, and a low-cost computer
   numerical control (CNC) router. Different from conventional WSI
   platforms, our system performs real-time single-frame autofocusing using
   color-multiplexed illumination. For axial positioning control, we
   perform coarse adjustment using the CNC router and precise adjustment
   using the ultrasonic motor ring in the photographic lens. By using a 20X
   objective lens, we show that the OpenWSI system has a resolution of
   similar to 0.7 mu m. It can acquire whole slide images of a 225 mm(2)
   region in similar to 2 mins with throughput comparable to existing
   high-end platforms. The reported system offers a turnkey solution to
   transform the high-end WSI platforms into one that can be made broadly
   available and utilizable without loss of capacity. (C) 2019 Optical

Pages = {{75-95}},

Abstract = {{Open source software (OSS) and hardware (OSH) are two expressions of one
   broader concept and its related movement. One of the most fundamental
   questions relating to these phenomena is why developers contribute their
   private resources to these public goods. While this question has been
   discussed, theorized, and empirically investigated in the context of
   OSS, there has been no research so far in the context of OSH. Can we
   really assume the motivations behind the development of the OSH to be
   the same as those behind OSS? Based on the self-determination theory
   (SDT), we provide original insights into the motivations behind
   contributions to OSH development. We collected data from the most common
   and active 3D printing communities, which are the main loci of OSH
   development. We thus have a unique cross-sectional data set with
   participants from over 30 different countries using all kinds of
   different OSH platforms. Our analysis reveals several important
   findings: firstly, the motivations are in some aspects very similar to
   those in open source software notwithstanding different possibilities,
   hurdles, and incentives regarding the OSS and OSH. Above all,
   enjoyment-based intrinsic motivation is a major factor affecting
   contribution levels. Secondly, among internalized extrinsic motivations,
   expected private benefits through improving own skills stands out.
   Thirdly, different factors of internalized extrinsic motivations can
   have different moderating effects on the effect of enjoyment-based
   intrinsic motivation. Given the imminent changes in business models
   throughout manufacturing industries in order to adapt to the challenge
   that OSH will increasingly pose, our findings have important
   implications not only for OSH communities and 3D development platforms,

Title = {{Open LabBot and RmsiGUI: Community development kit for sampling
   automation and ambient imaging}},
Journal = {{MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{152}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Building novel analytical systems requires various elements: Sensors, a
   sampling system and data evaluation software. For emerging technologies,
   such as ambient ionization mass spectrometry (AIMS), the assembly of a
   functional prototype is often more time-consuming than developing the
   actual probes. The modification of commercial platforms for testing
   hardware is usually not possible due to technical and legal
   restrictions. Therefore, we designed a robotic platform, which is based
   on RepRap 3D-printer components, and therefore easy to adopt for custom
   set-ups. Adjustable rails in an aluminium frame construction facilitate
   the mounting of additional parts such as sensors, probes, or optical
   components. The Open LabBot uses industry-standard G-code for its
   control. Its simple syntax facilitates the programming of the movement.
   We developed two programs for the robot control and mass spectrometry
   imaging: ``LABI-Imaging{''} for synchronizing the robot movements and MS
   data acquisition and ``RmsiGUI{''}, a software solution for the complete
   AIMS workflow. We proved the functionality of the system by the
   automated sampling and classification of essential oils with a
   PlasmaChip probe. Further, we performed an AIMSI imaging experiment of a
   lime slice with laser desorption low-temperature plasma (LD-LTP)
   ionization, demonstrating the integration of the complete workflow in
   RmsiGUI. The design of the Open LabBot and the software are released
   under open licenses to promote their use and adoption in the instrument
   developers' community.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{279}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{The LI-COR 6400 portable photosynthesis system is the most widely used
   and cited instrument for measuring leaf gas exchange in plant
   physiology. The focus of this paper is to evaluate three ways of
   computing/measuring leaf temperature: the LI-COR energy budget
   computation, the LI-COR leaf thermocouple (T/C), and an infra-red (IR)
   sensor chip (MLX90615) incorporated into the LI-6400 leaf chamber. The
   IR-sensor was calibrated against known targets, and then used to cross
   check the other two methods. The results showed that the IR-sensor was
   superior to the LI-COR thermocouple and agreed closer with the energy
   budget values of leaf temperature. The magnitudes of the errors were
   quantified in terms of degrees C difference in leaf temperature measured
   by T/C (as control) and IR sensor versus percentage difference in
   stomatal conductance (g(s)) and intercellular CO2 concentration (C-i)
   computed from leaf temperature. The temperature difference (IR versus
   other methods) in the range of -1.89 to 1.58 degrees C resulted in
   relative errors in g(s) from 14.7\% to -18.0\% and C-i from 16.5\% to
   -7.8\% of the values reported by the standard LI-6400 calculations
   depending on species and temperature. Reasons are given for trusting the
   IR-sensor over the other methods and it is suggested that the next
   generation LI-COR photosynthesis system include an IR-sensor.}},

Title = {{Open Source Waste Plastic Granulator}},
Journal = {{TECHNOLOGIES}},
Year = {{2019}},

Abstract = {{In order to accelerate deployment of distributed recycling by providing
   low-cost feed stocks of granulated post-consumer waste plastic, this
   study analyzes an open source waste plastic granulator system. It is
   designed, built, and tested for its ability to convert post-consumer
   waste, 3D printed products and waste into polymer feedstock for
   recyclebots of fused particle/granule printers. The technical
   specifications of the device are quantified in terms of power
   consumption (380 to 404 W for PET and PLA, respectively) and particle
   size distribution. The open source device can be fabricated for less
   than \$2000 USD in materials. The experimentally measured power use is
   only a minor contribution to the overall embodied energy of distributed
   recycling of waste plastic. The resultant plastic particle size
   distributions were found to be appropriate for use in both recyclebots
   and direct material extrusion 3D printers. Simple retrofits are shown to
   reduce sound levels during operation by 4dB-5dB for the vacuum. These
   results indicate that the open source waste plastic granulator is an
   appropriate technology for community, library, maker space, fab lab, or
   small business-based distributed recycling.}},

Abstract = {{As conventional fluorescence microscopy and confocal laser scanning
   microscopy generally produce images with blurring at the upper and lower
   planes along the z-axis due to non-focal plane image information, the
   observation of biological images requires ``deconvolution.{''}
   Therefore, a microscope system's individual blur function (point spread
   function) is determined theoretically or by actual measurement of
   microbeads and processed mathematically to reduce noise and eliminate
   blurring as much as possible. Here the author describes the use of
   open-source software and open hardware design to build a deconvolution
   microscope at low cost, using readily available software and hardware.
   The advantage of this method is its cost-effectiveness and ability to
   construct a microscope system using commercially available optical
   components and open-source software. Although this system does not
   utilize expensive equipment, such as confocal and total internal
   reflection fluorescence microscopes, decent images can be obtained even
   without previous experience in electronics and optics.}},

Abstract = {{Industry is building larger, more complex, manycore processors on the
   back of strong institutional knowledge, but academic projects face
   difficulties in replicating that scale. To alleviate these difficulties
   and to develop and share knowledge, the community needs open
   architecture frameworks for simulation, chip design, and software
   exploration that support extensibility, scalability, and
   configurability, alongside an established base of verification tools and
   supported software. In this article, we present OpenPiton, an open
   source framework for building scalable architecture research prototypes
   from one core to 500 million cores. OpenPiton is the world's first open
   source, general-purpose, multithreaded manycore processor, and
   framework. OpenPiton is highly configurable, providing a rich design
   space spanning a variety of hardware parameters that researchers can
   change. OpenPiton designs can be emulated on FPGA5, where they can run
   full-stack multiuser Debian Linux. OpenPiton is designed to scale to
   very large core fabrics, enabling researchers to measure operating
   system, compiler, and software scalability. The mature code-base
   reflects the complexity of an industrial-grade design and provides the
   necessary scripts to build new chips, making OpenPiton a natural choice
   for computer-aided design (CAD) research. OpenPiton has been validated
   with a 25-core chip prototype, named Piton, and is bolstered by a
   validation suite that has thousands of tests, providing an environment
   to test new hardware designs while verifying the correctness of the
   whole system. OpenPiton is being actively used in research both
   internally to Princeton and in the wider community, as well as being
   adopted in education, industry, and government settings.}},

Title = {{Integration of open source hardware Arduino platform in automation

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Large scale deployment of Smart Grids (SGs) and Smart Micro-Grids (SMGs)
   requires overcoming problems related to interoperability and high costs.
   To automate and monitor these challenging infrastructures, industrial
   equipment is used due to their reliability and versatility. In
   particular, Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are the prevalent
   automation units devoted to process control. They are combined with
   Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, responsible of
   acquiring and displaying operational data. One of the prominent trends
   to facilitate such deployment is the open source movement, being the
   Arduino microcontroller one of the most illustrative examples. This
   low-cost and community-supported platform is achieving increasing
   attention from academy and industry. However, there is still a need of
   integration frameworks to combine this device with reliable industrial
   equipment. This paper presents an approach that seamlessly integrates
   PLCs and Arduino platforms into a common SCADA system using the
   connectivity provided by Open Platform Communications (OPC). The open
   source device is devoted to sensing tasks. As a proof of concept, an
   application case has been carried out within the automation system of an
   experimental SMG, where the temperature of a PV panel is sensed and
   monitored. The developed system is described and successful results are
   reported.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue decellularization for generating extracellular matrices has
   become a staple of regenerative medicine in the recent decades,
   extending from the research setting to clinical usage. Although methods
   and protocols for tissue decellularization are abundant throughout the
   literature, they can be time intensive and typically require specific
   overhead in terms of equipment. To reduce these barriers to entry, a
   functional and reproducible prototype of a tissue infusion/perfusion
   device (TIPD) has been designed and fabricated using three-dimensional
   printed parts in conjunction with commercially available components.
   This TIPD forms a system composed of two peristaltic pumps, two 3-way
   valves, and a chamber in which tissue is contained, and is controlled by
   user-customizable software. To increase repeatability among
   decellularization protocols, an automation function has been integrated
   into the software, which is able to specify fluid flow rates and define
   specific valve locations enabling selection of solutions to be
   introduced into a scaffold over the course of a decellularization
   process. The prototype has been tested for proof of concept through
   infusion and perfusion decellularization of skeletal muscle and intact
   kidneys, respectively, and has shown successful removal of cellular
   content while maintaining an intact ultrastructure. In an effort to
   increase the reproducibility of experimental designs and to promote an
   open source hardware initiative in the field of tissue engineering, a
   novel device was conceptualized and prototyped with printable part files
   made available for its fabrication in tandem with instructions for
   assembly. Impact Statement Repeatable methods for decellularization are
   essential for achieving consistent substrates between batches,
   laboratories, and facilities. To meet this end, an automatable tissue
   infusion/perfusion device composed of three-dimensional printed parts
   and commercially available components has been prototyped and tested.
   Materials and instructions for its assembly have been made available in
   an effort to reduce variability among equipment as well as to provide a
   platform on which to iterate open-source hardware in tissue engineering.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an intelligent electronic device (IED) utilized for

   This IED is utilized to measure a low-voltage intelligent electronic
   device) system with a boundless number of sensors, and it is accessible
   on the Internet of Things (IoT). The utilized equipment for this task is
   Arduino UNO R3 motherboard and fringe sensors, which are used for
   measurement of the referenced information. The Arduino motherboard is
   used not only for sole tranquility of equipment but also for serving as
   wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) switch for the sensors. The personal computer
   is utilized to gather information and perform client-side calculations.
   The server works based on an open-source program written in Java
   programming language. The underlying objective of the proposed scheme is
   to make the meter based on the ``Do It Yourself{''} methodology which
   requires considerably fewer funds. Also, it is conceivable by keeping
   easy to understand interface, information legitimacy, precision of
   measured information and convenience for the conclusive client. The
   information is measured in just about 1 ms which is superb for
   custom-designed IED. Furthermore, the measured qualities are calculated
   based on their RMS values to be used for analyzing and further
   presentation of data.}},

Abstract = {{Physiological sensors can be used to detect changes in the emotional
   state of users with affective computing. This has lately been applied in
   the educational domain, aimed to better support learners during the
   learning process. For this purpose, we have developed the AICARP
   (Ambient Intelligence Context-aware Affective Recommender Platform)
   infrastructure, which detects changes in the emotional state of the user
   and provides personalized multisensorial support to help manage the
   emotional state by taking advantage of ambient intelligence features. We
   have developed a third version of this infrastructure, AICARP.V3, which
   addresses several problems detected in the data acquisition stage of the
   second version, (i.e., intrusion of the pulse sensor, poor resolution
   and lowsignal to noise ratio in the galvanic skin response sensor and
   slow response time of the temperature sensor) and extends the
   capabilities to integrate new actuators. This improved incorporates a
   new acquisition platform(shield) called PhyAS (Physiological Acquisition
   Shield), which reduces the number of control units to only one, and
   supports both gathering physiological signalswith better precision and
   delivering multisensory feedback with more flexibility, by means of new
   actuators that can be added/discarded on top of just that single shield.
   The improvements in the quality of the acquired signals allow better
   recognition of the emotional states. Thereof, AICARP.V3 gives a more
   accurate personalized emotional support to the user, based on a
   rule-based approach that triggers multisensorial feedback, if necessary.
   This represents progress in solving an open problem: develop systems
   that perform as effectively as a human expert in a complex task such as
   the recognition of emotional states.}},

Abstract = {{Heart rate data are often collected in human factors studies, including
   those into vehicle automation. Advances in open hardware platforms and
   off-the-shelf photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensors allow the non-intrusive
   collection of heart rate data at very low cost. However, the signal is
   not trivial to analyse, since the morphology of PPG waveforms differs
   from electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms and shows different noise
   patterns. Few validated open source available algorithms exist that
   handle PPG data well, as most of these algorithms are specifically
   designed for ECG data.
   In this paper we present the validation of a novel algorithm named
   HeartPy, useful for the analysis of heart rate data collected in noisy
   settings, such as when driving a car or when in a simulator. We
   benchmark the performance on two types of datasets and show that the
   developed algorithm performs well. Further research steps are discussed.

Abstract = {{In order to provide dynamic adaptation of the performance/energy
   tradeoff, systems today rely on heterogeneous multicore architectures
   (different micro-architectures on a chip). These systems are limited to
   single-ISA approaches to enable transparent migration between the
   different cores. To offer more tradeoff, we can integrate statically
   scheduled micro-architecture and use dynamic binary translation (DBT)
   for task migration. However, in a system where performance and energy
   consumption are a prime concern, the translation overhead has to be kept
   as low as possible. In this paper, we present Hybrid-DBT, an
   open-source, hardware accelerated DBT system targeting VLIW cores. Three
   different hardware accelerators have been designed to speed-up critical
   steps of the translation process. Experimental study shows that the
   accelerated steps are two orders of magnitude faster than their software
   equivalent. The impact on the total execution time of applications and
   the quality of generated binaries are also measured.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the rapid increase in the elderly population and single-person

   of marginalized people, such as the elderly or the disabled, to detect
   abnormal conditions. At this time, contact sensors are have limited

   develop technology to collect daily life activities of the elderly. In
   this study, we tried to track the elderly living alone using images
   obtained from an open source camera. The system captures images by
   linking a low-cost camera module to open source hardware, and an
   algorithm is implemented to detect falls. This system can be used to
   reduce the cost of social care by improving the cost of care in the
   aging population, and this will contribute to promoting and developing

Abstract = {{Quality assurance detectors comprising cameras and a scintillator volume
   are of interest for use in spot scanning proton therapy due to its
   dynamic delivery. In this work, we aimed to image scanned proton beams
   with greater flexibility than is provided by previous systems by using
   an innovative camera triggering solution. The main objective was to
   synchronize image acquisitions with proton beam deliveries. A 3D
   detector composed of 3 scientific complementary
   metal-oxide-semiconductor cameras and a volumetric liquid scintillator
   (20 x20x 20 cm) were used. We identified relevant signals from the
   synchrotron beam delivery system to trigger the cameras. These signals
   were processed using an open hardware microcontroller and monitored
   using an oscilloscope. We evaluated the camera triggering scheme by
   comparing the mean signal intensity and standard deviations for
   triggered versus non-triggered image acquisitions at 5 energies (161.6,
   140.9, 124.0, 100.9, and 85.6 MeV) with 50 spots per energy. The
   performance of the triggering scheme was further investigated by testing
   the image intensity variability for 5 energies delivered at 9 different
   location (2 spots/location). We also measured the background signals for
   different exposure times (1-1000 ms) using both triggered and
   non-triggered schemes. The mean signal intensity difference between
   triggered and non-triggered schemes was 10\% +/- 0.4\% for low SNR
   (similar to 20 dB). The image intensity variability was within 2\%. The
   background signal intensity varied by only 0.6\% from the shortest
   exposure time (1 ms) to the longest (1 s). We demonstrated a flexible
   triggering scheme using an open hardware microcontroller with a camera
   and scintillator detector system for a spot scanning proton beam, which
   will enable efficient machine quality assurance and treatment plan
   verification measurements in the future.}},

Abstract = {{This work demonstrates an open-source hardware and software platform for
   monitoring the performance of buildings, called Elemental, that is
   designed to provide data on indoor environmental quality, energy usage,
   HVAC operation, and other factors to its users. It combines: (i) custom
   printed circuit boards (PCBs) with RFM69 frequency shift keying (FSK)
   radio frequency (RF) transceivers for wireless sensors, control nodes,
   and USB gateway, (ii) a Raspberry Pi 3B with custom firmware acting as
   either a centralized or distributed backhaul, and (iii) a custom
   dockerized application for the backend called Brood that serves as the
   director software managing message brokering via Message Queuing
   Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol using VerneMQ, database storage
   using InfluxDB, and data visualization using Grafana. The platform is
   built around the idea of a private, secure, and open technology for the
   built environment. Among its many applications, the platform allows
   occupants to investigate anomalies in energy usage, environmental
   quality, and thermal performance via a comprehensive dashboard with rich
   querying capabilities. It also includes multiple frontends to view and
   analyze building activity data, which can be used directly in building
   controls or to provide recommendations on how to increase operational
   efficiency or improve operating conditions. Here, we demonstrate three
   distinct applications of the Elemental platform, including: (1)
   deployment in a research lab for long-term data collection and automated
   analysis, (2) use as a full-home energy and environmental monitoring
   solution, and (3) fault and anomaly detection and diagnostics of
   individual building systems at the zone-level. Through these
   applications we demonstrate that the platform allows easy and virtually
   unlimited datalogging, monitoring, and analysis of real-time sensor data
   with low setup costs. Low-power sensor nodes placed in abundance in a
   building can also provide precise and immediate fault-detection,

Abstract = {{This study reports on the results of a systematic literature review on
   `open design' in academic fields including and beyond design and HCI.
   The review investigates how studies are framed as open design and
   open-source design (including `open hardware'): how researchers
   contribute to conceptual theorizing about open design or study its
   practical operationalization, in do-it-yourself `making,' manufacturing
   and practices in-between these domains. Most of the papers reviewed were
   empirical studies from diverse fields. Open design was analyzed not only
   as contributions and solutions, but also as open-to-participate
   processes, openly shared processes, and open, closed, and modular (open
   and closed) outcomes. Various research fields presented an open design
   framing as an alternative to the status quo: new ways to do business
   and/or to foster socio-environmental sustainability. On the
   manufacturing side, open design was sought especially to accelerate
   innovation cycles; on the making side, it was espoused to foster
   democratization. However, the studies reviewed indicated that companies
   do not appear to develop much beyond business-as-usual. From the
   research perspective, the conceptual potential of open design to promote
   sustainability saw little practical exploration. Additionally, issues
   around open design community governance and ownership, safety and
   reliability of open outcomes require further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Open Design is an emerging area of research that seeks to connect and
   extend the culture of making, social innovation, open-source software,
   and open-source hardware. A cornerstone for Open Design is to broaden
   participation in technology innovation by allowing people to use and
   contribute to publicly shared resources. Makerspaces are important
   access points to share and contribute to these resources. However, prior
   to entering the physical door of a makerspace, makerspaces' social media
   presence serve as the `front door' for Open Design activities. In this
   paper, we examine different `front doors' of Open Design, asking: What
   are the characteristics that produce makerspaces' social media
   presences, and how do these representations shape potential access to
   Open Design activities? We manually collected and qualitatively analyzed
   500 public posts on the Facebook sites of five makerspaces in
   Copenhagen, Denmark. By choosing the same geographical area, we were
   able to explore the characteristics of makerspaces' social media
   presences for the same potential population of Open Design participants.
   Our analysis identifies three main characteristics of makerspaces'
   social media presence, which together shape access to Open Design
   activities, namely reach, transparency, and discourse. The display of
   these characteristics produce openness and availability in unique ways,
   and is constitutive for how Open Design activities are produced online.
   In this paper, we do not argue for or against specific social media
   representations. Instead, we argue that the specificities and
   differences between makerspaces' social media presences in the same
   geographical region have the strength of producing different identities
   across spaces, allowing for a broader definition and potential
   participation in Open Design.}},

Title = {{An Open-Source, Automated Home-Cage Sipper Device for Monitoring Liquid
   Ingestive Behavior in Rodents}},
Journal = {{ENEURO}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{Measuring ingestive behavior of liquids in rodents is commonly used in
   studies of reward, metabolism, and circadian biology. Common approaches
   for measuring liquid intake in real time include computer-tethered
   lickometers or video-based systems. Additionally, liquids can be
   measured or weighed to determine the amount consumed without real-time
   sensing. Here, we built a photobeam-based sipper device that has the
   following advantages over traditional methods: (1) it is battery powered
   and fits in vivarium caging to allow home-measurements; (2) it
   quantifies the intake of two different liquids simultaneously for
   preference studies; (3) it is low cost and easily constructed, enabling
   high-throughput experiments; and (4) it is open source so that others
   can modify it to fit their experimental needs. We validated the
   performance of this device in three experiments. First, we calibrated
   our device using time-lapse video-based measurements of liquid intake
   and correlated sipper interactions with liquid intake. Second, we used
   the sipper device to measure preference for water versus chocolate milk,
   demonstrating its utility for two-bottle choice tasks. Third, we
   integrated the device with fiber photometry, establishing its utility
   for measuring neural activity in studies of ingestive behavior. This
   device requires no special equipment or caging, and is small, battery
   powered, and wireless, allowing it to be placed directly in rodent home
   cages. The total cost of fabrication is less than \$100, and all design
   files and code are open source. Together, these factors greatly increase
   scalability and utility for a variety of behavioral neuroscience
   applications.}},

   view of two main concepts: conviviality and openness. The aim is to
   provide an in-depth understanding of the relationship between these two
   aspects and the literature regarding Design Global Manufacture Local.
   The analysis showed that conviviality and openness are complex and

Abstract = {{Data collection by conservation biologists is undergoing radical change,
   with researchers collaborating across disciplines to create bespoke,
   low-cost monitoring equipment from open-source hardware (OSH). Compared
   to commercial hardware, OSH dramatically reduces participation costs.
   Four barriers currently hold back its wide adoption: (1) user
   inexperience inhibits initial uptake; (2) complex and costly
   manufacturing/distribution procedures impede global dissemination; (3)
   lack of creator support results in lapsed projects; and (4) lack of user
   support degrades continued utility in the field. Here, we propose a
   framework to address these barriers, illustrating how OSH offers a route
   to rapid expansion of community-driven conservation action.}},

Abstract = {{The analysis of seismic noise provides a reliable estimation of the soil
   properties, which supposes the starting point for the assessment of the
   seismic hazard. The horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio technique
   calculates the resonant frequency of the soil just by using a single
   three-component sensor. Array measurements require at least several
   vertical sensors registering simultaneously and their analysis provides
   an estimation of the surface waves dispersion curve. Although these
   methods are relatively cheaper than other geotechnical techniques, the
   cost of the sensors and the multi-channel data acquisition system means
   that small research groups cannot afford this kind of equipment. In this
   work, two prototypes for registering seismic noise have been developed
   and implemented: a three-channel acquisition system, optimized for
   working with three-component sensors; and a twelve-channel acquisition
   system, prepared for working simultaneously with twelve vertical
   geophones. Both prototypes are characterized by being open-hardware,
   open-software, easy to implement, and low-cost. The main aim is to
   provide a data acquisition system that can be reproduced and applied by
   any research group. Both developed prototypes have been tested and
   compared with other commercial equipment, showing their suitability to
   register seismic noise and to estimate the soil characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{The use of animal-borne devices in wildlife studies is increasing due to
   the miniaturization of sensors and reductions in component costs.
   Retrieval of animal-borne devices is often advantageous for several
   reasons, including data retrieval and animal welfare considerations;
   however, commercially available drop-off units are often prohibitively
   expensive and/or unreliable. Here, we present `OpenDropOff', an
   open-source, low-cost electronic drop-off unit for remotely detaching
   animal-borne sensors from individuals. OpenDropOff devices function by
   using heat, produced by running an electrical current through resistance
   wire (nichrome), to melt nylon (e.g. fishing) line, detaching sensors
   from animals at or after a pre-determined time. OpenDropOff can be
   constructed using commercially available components (costing < USD \$15
   in total; approximately 10\% or less of many commercially available
   drop-off units) and can be customized to fit project- and
   species-specific needs. Fourteen OpenDropOff devices have been field
   deployed on koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) (n = 11), swamp wallaby
   (Wallabia bicolor) (n = 1), Australian brush turkey (Alectura lathami)
   (n = 1) and Australian white ibis (Threskiornis molucca) (n = 1), with
   the only detachment failure occurring after a device was damaged during
   the koala's unrelated death. OpenDropOff devices provide a wider range
   of researchers with a reliable, cost-effective tool for detaching
   animal-borne sensors. Their use could allow researchers to more
   efficiently allocate project resources, and their flexibility provides
   an opportunity to mitigate animal welfare concerns surrounding the use
   of animal-borne devices.}},

Abstract = {{We report an easily assembled, high performance liquid/liquid separator
   constructed from a drilled-out block of aluminium, a short length of
   porous polytetrafluoroethylene tubing, and a small number of
   off-the-shelf components and 3D-printed parts. The separator relies on
   the two incoming liquids having different wettabilities to the wall of
   the porous capillary, with the more strongly wetting liquid leeching
   through the porous wall while the other liquid passes unhindered through
   the interior channel. To achieve complete separation of the two phases,
   the fluid streams at the separator outlets are monitored optically, and
   the back-pressure at one outlet is iteratively adjusted using a
   motorised needle valve until smooth time-invariant signals are recorded
   at both outlets. The separator may be applied to many pairings of
   immiscible liquids over a broad range of flow rates, automatically
   establishing complete separation within minutes of activation and
   adjusting dynamically to subsequent changes in the flow conditions. The
   separator - whose performance is competitive with far costlier
   commercial systems - is released here as open hardware, with technical
   diagrams, a full parts list, assembly instructions, and source code for
   its firmware.}},

Abstract = {{In all studies involving wind speed, such as meteorology, wind turbines
   and agriculture accurate speed information for decision making is
   required. There are several types of anemometers, with medium and high
   costs, such as cup, hot wire and pitot tubes, the hot wire being more
   sensitive and expensive than others. The device developed in this work
   is the cup anemometer, that is easy to build. The great advantage of
   this device is the low cost, with an approximate value of US\$ 50.00,
   using simple materials that are easy to find in commercial stores. The
   Reed Switch sensor is also another advantage as it does not require a
   sophisticated programming, as well as the open platform Arduino. The use
   of theoretical aerodynamic drag coefficients and the presented
   calculations resulted in values very close to a commercial anemometer.
   The coefficient of determination between the cup Anemometer and the
   standard sensor of Meteorological Research Institute IPMet/Brazil is
   R-2=0.9999, indicating strong correlation between the instruments. As
   the reference anemometer (IPMet) has high embedded technology and the
   prototype is low cost, we conclude that the project has an attractive
   cost benefit for possible development and production, reaching the
   objective of this work.}},

   open-source hardware control platform}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{AUG 21}},
Abstract = {{Azimuthal beam scanning eliminates the uneven excitation field arising
   from laser interference in through-objective total internal reflection
   fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. The same principle can be applied to
   scanning angle interference microscopy (SAIM), where precision control
   of the scanned laser beam presents unique technical challenges for the
   builders of custom azimuthal scanning microscopes. Accurate
   synchronization between the instrument computer, beam scanning system
   and excitation source is required to collect high quality data and
   minimize sample damage in SAIM acquisitions. Drawing inspiration from
   open-source prototyping systems, like the Arduino microcontroller
   boards, we developed a new instrument control platform to be affordable,
   easily programmed, and broadly useful, but with integrated, precision
   analog circuitry and optimized firmware routines tailored to advanced
   microscopy. We show how the integration of waveform generation,
   multiplexed analog outputs, and native hardware triggers into a single
   central hub provides a versatile platform for performing fast
   circle-scanning acquisitions, including azimuthal scanning SAIM and
   multiangle TIRF. We also demonstrate how the low communication latency
   of our hardware platform can reduce image intensity and reconstruction
   artifacts arising from synchronization errors produced by software
   control. Our complete platform, including hardware design, firmware,
   API, and software, is available online for community-based development
   and collaboration.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, an alternative to the traditional methodology related to
   signal processing-like subjects is proposed. These are subjects that
   require a deep mathematical and theoretical basis, but the practical
   goal is not often emphasized, which drives students to lose interest in
   the subject. Thus, a software-defined radio environment is proposed to
   provide a more practical view of the subject. This solution consists of
   an open hardware-software platform able to capture and process a wide
   range of frequencies. HackRF is the hardware component, while GNU Radio
   will provide the graphical support to this device. The tests performed
   with a set of 36 students have revealed that they are more satisfied
   with this framework than just employing a traditional equation-based
   environment as Matlab. Furthermore, their scores in the exams also
   support the suitability of the proposed platform.}},

Abstract = {{The majority of bird and bat species are incapable of carrying tags that
   transmit their position to satellites. Given fundamental power
   requirements for such communication, burdened mass guidelines and
   battery technology, this constraint necessitates the continued use of
   very high frequency (VHF) radio beacons. As such, efforts should be made
   to mitigate their primary deficiencies: detection range, localization
   time and localization accuracy. The integration of a radiotelemetry
   system with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) could significantly improve
   the capacity for data collection from VHF tags. We present a
   UAV-integrated radiotelemetry system that relies on open source hardware
   and software. Localization methods, including signal processing, bearing
   estimation based on principal component analysis, localization
   techniques and test results, are discussed. Using a low-power beacon
   applicable for bats and small birds, testing showed that the improved
   vantage of the UAV-radiotelemetry system (UAV-RT) provided significantly
   higher received signal power compared to the low-level flights (maximum
   range beyond 1.4 km). Flight testing of localization methods showed
   median bearing errors between 2.3 degrees and 6.8 degrees, with
   localization errors of between 5\% and 14\% of the distance to the tag.
   In a direct comparison to an experienced radiotelemetry user, the UAV-RT
   system provided bearing and localization estimates with 53\% less error.
   This paper introduces the core functionality and use methods of the
   UAV-RT system, while presenting baseline localization performance
   metrics. An associated website hosts plans for assembly and software
   installation. The methods of UAV-RT use for tag detection will be
   further developed in future works. For both the detection and
   localization problems, the mobility of a flying asset drastically
   reduces tracker time requirements. A 7-min flight would be sufficient to
   collect five equally spaced bearing estimates over a 1-km transect. The
   use of a software-defined radio on the UAV-RT system will allow for the
   simultaneous detection and localization of multiple tags.}},

Abstract = {{Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are a rapidly evolving tool in
   geosciences and are increasingly deployed for studying the dynamic
   processes of the earth's surface. To assess the potential of autonomous
   low-cost UAVs for the mapping and monitoring of alpine glaciers, we
   conducted multiple aerial surveys on the Kanderfirn in the Swiss Alps in
   2017 and 2018 using open hardware and software of the Paparazzi UAV
   project. The open-source photogrammetry software OpenDroneMap was tested
   for the generation of high-resolution orthophotos and digital surface
   models (DSMs) from aerial imagery and cross-checked with the
   well-established proprietary software Pix4D. Accurately measured ground
   control points served for the determination of the geometric accuracy of
   the orthophotos and DSMs. A horizontal (xy) accuracy of 0.7-1.2 m and a
   vertical (z) accuracy of 0.7-2.1 m was achieved for OpenDroneMap,
   compared to a xy-accuracy of 0.3-0.5 m and a z-accuracy of 0.4-0.5 m
   obtained for Pix4D. Based on the analysis and comparison of different
   orthophotos and DSMs, surface elevation, roughness and brightness
   changes from 3 June to 29 September 2018 were quantified. While the
   brightness of the glacier surface decreased linearly over the ablation
   season, the surface roughness increased. The mean DSM-based elevation
   change across the glacier tongue was 8 m, overestimating the measured
   melting and surface lowering at the installed ablation stakes by about
   1.5 m. The presented results highlight that self-built fixed-wing UAVs
   in tandem with open-source photogrammetry software are an affordable
   alternative to commercial remote-sensing platforms and proprietary
   software. The applied low-cost approach also provides great potential
   for other regions and geoscientific disciplines.}},

Abstract = {{Open-source technology for supporting the Industry 4.0 has become the
   target of academic research in many sectors. This study reviewed the
   trends of open-source technology, its forms, and some industrial
   applications. As a case study using open-source hardware and software
   for the mining industry, this study proposed a low-cost environmental
   monitoring system for non-metallic underground mines to support mine
   safety and occupational health issues. The system was developed using
   open-source hardware, Arduino and 3D printer, to design the monitoring
   device. An open-source software, MIT App Inventor, was used for
   developing an Android application for smartphones to enable remote
   communication with the system. Field experiments were conducted at an
   underground tunnel and a non-metallic underground mining site to assess
   the performance of the system in both mobile and static modes,
   respectively. Although a few limitations related to the precision of the
   low-cost dust and gas sensors still exist, the findings of the
   experiments show that the mining industry can benefit from open-source
   technology deployment when considering cost factors.}},

Abstract = {{In the era of technological advances and innovations in transportation
   technologies, application of driving simulators for the investigation
   and assessment of the driving process provides a safe and suitable
   testing environment. Although driving simulators are crucial for further
   improvements in transportation, it is important to resolve one of their
   main disadvantages-simulator sickness. Therefore, suitable methods for
   the assessment of simulator sickness are required. The main aim of this
   paper was to present a non-invasive method for assessing simulator
   sickness by recording gastric myoelectrical
   activity-electrogastrography. Open-source hardware for
   electrogastrography together with recordings obtained in 13 healthy
   volunteers is presented, and the main aspects of signal processing for
   artifact cancellation and feature extraction were discussed. Based on
   the obtained results, it was concluded that slow-wave electrical gastric
   activity can be recorded during driving simulation by following adequate
   recommendations and that proposed features could be beneficial in
   describing non-ordinary electrogastrography signals.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The Internet of Things (IoT) and its applications are
   growing simultaneously. These applications need new intelligent devices
   along heterogeneous networking. Which makes them costly to implement
   indeed. Platforms and open devices designed for open-source hardware are
   possible solutions. This research was conducted under an IoT design,
   implementation, and assessment model for the remote monitoring of pulse
   oximetry via oxygen partial saturation (SpO(2)) and heart rate (HR) with
   low-energy consumption. Methods: This study focused on the development
   of SpO(2) and HR measurements that will allow the monitoring and
   estimation in real time of the user's state and health related to the
   established parameters. Measurements were acquired and recorded using a
   remote web server that recorded the acquired variables for further
   processing. The statistical analysis data allows comparison of the
   registered data measured with theoretical models. Results: The IoT model
   was developed use Bluetooth low-energy devices, which comply with
   low-cost and open-hardware solutions operated via `HTTP requests' for
   data transmission and reception from a cloud server to an edge device.
   Network performance assessment was conducted to guarantee the
   availability and integrity of the acquired values and signals. The
   system measured SpO(2) and HR variables. The most significant result was
   to achieve energy consumption 20\% lower than that of devices in the
   market. Conclusions: In summary, the acquired data validation based on
   the IoT model had a transmission error of 0.001\% which proves its
   applicability in healthcare.}},

Abstract = {{We present the developmental considerations, design, and deployment of
   an autonomous modular terrestrial rover for ice-sheet exploration that
   is inexpensive, easy to construct, and allows for instrumentation
   customization. The total construction cost for this rover is less than
   USD 3000, approximately one-tenth the cost of existing platforms, and it
   can be built using facilities frequently available at academic
   institutions (machine shop, 3-D printer, open-source hardware and
   software). Instrumentation deployed on this rover can be customized; the
   rover presented in this study was equipped with a dual-frequency GPS
   receiver and a digital SLR camera for constructing digital elevation
   models using structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry. We deployed
   this prototype rover on the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream to map local
   variations in snow accumulation and surface topography. The rover
   conducted four autonomous missions based out of the East Greenland
   Ice-Core Project (EastGRIP) camp during July 2017, measuring surface
   elevation transects across the hazardous ice-stream shear margins.
   During these missions, the rover proved capable of driving over 20 km on
   a single charge with a drawbar pull of 250 N, sufficient to tow
   instrumentation of up to 100 kg. The rover also acquired photographs
   that were subsequently used to construct digital elevation models of a
   site monitored for spatiotemporal variability in snow accumulation,
   demonstrating adequate stability for high-resolution imaging
   applications. Due to its low cost, low-power requirements, and simple
   modular design, mass deployments of this rover design are practicable.
   Operation of the rover in hazardous areas circumvents the substantial
   expense and risk to personnel associated with conventional, crewed
   deployments. Thus, this rover is an investigatory plat-form that enables
   direct exploration of polar environments considered too hazardous for
   conventional field expeditions.}},

Abstract = {{An automated method based on open-source hardware was created for the
   separation of porphyrins fractions from crude oil, an essential step for
   the quantification of V and Ni as metalloporphyrins. Preparative liquid
   chromatography was implemented with a reverse phase gradient from MeOH
   to toluene. The system allows three solvents and fractions changes by
   using quaternary valves connected to an Arduino microcontroller,
   programmed on the basis of the absorbance signal measured and its first
   derivative. Additionally, the method was applied to crude oils
   (Venezuelan National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 8505
   and from a marine reservoir). V and Ni were determined by inductively
   coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and the V-porphyrin profile
   was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-ICP-MS.
   The concentrations of the metals grow in the last eluting toluene
   fractions, associated with asphaltenes. On the other hand, V-porphyrins
   in the first eluting MeOH fractions showed profiles of labile compounds,
   with a higher percentage in the Brazilian crude oil (4.9 mg L-1,
   corresponding to 18\% of total V), in comparison to the one from the
   biodegraded NIST 8505 (59 mg L-1, corresponding to 7\% of total V). The
   overall methodology has a good reproducibility and provides information
   on elements concentrations associated with porphyrin class compounds.}},

Title = {{OPEnS Hub: Real-Time Data Logging, Connecting Field Sensors t o Google

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAY 31}},
Abstract = {{In Earth science, we must often collect data from sensors installed in
   remote locations. Retrieving these data and storing them can be
   challenging. Present options include proprietary commercial dataloggers,
   communication devices, and protocols with rigid software and data
   structures that may require ongoing expenses. While there are
   open-source solutions that include telemetry, such as EnviroDIY's
   Mayfly, none presently generate real-time, remotely accessible workbooks
   (Aufdenkampe et al., 2017; EnviroDIY, 2018). The Openly Published
   Environmental Sensing (OPEnS) Lab developed the OPEnS Hub, a new
   approach to using low-power, open-source hardware and software to
   achieve real-time data logging from the field to the web. The Hub is an
   order of magnitude less expensive than commercial products, inherently
   modular and flexible, and aims to reduce technical barriers for users
   with little programming experience (DeBell, 2019). Data can be collected
   remotely using a host of transmission protocols to relay data from
   distributed in situ monitoring devices. The Hub mesh-networks with
   several nodes and backs up to an onboard microSD card. Telemetry options
   include 900 MHz Long Range Radio (LoRa) with up to 25 km range and
   Nordic Radio Frequency (nRF) for higher data rates (Feather, 2018).
   Ongoing transmissions from the Hub to the internet currently employ
   Ethernet with potential support for Wi-Fi and the cell network. The Hub
   engages a dynamic, low-latency portal to Google Sheets via the free
   Application Programming Interface (API), PushingBox, and an adaptable
   Google Apps Script. This framework was tested on 12 individual sensors
   nodes at remote sites in Oregon. This manuscript details our methods and
   evaluates PushingBox, Google Apps Script, Adafruit Industries'
   open-hardware Feather development boards, the Hypertext Transfer
   Protocol (HTTP), and the aforementioned modes of data transfer.}},

   Real-Time Oriented-Object Detection Method}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{MAY 2}},
Abstract = {{Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Manipulators (UAMs) have shown promising
   potential in mobile 3-dimensional grasping applications, but they still
   suffer from some difficulties impeding their board applications, such as
   target detection and indoor positioning. For the autonomous grasping
   mission, the UAMs need ability to recognize the objects and grasp them.
   Considering the efficiency and precision, we present a novel
   oriented-object detection method called Rotation-SqueezeDet. This method
   can run on embedded-platforms in near real-time. Besides, this method
   can give the oriented bounding box of an object in images to enable a
   rotation-aware grasping. Based on this method, a UAM platform was
   designed and built. We have given the formulation, positioning, control,
   and planning of the whole UAM system. All the mechanical designs are
   fully provided as open-source hardware for reuse by the community.
   Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme was validated in
   multiple experimental trials, highlighting its applicability of
   autonomous aerial rotational grasping in Global Positioning System (GPS)
   denied environments. We believe this system can be deployed to many
   potential workplaces which need UAM to accomplish difficult manipulation
   tasks.}},

Abstract = {{European Robotics League (ERL) Emergency Robots is an outdoor robotics
   contest focusing on multidomain emergency response scenarios. In this
   context, the deployed robots are expected to fulfill land, underwater,
   and flying cooperative tasks which emulate real-world situations
   inspired by the 2011 Fukushima accident. Participation of the Tuscany
   Robotics Team at ERL Emergency Robots 2017 was deeply affected by damage
   to (and resulting unavailability of) the unmanned ground vehicle to be
   used in the competition. This damage occurred 3 days before the
   challenge. An entirely new working mobile platform was built from
   scratch using a low-cost chassis. It was able to compete with the other
   participants in the challenge and achieved various tasks (similar to
   83\% of the tasks completed by the best performer). The paper provides a
   complete description of the work carried out and the system used during
   the competition. The development was based on low-cost solutions, in
   particular: Adoption of open-hardware and open-software technology,
   providing cheap and fast-prototyping solutions. Use of smartphones,
   allowing sophisticated sensors to be exploited in an affordable way.
   Employment of Cloud infrastructures, to reduce the computational burden
   of offloading heavy processes. Results of this experience represent a
   concrete demonstration, showing that even low-cost solutions can achieve
   complex tasks, such as those required for the European robotic
   competition. The presented lessons learned aim to provide guidelines
   useful for reacting to unexpected events. Finally, the team was honored
   with the Creativity Award ``for building a land robot from scratch in
   less than 2 days when their ground platform broke.{''}}},

   with Long Range Sub-GHz Backbone}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{19}},

Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Ultra-wideband (UWB) localization is one of the most promising
   approaches for indoor localization due to its accurate positioning
   capabilities, immunity against multipath fading, and excellent
   resilience against narrowband interference. However, UWB researchers are
   currently limited by the small amount of feasible open source hardware
   that is publicly available. We developed a new open source hardware
   platform, Wi-PoS, for precise UWB localization based on Decawave's
   DW1000 UWB transceiver with several unique features: support of both
   long-range sub-GHz and 2.4 GHz back-end communication between nodes,
   flexible interfacing with external UWB antennas, and an easy
   implementation of the MAC layer with the Time-Annotated Instruction Set
   Computer (TAISC) framework. Both hardware and software are open source
   and all parameters of the UWB ranging can be adjusted, calibrated, and
   analyzed. This paper explains the main specifications of the hardware
   platform, illustrates design decisions, and evaluates the performance of
   the board in terms of range, accuracy, and energy consumption. The
   accuracy of the ranging system was below 10 cm in an indoor lab
   environment at distances up to 5 m, and accuracy smaller than 5 cm was
   obtained at 50 and 75 m in an outdoor environment. A theoretical model
   was derived for predicting the path loss and the influence of the most
   important ground reflection. At the same time, the average energy
   consumption of the hardware was very low with only 81 mA for a tag node
   and 63 mA for the active anchor nodes, permitting the system to run for
   several days on a mobile battery pack and allowing easy and fast
   deployment on sites without an accessible power supply or backbone
   network. The UWB hardware platform demonstrated flexibility, easy
   installation, and low power consumption.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an open source framework called Creamino. It
   consists of an Arduino-based cost-effective quick-setup EEG platform
   built with off-the-shelf components and a set of software modules that
   easily allow users to connect this system to Simulink or BCI-oriented
   tools (such as BCI2000 or OpenViBE) and set up a wide number of
   neuroscientific experiments. Creamino is capable of processing multiple
   EEG channels in real-time and operates under Windows, Linux, and Mac OS
   X in real-time on a standard PC. Its objective is to provide a system
   that can be readily fabricated and used for neurophysiological
   experiments and, at the same time, can serve as the basis for
   development of novel BCI platforms by accessing and modifying its open
   source hardware and software libraries. Schematics, gerber files, bill
   of materials, source code, software modules, demonstration videos, and
   instructions on how to use these modules are available free of charge
   for research and educational purposes online at
   https://github.com/ArcesUnibo/creamino. Application cases show how the
   system can be used for neuroscientific or BCI experiments. Thanks to its
   low production cost and its compatibility with open-source BCI tools,
   the system presented is particularly suitable for use in BCI research
   and educational applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a new approach for Sun tracking systems is presented. Due
   to the current system limitations regarding costs and operational
   problems, a new approach based on low cost, computer vision open
   hardware and deep learning has been developed. The preliminary tests
   carried out successfully in Plataforma solar de Almeria (PSA), reveal
   the great potential and show the new approach as a good alternative to
   traditional systems. The proposed approach can provide key variables for
   the Sun tracking system control like cloud movements prediction, block
   and shadow detection, atmospheric attenuation or measures of
   concentrated solar radiation, which can improve the control strategies
   of the system and therefore the system performance. (C) 2018 Elsevier

Month = {{MAR 5}},
Abstract = {{Fiber photometry is the process of recording bulk neural activity by
   measuring fluorescence changes in activity sensitive indicators such as
   GCaMP through an optical fiber. We present a system of open source
   hardware and software for fiber photometry data acquisition consisting
   of a compact, low cost, data acquisition board built around the
   Micropython microcontroller, and a cross platform graphical user
   interface (GUI) for controlling acquisition and visualising signals. The
   system can acquire two analog and two digital signals, and control two
   external LEDs via built in LED drivers. Time-division multiplexed
   illumination allows independent readout of fluorescence evoked by
   different excitation wavelengths from a single photoreceiver signal.
   Validation experiments indicate this approach offers better signal to
   noise for a given average excitation light intensity than
   sinusoidally-modulated illumination. pyPhotometry is substantially
   cheaper than commercial hardware filling the same role, and we
   anticipate, as an open source and comparatively simple tool, it will be
   easily adaptable and therefore of broad interest to a wide range of
   users.}},

Title = {{Open-Source Hardware Platforms for Smart Converters with Cloud
   Connectivity}},
Journal = {{ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the design and hardware implementation of
   open-source hardware dedicated to smart converter systems development.
   Smart converters are simple or interleaved converters. They are equipped
   with controllers that are able to online impedance match for the maximum
   power transfer. These conversion systems are particularly feasible for
   photovoltaic and all renewable energies systems working in continuous
   changing operating conditions. Smart converters represent promising
   solutions in recent energetic scenarios, in fact their application is
   deepening and widening. In this context, the availability of a hardware
   platform could represent a useful tool. The platform was conceived and
   released as an open hardware instrument for academy and industry to
   benefit from the improvements brought by the researchers' community. The
   usage of a novel, open-source platform would allow many developers to
   design smart converters, focusing on algorithms instead of electronics,
   which could result in a better overall development ecosystem and rapid
   growth in the number of smart converter applications. The platform
   itself is proposed as a benchmark in the development and testing of
   different maximum power point tracking algorithms. The designed system
   is capable of accurate code implementations, allowing the testing of
   different current and voltage-controlled algorithms for different
   renewable energies systems. The circuit features a bi-directional radio
   frequency communication channel that enables real-time reading of
   measurements and parameters, and remote modification of both algorithm
   types and settings. The proposed system was developed and successfully
   tested in laboratory with a solar module simulator and with real
   photovoltaic generators. Experimental results indicate state-of-art
   performances as a converter, while enhanced smart features pave the way
   to system-level management, real-time diagnostics, and on-the-flight
   parameters change. Furthermore, the deployment feasibility allows
   different combinations and arrangements of several energy sources,
   converters (both single and multi-converters), and modulation
   strategies. To our knowledge, this project remains the only open-source
   hardware smart converter platform used for educational, research, and
   industrial purposes so far.}},

Abstract = {{Although waste stabilization ponds (WSPs) are widely used in developing
   countries, monitoring data on their operational performance are scarce.
   Traditional methods for monitoring in-pond conditions, i.e. conducting
   hand held measurements from a small boat or installing fixed sensor
   networks, are not straightforward to realize and create an unhealthy
   working environment for field workers. A promising technology for the
   safe and efficient collection of monitoring data is a compact autonomous
   surface vehicle (ASV), capable of autonomous navigation along a
   predefined trajectory based on geographic coordinates and measurements
   in different places and depths. In this practical paper, the development
   process, technical details and functional testing results of a low-cost
   ASV for WSP monitoring are presented. Commonly available construction
   materials and electronic components were used to ensure affordability
   and reparability. The access to online tutorials and peer-support was
   crucial for assembling the open-source autopilot and data logger. The
   ASV demonstrated satisfactory performance for both the autonomous
   navigation as well as the georeferenced data logging of measurements at
   a real-scale WSP in Paraguay. This study demonstrates how the adoption
   of open-source hardware and software offers the flexibility for the
   wastewater professionals to develop customized DIY solutions for
   specific monitoring applications and working environments.}},

Title = {{Open Sourcing as a Profit-Maximizing Strategy for Downstream Firms}},
Journal = {{STRATEGY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{41-57}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This paper characterizes and explores a corporate strategy in which
   downstream firms collaborate to develop open substitute designs for
   proprietary hardware they would otherwise purchase from upstream
   suppliers. This strategy centrally involves the downstream firms
   distributing design costs over multiple down-stream firms-a strategy
   that is routine to producers selling to multiple down-stream firms but
   which has been in the past typically not practical for coalitions of
   downstream firms. Today, downstream firms find it increasingly feasible
   to codesign products they may all purchase because of two technological
   trends. First, computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing and
   other design technologies are lowering downstream firms' costs to
   develop designs for purchased hardware inputs. Second, better
   communication technologies are lowering the costs of doing such projects
   collaboratively, even among large groups of downstream customer firms.
   Downstream firms collaborating to develop a design for a hardware input
   they can all purchase could in principle choose to protect their design
   as a club good. However, opening up collaboratively created designs to
   free riders can increase the profits of the contributing firms for
   several reasons we explore and model. Important among these is that free
   revealing draws free riders away from purchases of proprietary software
   or hardware to customer-developed free substitutes. This
   ``scale-stealing{''} mechanism reduces the markets of up-stream
   suppliers of competing proprietary inputs. In the case of hardware only,
   free riders also contribute to reducing the average manufacturing costs
   of the open hardware by increasing purchase volumes and so creating
   increased economies of scale. Resulting reduced unit purchase costs
   benefit downstream firms contributing to the free design as well as free
   riders.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents an innovative and low-cost solution for optimizing

   setup is combined with an optional web-platform, which enables fast
   analysis and comparison of the collected data.
   For the demonstration of the instrument in operation, comparison of
   measurements of solar cell with the developed setup and commercial
   products has been conducted. It is shown that the presented prototype
   provides values of accuracy and precision during I-V curve recording,
   comparable with the values measured using a commercial source-meter
   (Keithley 2400). The study also discusses the unique advantages of easy
   transport and data collection by the setup and the drawbacks in the

Title = {{Deploying Acoustic Detection Algorithms on Low-Cost, Open-Source
   Acoustic Sensors for Environmental Monitoring}},

Abstract = {{Conservation researchers require low-cost access to acoustic monitoring
   technology. However, affordable tools are often constrained to
   short-term studies due to high energy consumption and limited storage.
   To enable long-term monitoring, energy and space efficiency must be
   improved on such tools. This paper describes the development and
   deployment of three acoustic detection algorithms that reduce the power
   and storage requirements of acoustic monitoring on affordable,
   open-source hardware. The algorithms aim to detect bat echolocation, to
   search for evidence of an endangered cicada species, and also to collect
   evidence of poaching in a protected nature reserve. The algorithms are
   designed to run on AudioMoth: a low-cost, open-source acoustic
   monitoring device, developed by the authors and widely adopted by the
   conservation community. Each algorithm addresses a detection task of
   increasing complexity, implementing extra analytical steps to account
   for environmental conditions such as wind, analysing samples multiple
   times to prevent missed events, and incorporating a hidden Markov model
   for sample classification in both the time and frequency domain. For
   each algorithm, we report on real-world deployments carried out with
   partner organisations and also benchmark the hidden Markov model against
   a convolutional neural network, a deep-learning technique commonly used
   for acoustics. The deployments demonstrate how acoustic detection
   algorithms extend the use of low-cost, open-source hardware and
   facilitate a new avenue for conservation researchers to perform
   large-scale monitoring.}},

Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{19}},

Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{An important challenge for our society is the transformation of
   traditional power systems to a decentralized model based on renewable
   energy sources. In this new scenario, advanced devices are needed for
   real-time monitoring and control of the energy flow and power quality
   (PQ). Ideally, the data collected by Internet of Thing (IoT) sensors
   should be shared to central cloud systems for online and off-line
   analysis. In this paper openZmeter (oZm) is presented as an advanced
   low-cost and open-source hardware device for high-precision energy and
   power quality measurement in low-voltage power systems. An analog front
   end (AFE) stage is designed and developed for the acquisition,
   conditioning, and processing of power signals. This AFE can be stacked
   on available quadcore embedded ARM boards. The proposed hardware is
   capable of adapting voltage signals up to 800 V AC/DC and currents up to
   thousands of amperes using different probes. The oZm device is described
   as a fully autonomous open-source system for the computation and
   visualization of PQ events and consumed/generated energy, along with
   full details of its hardware implementation. It also has the ability to
   send data to central cloud management systems. Given the small size of
   the hardware design and considering that it allows measurements under a
   wide range of operating conditions, oZm can be used both as bulk
   metering or as metering/submetering device for individual appliances.
   The design is released as open hardware and therefore is presented to
   the community as a powerful tool for general usage.}},

   challenges need to be taken into account in order to prevent information

   review of the main vulnerabilities, security risk, and threats affecting
   both technologies are carried out. Then, open hardware and open source
   tools like: Proxmark3 and Ubertooth as well as BtleJuice and Bleah are
   used as part of the practical analysis. Lastly, risk mitigation and

Abstract = {{Combining fluorescence and transmitted light sources for microscopy is
   an invaluable method in cellular neuroscience to probe the molecular and
   cellular mechanisms of cells. This approach enables the targeted
   recording from fluorescent reporter protein expressing neurons or glial
   cells in brain slices and fluorescence-assisted electrophysiological
   recordings from subcellular structures. However, the existing tools to
   mix multiple light sources in one-photon microscopy are limited. Here,
   we present the development of several microcontroller devices that
   provide temporal and intensity control of light emitting diodes (LEDs)
   for computer controlled microscopy illumination. We interfaced one
   microcontroller with mu Manager for rapid and dynamic overlay of
   transmitted and fluorescent images. Moreover, on the basis of this
   illumination system we implemented an electronic circuit to combine two
   pulsed LED light sources for fast (up to 1 kHz) ratiometric calcium
   (Ca2+) imaging. This microcontroller enabled the calibration of
   intracellular Ca2+ concentration and furthermore the combination of Ca2+
   imaging with optogenetic activation. The devices are based on affordable
   components and open-source hardware and software. Integration into
   existing bright-field microscope systems will take similar to 1 day. The
   microcontroller based LED imaging substantially advances conventional
   illumination methods by limiting light exposure and adding versatility
   and speed.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Small-animal MRI is an important investigative tool for
   basic and preclinical research. High-resolution anatomical and
   functional studies of the brain require artifact-free images that are
   acquired with a highly sensitive radiofrequency (RF) coil.
   New Method: The animal holder plays an important role in mitigating
   image artifacts: motion artifacts are reduced by immobilizing the animal
   and geometric-distortion artifacts are reduced by accurately positioning
   the animal to improve static-field shimming. The RF coil, in turn, must
   provide high sensitivity over the whole brain and not physically
   interfere with the animal holder. To accomplish these tasks, the animal
   holder and RF coil should be designed in tandem. In this manuscript,
   animal holders and RF coils for mice, rats, and marmoset monkeys are
   described. Each animal holder includes components for anesthesia
   delivery and animal immobilization, as well as a compatible receive
   coil.
   Results/Comparison with Existing Method(s): Animal holders were capable
   of accurate and reproducible positioning (for the marmoset, this was in
   the stereotactic plane), consequently reducing geometric distortion in
   echo-planar images. Ear bars were designed in conjunction with
   receive-coil formers, thereby maximizing the sensitive region of coils,
   while concurrently reducing motion to less than a pixel over EPI time
   series. Motion and SNR were quantified to facilitate direct comparison
   to existing animal holders and RF coils. All computer-aided-design (CAD)
   files of animal holders and RF coils are provided to promote
   dissemination.
   Conclusions: The confluence of design between the animal holder and RF
   coil provides a pragmatic solution for routine imaging of small animals.}},

Abstract = {{Wrist-worn devices hold great potential as a platform for mobile health
   (mHealth) applications because they comprise a familiar, convenient form
   factor and can embed sensors in proximity to the human body. Despite
   this potential, however, they are severely limited in battery life,
   storage, bandwidth, computing power, and screen size. In this paper, we
   describe the experience of the research and development team designing,
   implementing and evaluating Amulet - an open-hardware, open-software
   wrist-worn computing device - and its experience using Amulet to deploy
   mHealth apps in the field. In the past five years the team conducted 11
   studies in the lab and in the field, involving 204 participants and
   collecting over 77,780 hours of sensor data. We describe the technical
   issues the team encountered and the lessons they learned, and conclude
   with a set of recommendations. We anticipate the experience described
   herein will be useful for the development of other research-oriented
   computing platforms. It should also be useful for researchers interested
   in developing and deploying mHealth applications, whether with the
   Amulet system or with other wearable platforms.}},

Abstract = {{The posit number system is proposed as a replacement of IEEE
   floating-point numbers. It is a floating-point system that trades
   exponent bits for significand bits, depending on the magnitude of the
   numbers. Thus, it provides more precision for numbers around 1, at the
   expense of lower precision for very large or very small numbers. Several
   works have demonstrated that this trade-off can improve the accuracy of
   applications. However, the variable-length exponent and significand
   encoding impacts the hardware cost of posit arithmetic. The objective of
   the present work is to enable application-level evaluations of the posit
   system that include performance and resource consumption.
   To this purpose, this article introduces an open-source hardware
   implementation of the posit number system, in the form of a C++
   templatized library compatible with Vivado HLS. This library currently
   implements addition, subtraction and multiplication for custom-size
   posits. In addition, the posit standard also mandates the presence of
   the ``quire{''}, a large accumulator able to perform exact sums of
   products. The proposed library includes the first open-source
   parameterized hardware quire.
   This library is shown to improve the state-of-the-art of posit
   implementations in terms of latency and resource consumption. Still,
   standard 32 bits posit adders and multipliers are found to be much
   larger and slower than the corresponding floating-point operators. The
   cost of the posit 32 quire is shown to be comparable to that of a
   Kulisch accumulator for 32 bits floating-point.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work, a modular and low-cost FPGA-based phased array
   system was developed that uses transducers emitting at 40 kHz for the
   acoustic levitation of small objects (<= 4 mm). The system consists of a
   driver board, transducer arrays with various layouts, and software
   developed in MATLAB (R). The software can be used to simulate the
   acoustic field, calculate acoustic traps, and control the driver board
   via a provided USB-SPI interface. The driver board controls up to 100
   channels simultaneously with square-wave signals up to 20 Vpp with
   pi/1024 phase resolution and 10 bit amplitude resolution. Several phased
   arrays can be linked via a provided (IC)-C-2 interface to increase the
   number of available channels. The functionality of the system is
   demonstrated by the levitation of small objects using a flat 40 kHz
   transducer array.}},

Abstract = {{Modern computer systems are becoming faster, more efficient, and
   increasingly interconnected with each generation. Thus, these platforms
   grow more complex, with new features continually introducing the
   possibility of new bugs. Although the semiconductor industry employs a
   combination of different verification techniques to ensure the security
   of System-on-Chip (SoC) designs, a growing number of increasingly
   sophisticated attacks are starting to leverage cross-layer bugs. These
   attacks leverage subtle interactions between hardware and software, as
   recently demonstrated through a series of real-world exploits that
   affected all major hardware vendors.
   In this paper, we take a deep dive into microarchitectural security from
   a hardware designer's perspective by reviewing state-of-the-art
   approaches used to detect hardware vulnerabilities at design time. We
   show that a protection gap currently exists, leaving chip designs
   vulnerable to software-based attacks that can exploit these hardware
   vulnerabilities. Inspired by real-world vulnerabilities and insights
   from our industry collaborator (a leading chip manufacturer), we
   construct the first representative testbed of real-world
   software-exploitable RTL bugs based on RISC-V SoCs. Patching these bugs
   may not always be possible and can potentially result in a product
   recall. Based on our testbed, we conduct two extensive case studies to
   analyze the effectiveness of state-of-the-art security verification
   approaches and identify specific classes of vulnerabilities, which we
   call HardFails, which these approaches fail to detect. Through our work,
   we focus the spotlight on specific limitations of these approaches to
   propel future research in these directions. We envision our RISC-V
   testbed of RTL bugs providing a rich exploratory ground for future
   research in hardware security verification and contributing to the
   open-source hardware landscape.}},

Abstract = {{To be secure, cryptographic algorithms crucially rely on the underlying
   hardware to avoid inadvertent leakage of secrets through timing side
   channels. Unfortunately, such timing channels are ubiquitous in modern
   hardware, due to its labyrinthine fast-paths and optimizations. A
   promising way to avoid timing vulnerabilities is to devise-and

   variability, i.e., executes in constant-time. In this paper, we present
   IODINE: a clock-precise, constant-time approach to eliminating timing
   side channels in hardware. IODINE succeeds in verifying various open

   IODINE also discovered two constant-time violations: one in a
   floating-point unit and another one in an RSA encryption module.}},

Abstract = {{A new finite-time control method based on a sliding mode for a
   multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is developed to improve both
   the transient and steady-state responses, including overshoot and
   steady-state error in the presence of uncertainties and external
   disturbances. First, a virtual control with nonlinear sliding manifolds
   is designed to achieve position-tracking capability, as well as to
   guarantee the fast convergence of the UAV to a desired position.
   Furthermore, an ultimate control is developed for the desired
   attitude-tracking performance. Various uncertainties, including torque
   due to the discordance between the centre of mass and rotation and wind
   disturbances are considered. The Lyapunov stability theorem is then
   applied step-by-step to prove the asymptotically stable and finite-time
   convergence in position and attitude controllers. Second, the proposed
   controller is implemented in an open-source hardware platform for a
   quadrotor UAV. Both numerical and experimental results are compared to
   validate the tracking performance for attitude and position control, as
   well as robustness under disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{Due to their interdisciplinary nature, devices for
   controlled-environment agriculture have the possibility to turn into
   ideal tools not only to conduct research on plant phenology but also to
   create curricula in a wide range of disciplines. Controlled-environment
   devices are increasing their functionalities as well as improving their
   accessibility. Traditionally, building one of these devices from scratch
   implies knowledge in fields such as mechanical engineering, digital
   electronics, programming, and energy management. However, the
   requirements of an effective controlled-environment device for personal
   use brings new constraints and challenges. This paper presents the
   OpenAgT Personal Food Computer (PFC); a low cost desktop size platform,
   which not only targets plant phenology researchers but also hobbyists,
   makers, and teachers from elementary to high-school levels (K-12). The
   PFC is completely open-source and it is intended to become a tool that
   can be used for collective data sharing and plant growth analysis.
   Thanks to its modular design, the PFC can be used in a large spectrum of
   activities.}},

Abstract = {{With the development of technologies such as the Internet of Things and
   Big Data, agriculture is entering the digital age. Modern information
   technology and intelligent equipment are the development direction of
   agriculture. In this paper, a remote-control system for greenhouse
   environment was developed based on Raspberry Pi, MySQL and Android. The
   system consists of a greenhouse control system (subsystem A), an
   environment monitoring system (subsystem B), a MySQL remote database
   (subsystem C), and an Android monitoring software (subsystem D). The
   subsystem A is used to implement automatic fertigation and collect data
   from subsystem B, which will be uploaded to cloud server database
   (subsystem C). The subsystem B is used to monitor the environmental
   parameters in the greenhouse such as air temperature/humidity, soil
   temperature/humidity etc. The subsystem C is used for storage of
   greenhouse environment data and communication between subsystem B and
   subsystem D. The subsystem D is used for data visualization including
   real-time display, storage and analysis of greenhouse environmental
   data, and remote control of fertigation system including the EC/pH
   control of the fertigation solution, irrigation scheduling, and
   fertigation settings. A proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control
   algorithm is used for the fertigation process of the subsystem A. The
   low-power LoRa technology is used for subsystem B to achieve low-power
   long-distance data transmission, which is especially suitable to
   greenhouses. All monitoring settings can be operated remotely by users.

Abstract = {{Nano-size unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), with few centimeters of
   diameter and sub-10 Watts of total power budget, have so far been
   considered incapable of running sophisticated visual-based autonomous
   navigation software without external aid from base-stations, ad-hoc
   local positioning infrastructure, and powerful external computation
   servers. In this work, we present what is, to the best of our knowledge,
   the first 27 g nano-UAV system able to run aboard an end-to-end,
   closed-loop visual pipeline for autonomous navigation based on a
   state-of-the-art deep-learning algorithm, built upon the open-source
   CrazyFlie 2.0 nano-quadrotor. Our visual navigation engine is enabled by
   the combination of an ultra-low power computing device (the GAP8
   system-on-chip) with a novel methodology for the deployment of deep
   convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We enable onboard real-time
   execution of a state-of-the-art deep CNN at up to 18 Hz. Field
   experiments demonstrate that the system's high responsiveness prevents
   collisions with unexpected dynamic obstacles up to a flight speed of 1.5
   m/s. In addition, we also demonstrate the capability of our visual
   navigation engine of fully autonomous indoor navigation on a 113m
   previously unseen path. To share our key findings with the embedded and
   robotics communities and foster further developments in autonomous
   nano-UAVs, we publicly release all our code, datasets, and trained
   networks.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in positional tracking systems for virtual and augmented
   reality have opened up the possibilities for ubiquitous motion capture
   technology in the consumer market. However, for many applications such
   as in performance art, athletics, neuroscience, and medicine, these
   systems remain too bulky, expensive, and limited to tracking a few
   objects at a time. In this work, we present a small wireless device that
   takes advantage of existing HTC Vive lighthouse tracking technology to
   provide affordable, scalable, and highly accurate positional tracking
   capabilities. This open hardware and open software project contains
   several elements, and the latest contributions described in this paper
   include: (1) a characterization of the optical distortions of the
   lighthouses, (2) a new cross-platform WebBLE interface, and (3) a
   real-time in-browser visualization. We also introduce new possibilities
   with an adaptive calibration to estimate transformation matrices of
   lighthouses, and an FPGA approach to improve precision and adaptability.
   Finally, we show how the new developments reduce setup costs and
   increase the accessibility of our tracking technology.}},

Abstract = {{Hearing loss is one of the most common conditions affecting older adults
   worldwide. Frequent complaints from the users of modern hearing aids
   include poor speech intelligibility in noisy environments and high cost,
   among other issues. However, the signal processing and audiological
   research needed to address these problems has long been hampered by
   proprietary development systems, underpowered embedded processors, and
   the difficulty of performing tests in real-world acoustical
   environments. To facilitate existing research in hearing healthcare and
   enable new investigations beyond what is currently possible, we have
   developed a modern, open-source hearing research platform, Open Speech
   Platform (OSP). This paper presents the system design of the complete
   OSP wearable platform, from hardware through firmware and software to
   user applications. The platform provides a complete suite of basic and
   advanced hearing aid features which can be adapted by researchers. It
   serves web apps directly from a hotspot on the wearable hardware,
   enabling users and researchers to control the system in real time. In
   addition, it can simultaneously acquire high-quality
   electroencephalography (EEG) or other electrophysiological signals
   closely synchronized to the audio. All of these features are provided in
   a wearable form factor with enough battery life for hours of operation
   in the field.}},

   method spending as much less founds as it is possible, by keeping user
   friendly interface, data validity, accuracy of measurement and ease of
   use for final user. Data gathering is achieved in almost 1 ms which is

Abstract = {{The paper describes the possibilities of data acquisition and data
   processing from optical sensing systems. There are some data acquisition
   cards and their disadvantages when used for more complex single fiber
   sensor systems in the paper. It is suitable to use some open source
   hardware because commercially available data acquisition cards are more
   complex and universal which means they have several different
   inputs/outputs and large dimensions. STEMLab 125-14 (Red Pitaya) appears
   to be the most suitable solution because offers 2 analog inputs and 2
   analog outputs.Compare to standard data processing systems, this is
   supposed to be an advantage in preprocessing data using programmable
   logic. This can reduce the volume of transmitted data and can also speed
   up processing. Thus, the measurement system will be smaller and cheaper.
   The device contains DA converters, therefore pulses might be generated
   using the same clock which enables synchronization of backscatter
   signal.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, energy consumption and especially energy saving, are topics of
   great importance. Recent news regarding global warming has increased the
   need to save energy. In Finland, one of the major sources of energy
   consumption is housing. Furthermore, the heating of residential
   buildings accounts for up to 68\% of housing energy consumption.
   Therefore, it is not surprising that apartment energy consumption and
   ways to save energy in housing are a popular research topic in Finland.
   In this paper, two different research areas are introduced: First, a
   literature survey is presented on the research subjects of energy saving
   in the area of real estate and housing. The goal is to gain overall
   knowledge of the current state of energy saving research. The overall
   conclusion is that knowledge of energy consumption improves efforts
   toward energy saving. Second, rapid prototyping with off-the-shelf
   devices and open source software are described. These devices are cheap
   to install, and a wide range of sensors are available. Consequently, it
   is important to deal with these topics together. The former studies
   provide knowledge about the usage of open hardware, open software, and
   open architectures with the development of prototype systems for
   gathering data. The literature survey gives us new information on the
   specialties of energy consumption measuring, offering a new area for
   modeling and developing prototype systems. These experiences will be
   taken forward and utilized in energy saving and environmentally
   sustainable solutions, such as Green Computing.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in semiconductor miniaturization are an important driver for
   Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) since their invention in the
   1980s. The increasing number of available on chip logic resources on one
   hand and on the other hand a decrease in part costs let the FPGA market
   grow steadily in recent years. It comes thus at no surprise that more
   and more microprocessors are integrated into programmable logic devices
   as they represent the central functionality in many digital systems. In
   parallel to these technological developments the open-source hardware
   community grew steadily in the last two decades. More than hundred
   open-source CPU cores can thus be found and selecting a core for a
   design project has to be done with care. In this work we thus want to
   focus on open-source 32-bit CPU IP cores suitable for FPGAs and which
   support the upcoming free and open RISC-V instruction set architecture
   that has some interesting advantages when compared to commercial CPU
   cores (as will be outlined in the paper). An overview on available
   projects and activities will be given and evaluation results for a
   selection of cores will be presented.}},

Abstract = {{With the emerging trend of the Internet of Things and Smart City
   environments, new trends have arisen in building applications, too. The
   current approach to application development, known as monolithic
   architecture, is not suitable for the newest appliances. Recently, the
   microservice-based application architecture has emerged as a potential
   solution that could meet the imposed challenges. In order to educate new
   generations of software and IT engineers to be able to develop such
   microservice-based applications, educators at universities should
   establish an efficient platform to ensure this process. This article
   presents the portable and lightweight platform for teaching application
   development based on microservices. The platform is focused on
   supporting lightweight publish/subscribe messaging protocols, such as
   MQTT, and built-on open-source hardware development boards such as
   Arduino/Genuino. This Smart City learning platform is designed to enable
   the collaborative development of systems, applications and services for
   the cities of the future, and it should be efficient enough to support
   the learning of all the necessary skills that can be used for the
   development of complex and large-scale systems. The architecture of the
   proposed platform, as well as its elements are presented in this

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS}},

Pages = {{204-214}},
Abstract = {{Fuzzy rule-based systems (FRBSs) have been successfully applied to a
   wide range of real-world problems. However, they suffer from some design
   issues related to the difficulty to implement them on different hardware
   platforms without additional efforts. To bridge this gap, recently, the
   IEEE Computational Intelligence Society has sponsored the publication of
   the standard IEEE Std 1855-2016 which is aimed at providing the fuzzy
   community with a well-defined approach to model FRBSs in a
   hardware-independent way. In order to provide a runnable version of an
   FRBS that is designed in accordance with the IEEE Std 1855-2016, the
   open source library Java Fuzzy Markup Language (JFML) has been
   developed. However, due to hardware and/or software limitations of
   embedded systems, it is not always possible to run an IEEE Std 1855-2016
   FRBS on this kind of systems. The aim of this paper is to overcome this
   drawback by developing a new JFML module that assists developers in the
   design and implementation of FRBSs for open hardware-embedded systems.
   In detail, the module supports several connection types (WiFi,
   Bluetooth, and USB) in order to make feasible running FRBSs in a remote
   computer when, due to hardware limitations, it is not possible that they
   run locally in the embedded systems. The new JFML module is ready for
   ArduinoTM and Raspberry Pi, but it can be easily extended to other
   hardware architectures. Moreover, the new JFML module allows to
   automatically generate runnable files on Arduino(TM) or Raspberry Pi in
   order to support nonexpert users, that is, users without specific
   knowledge about embedded systems or without strong programming skills.
   The use of the new JFML module is illustrated in two case studies. (c)

   (FPGA)-Based Hardware Co-Processor for Vector Similarity Searching}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{112269-112283}},
Abstract = {{Vector similarity searching consists of comparing a query vector against
   a high volume of entries in a reference data set, according to a chosen
   similarity metric such as the L1-norm, L2-norm, or Hamming distance.
   Large-scale research and commercial applications of these computations
   are developing rapidly across artificial intelligence fields as diverse
   as semantic text querying, retrieval of multimedia materials, and
   prediction of the properties of pharmacological molecules and engineered
   materials. While vector similarity searching is, at present,
   predominantly implemented on standard central processing unit (CPU)
   hardware running optimized indexing algorithms, the interest in
   massively-parallel computing architectures is increasing. Accordingly, a
   range of systems based on graphics processing units (GPU) and
   field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) have been proposed; however, the
   availability of the design materials for these systems remains largely
   confined to a small number of corporations and research institutions.
   Here, we introduce a fully open-source hardware accelerator for vector
   similarity searching, based on an array of 21 FPGAs densely intertwined
   with 42 GB of high-speed dynamic memory and installed on a
   custom-designed compute node board, which yields an aggregate bandwidth
   of 33.6 GB/s and can be seamlessly reconfigured to implement nearly
   arbitrary distance calculations. A novel logic and software

Abstract = {{In power generation systems the synchronization of an alternator with
   the electrical network are an important and critical task. This paper
   presents the design and building of an automatic three-phase alternator
   synchronizer based on a low-cost open-hardware Arduino platform. The
   synchronization is performed by means of measuring a phase voltage of
   both the synchronous generator and the electrical grid; then the
   measured voltages are conditioned and sent to the Arduino board, which
   is programmed to determine the correct moment to connect the alternator
   to the grid. To validate the prototype, a laboratory setup has been
   built with the alternator driven by a commercial dc drive. The design
   and practical implementation of the system is proposed as a
   project-based learning (PBL) activity for undergraduate final year
   students at the University of Bio-Bio, Chile. A description of the
   constructed prototype and the results obtained are presented and

Abstract = {{The use of unmanned aquatic surface vehicles as a tool for exploring and
   inspecting bodies of water, such as lakes and ponds is a research area
   of growing interest. However, using real aquatic vehicles to test and
   develop software and control systems is often not feasible for many
   researchers, due to the limited access to testing pools and the lack of
   availability of low-cost, off-the-shelf surface vehicles. An alternative
   is to utilise software simulations, but these can fail to test important
   system features, such as error characteristics of real sensors, on-board
   processing and the effect of external disturbances on the performance of
   positional control systems. The contribution of the present paper is a
   third method that allows the robot's full software system including real
   world sensors to be tested without the need for pool facilities. This is
   achieved by mapping the physics of an omnidirectional aquatic surface
   robot onto an omnidirectional ground vehicle. A dynamic model of the
   aquatic surface vehicle is deployed within an embedded control system on
   the ground vehicle, meaning that for a given command signal ( applied
   force) the motion of the ground vehicle mimics the motion that would
   occur if it were a surface vehicle floating on a body of water.
   Validation tests demonstrate that the ground vehicle's dynamic behaviour
   matches well with that of a specific aquatic surface vehicle that was
   utilised in this study. However, by changing the dynamic model within
   the embedded control system, the ground vehicle is able to approximate
   the motion of any aquatic surface vehicle. The newly constructed ground
   robot is now an open-source and open-hardware platform.}},

Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2019}},

Pages = {{74586-74601}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes open-source hardware Posit Arithmetic Core Generator
   (PACoGen) for the recently developed universal number posit number
   system, along with a set of pipelined architectures. The posit number
   system composed of a run-time varying exponent component, which is
   defined by a composition of varying length ``regime-bit{''} and
   ``exponent-bit{''} (with a maximum size of ES bits, the exponent size).
   This in effect also makes the fraction part to vary at run-time in size
   and position. These run-time variations inherit an interesting hardware
   design challenge for posit arithmetic architectures. The posit number
   system, being at an infant stage of its development, possess very
   limited hardware solutions for its arithmetic architectures. In this
   view, this paper targets the algorithmic development and generic HDL
   generators (PACoGen) for basic posit arithmetic. The proposed open
   source PACoGen currently includes the adder/subtractor, multiplier, and
   division arithmetic. The PACoGen can provide the Verilog HDL code
   respective posit arithmetic for any given posit word width (N) and
   exponent size (ES), as defined under the posit number system. Further,
   pipelined architectures of 32-bit posit with 6-bit exponent size are
   also proposed and discussed for addition/subtraction, multiplication,
   and division arithmetic. The proposed posit arithmetic architectures are
   demonstrated on the Virtex-7 (xc7vx330t-3ffg1157) FPGA device as well as
   Nangate 15 nm ASIC platform. The PACoGen would open a gateway for
   further posit arithmetic hardware exploration and evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{Cosmic rays represent not only a significant health risk to the crew of
   spacecraft and aircraft but also a fundamental phenomenon of basic
   research on the origin and composition of the universe. High-energy
   atmospheric physics is a newly opened research domain which focuses on
   research of terrestrial gamma-ray flashes that can measurably contribute
   to the aircraft-crew irradiation according to the preliminary computer
   simulations. High-mountain observatories are suitable places for both
   the continual monitoring of cosmic radiation and the detection of
   ionizing radiation generated by lightning. Liulin Mobile Dosimetry Unit
   (MDU) is a silicon diode based radiation dosimeter developed by the team
   of Tsvetan Dachev at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, initially for
   the MIR space station. It is widely used as an instrument for radiation
   monitoring on board aircraft, on high altitude observatories as well as
   for example for ion fragmentation studies. The AIRDOS dosimeter is an
   open source device for measurement in low intensity mixed ionising
   radiation fields. In its aircraft version, it houses silicon PIN diode
   as a radiation detector, an electronics for conversion of the signal to
   the pulse-height spectra, Global Positioning System (GPS) module, memory
   card and batteries for one-month monitoring. The hardware design of
   AIRDOS is built on the Open hardware modular platform MLAB. the firmware
   is written in Open Software platform Processing. Full documentation is
   freely available. Two AIRDOS devices have been installed at Basic
   Enviromental Observtory (BEO) Moussala in December 2017, complementing
   the radiation and environment monitoring instruments already available,
   including the Liulin MDU. Preliminary results of comparative
   measurements of radiation environment at BEO Moussala using the AIRDOS
   units and Liulin MDU will be presented. The results from BEO Moussala
   will be compared with data acquired on hoard aircraft.}},

Title = {{Communication Technologies Based on Voluntary Blinks: Assessment and

Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2019}},

Abstract = {{Some people with severe disabilities are confined in a state in which
   communication is virtually impossible, being reduced to communicating
   with their eyes or using sophisticated systems that translate thoughts
   into words. The EyeTrackers and Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are
   suitable systems for those people but their main drawback is their cost.
   More affordable devices are capable of detecting voluntary blinks and
   translating them into a binary signal that allows the selection, for
   example, of an ideogram on a communication board. We tested four
   different systems based on infrared, bioelectrical signals
   (Electro-Oculography (EOG) and Electro-Encephalography (EEG)), and video
   processing. The experiments were performed by people with/without
   disabilities and analyzed the systems' performances, usability, and
   method of voluntary blinking (long blinks or sequence of two short
   blinks). The best accuracy (99.3\%) was obtained using
   Infrared-Oculography (IR-OG) and the worst with the EEG headset (85.9\%)
   and there was a statistical influence of the technology on accuracy.
   Regarding the method of voluntary blinking, the use of long or double
   blinks had no statistical influence on accuracy, excluding EOG, and the
   time taken to perform double blinks was shorter, resulting in a
   potentially much faster interface. People with disabilities obtained
   similar values but with greater variability. The preferred technology
   and blinking methods were Video-Oculography (VOG) and long blinks,
   respectively. The several Open-Source Hardware (MEW) devices have been
   developed and a new algorithm for detecting voluntary blinks has also
   been proposed, which outperforms most of the published papers in the
   reviewed literature.}},

Abstract = {{The advent of mobile and wearable computing technology has opened up
   tremendous opportunities for health and wellness applications. It is
   increasingly possible for individuals to wear devices that can sense
   their physiology or health-related behaviors, collecting valuable data
   in support of diagnosis, treatment, public health, or other
   applications. From a researcher's point of view, the commercial
   availability of these ``mHealth{''} devices has made it feasible to
   conduct scientific studies of health conditions and to explore
   health-related interventions. It remains difficult, however, to conduct
   systems work or other experimental research involving the hardware,
   software, security, and networking aspects of mobile and wearable
   technology. In this paper we describe the Amulet platform, an
   open-hardware, open-software wrist-worn computing device designed
   specifically for mHealth applications. Our position is that the Amulet
   is an inexpensive platform for research and education, and we encourage
   the mHealth community to explore its potential.}},

Abstract = {{Internet of Things devices have spread to near ubiquity this decade. All
   around us now lies an invisible mesh of communication from devices
   embedded in seemingly everything. Inevitably some of that communication
   flying around our heads will contain data that must be protected or
   otherwise shielded from tampering. The responsibility to protect this
   sensitive information from malicious actors as it travels through the
   air then falls upon the standards used to communicate this data.
   Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is one of these standards, the aim of this
   paper is to put its security standards to test. By attempting to exploit
   its vulnerabilities we can see how secure this standard really is. In
   this paper, we present steps for analyzing the security of BLE devices

Abstract = {{Microplate (i.e. microwell plate) is a flat plate that has a specific
   number of wells to be used as small test tubes in cell-culture studies.
   In most of the low-budget mammalian cell study laboratories, highly
   skilled laboratory personnel should determine microscopic changes in
   microplate well media by taking the microplate outside the incubator and
   by imaging each well medium under a microscope, with the risk of
   contamination and reliability degrading. An alternative solution is to
   use an in-incubator operated live-cell imaging device, which, however,
   cannot be afforded by low-cost laboratories. In this paper, we present
   the design, realization, and test stages of a microplate compatible
   inverted bright-field microscope system that can be used in incubators.
   The developed system enables real-time and long-term in-incubator
   imaging of any user-selectable microplate type. The device can capture
   bright-field microscopic images by using a low-cost CMOS image sensor,
   an inverted varifocal CCTV lens and an array of light emitting diodes.
   In addition, by developed two-axial movement stage and image augmenting
   algorithms, the whole area of a user selectable well (e.g. area of a 6.5
   mm diameter well in a 96-well plate) can be automatically imaged without
   using any other third party software. The long-term performance of the
   system is tested in incubators with human embryonic kidney and breast
   cancer cell lines.}},

Abstract = {{Cars for disabled drivers consist of adapting their functionalities to
   be operated by hands, in a manner a paraplegic individual should rely
   only on their hands. This task can become difficult taking into account
   that the subject must control all functionalities with the same limb. It
   can increase the risk of car accident. To reduce this type of
   distraction, we propose the construction of a prototype to control the
   functionalities in a car using gestures captured by electromyographic
   signals. The data is simulated by an Arduino and, afterwards, sent to a
   Raspberry Pi. Then we perform signal classification using an Extreme
   Learning Machine. The result of the classification will be used to
   control automotive functionalities. Our work demonstrates the
   feasibility of real-time car functionalities control using
   electromyography and efficient low-cost hardware. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Open source paradigm is becoming widely accepted in scientific
   communities and open source hardware is finding its steady place in
   chemistry research. In this review article, we provide the reader with
   the most up-to-date information on open source hardware and software
   resources enabling the construction and utilization of an ``open source
   capillary electrophoresis instrument{''}. While CE is still underused as
   a separation technique, it offers unique flexibility, low-cost, and high
   efficiency and is particularly suitable for open source instrumental
   development. We overview the major parts of CE instruments, such as high
   voltage power supplies, detectors, data acquisition systems, and CE
   software resources with emphasis on availability of the open source
   information on the web and in the scientific literature. This review is
   the first of its kind, revealing accessible blueprints of most parts
   from which a fully functional open source CE system can be built. By
   collecting the extensive information on open source capillary
   electrophoresis in this review article, the authors aim at facilitating
   the dissemination of knowledge on CE within and outside the scientific
   community, fosters innovation and inspire other researchers to improve
   the shared CE blueprints.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines how decisions are made and justified within
   cultures of contribution using an ``operational pragmatics.{''}
   Peer-production and contribution cultures are enfolded in a dynamic of
   resistance and appropriation in relation to capitalism. Open-source and
   contribution-based cultural processes have been critiqued as tending
   towards bureaucracy or becoming enfolded in a never-ending neoliberal
   imaginary from which escape or transcendence become impossible. An
   examination of the values expressed within a peer-production community
   challenges these perspectives and shows how ``operational pragmatics{''}
   can provide moral justifications through reference to matters of
   principle and matters of design. Conflating these matters complicates
   claims about the inherent virtues of participation, especially in
   technical cultures. A qualitative analysis of an open-source hardware
   project shows how competing moral justifications unfold, and how the
   challenges that they pose to capitalism may be tenuous or temporary
   because of the way that justificatory regimes work within technology
   development under capitalism.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural research involves study of the complex
   soil-plant-atmosphere-water system, and data relating to this system
   must be collected under often-harsh outdoor conditions in agricultural
   environments. Rapid advancements in electronic technologies in the last
   few decades, as well as more recent widespread proliferation and
   adoption of electronic sensing and communications, have created many
   options to address the needs of professional, as well as amateur,
   researchers. In this study, an agricultural research project was
   undertaken to collect data and examine the effects of different
   agronomic practices on yield, with the objectives being to develop a
   monitoring system to measure soil moisture and temperature conditions in
   field plots and to upload the data to an internet website. The developed
   system included sensor nodes consisting of sensors and electronic
   circuitry to read and transmit sensor data via radio and a cellular
   gateway to receive node data and forward the data to an internet website
   via cellular infrastructure. Microcontroller programs were written to
   control the nodes and gateway, and an internet website was configured to
   receive and display sensor data. The battery-powered sensor nodes cost
   \$170 each, including electronic circuitry and sensors, and they were
   operated throughout the cropping season with little maintenance on a
   single set of batteries. The solar-powered gateway cost \$163 to
   fabricate, plus an additional cost of \$2 per month for cellular network
   access. Wireless and cellular data transmissions were reliable,
   successfully transferring 95\% of sensor data to the internet website.
   Application of open-source hardware, wireless data transfer, and
   internet-based data access therefore offers many options and advantages
   for agricultural sensing and monitoring efforts.}},

Journal = {{ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The last decade has witnessed a significant reduction in prices and an
   increased performance of electronic components, coupled with the
   influence of the shift towards the generation of open resources, both in
   terms of knowledge (open access), programs (open-source software), and
   components (open hardware). This situation has produced different
   effects in today's society, among which is the empowerment of citizens,
   called makers, who are themselves able to generate citizen science or
   build assembly developments. Situated in the context described above,
   the current study follows a Do-It-Yourself (DIY) approach. In this way,
   it attempts to define a conceptual design of an Internet of Things (IoT)
   node, which is reproducible at both physical and behavioral levels, to
   build IoT nodes which can cover any scenario. To test this conceptual
   design, this study proposes a sensorization node to monitor
   meteorological phenomena. The node is called SEnviro (node) and features
   different improvements such as: the possibility of remote updates using
   Over-the-Air (OTA) updates; autonomy, using 3G connectivity, a solar
   panel, and applied energy strategies to prolong its life; and
   replicability, because it is made up of open hardware and other elements
   such as 3D-printed pieces. The node is validated in the field of smart
   agriculture, with the aim of monitoring different meteorological
   phenomena, which will be used as input to disease detection models to
   detect possible diseases within vineyards.}},

Abstract = {{In general, warehouses are used to store goods or products. In the
   Warehouses, if the user wants to locate any product it is very
   difficult, because user have to do a detailed search manually in all the
   available stockrooms this requires a lot of effort. So to avoid this
   problem the warehouse inventory management system is very helpful
   because it maintains the detailed product information and tells us in
   which stockroom the product is present. The warehouse inventory
   management system is playing a significant aspect in many productions
   and goods based methodology. Though there are many wireless
   communication technologies the RFID suits the best for the warehouse
   inventory management system. The tag information is transferred from the
   transmitter section to open source hardware via a wireless link with the
   aid of internet. The warehouse inventory management system built on the
   architecture of the Internet of Things is developed to track the
   products attached to the tags with product information and their
   respective time stamps for further verification. The Raspberry Pi acts
   as a central server, monitoring all the information. The total system
   gives an archetype to correspond the information flow and material flow.
   The web page which is built in accordance to provide convenient and an
   interface to the user to track the products. The developed system
   results a very low cost system and works dynamically compared with the
   existing present warehouse inventory management systems. (C) 2018

Abstract = {{Simple 3-D printable open source hardware designs have proven to be
   effective scientific instruments at low costs. Further development in
   this area is coupling open source electronics with 3-D printable
   mechanical components to make fully functional
   distributedly-manufactured mechatronic tools for science. One research
   area where such low-cost technology is needed is to characterize thin
   film anti-reflective coatings and transparent conducting oxides (TCOs)
   for the glass, mirror and solar photovoltaic industry whose transmission
   properties are angle dependent. To meet this research need a low-cost
   3-D printable open source dual axis gimbal system is presented in this
   study. An Arduino based microcontroller is used to move the sample
   holder to the user specified angle where two stepper motors control the
   motion providing two degrees of freedom. The sample holder is made in
   such a way that samples can easily be mounted on it by two movable
   latches. The system was validated and characterized for: i)
   unidirectional accuracy, ii) repeatability, iii) backlash, iv) speed
   resolution and v) microstep size. Finally, the mechatronic system is
   tested for the intended application using a halogen light source and a
   spectrometer to measure transmission through glass TCO samples through a
   hemisphere. The system performed as expected has a unidirectional
   accuracy of 2.827 degrees, repeatability of 1.585 degrees, backlash
   error of 1.237 degrees, maximum speed of 35.156 degrees and a verifiable
   microstep size of 0.33 degrees. Despite the highest mean squared errors,
   the open source gimbal system performed adequately while measuring
   transmission of radiation through glass with TCO coatings. This open
   source system also represents a 96\% cost in savings as compared to the
   least expensive commercial variant. The high mean squared errors are
   offset by the cost of the system coupled with its open source nature
   that promotes further collaboration and hence, development.}},

Abstract = {{This work describes the development of a peristaltic pump and a
   photometric detector, using ``Arduino{''} and alternative and low-cost
   materials for flow analysis system. The analytical calibration curve of
   the acid-red-283 using the proposed system presents 0.9984 and 3.9\% as
   the coefficients of determination and variation, and 1.1 and 3.8 mg L-1
   as limits of detection and quantification, respectively. Three prepared
   samples of the acid-red-283 (25, 30 and 35 mg L-1) showed recovery
   between 99 to 104\%. For construction of the peristaltic pump and the
   photometer using Light Emitting Diodes (LED), light-dependent resistor
   (LDR) were spent less than 10\% of the cost was spent on a commercial
   system employing a peristaltic pump and a spectrophotometer.
   Furthermore, the peristaltic pump and the photometer developed in this
   work allow the implementation of practical disciplines, such as
   molecular absorption spectrophotometry and flow analysis system in
   undergraduate courses, making these instruments more accessible,
   especially for the chemistry students.}},

Title = {{How participative is open source hardware ? Insights from online
   repository mining}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV 21}},
Abstract = {{Open Source Hardware (OSH) is an increasingly viable approach to
   intellectual property management extending the principles of Open Source
   Software (OSS) to the domain of physical products. These principles
   support the development of products in transparent processes allowing
   the participation of any interested person. While increasing numbers of
   products have been released as OSH, little is known on the prevalence of
   participative development practices in this emerging field. It remains
   unclear to which extent the transparent and participatory processes
   known from software reached hardware product development. To fill this
   gap, this paper applies repository mining techniques to investigate the
   transparency and workload distribution of 105 OSH product development
   projects. The results highlight a certain heterogeneity of practices
   filling a continuum between public and private development settings.
   They reveal different organizational patterns with different levels of
   centralization and distribution. Nonetheless, they clearly indicate the
   expansion of the open source development model from software into the
   realms of physical products and provide the first large-scale empirical
   evidence of this recent evolution. Therewith, this article gives body to
   an emerging phenomenon and contributes to give it a place in the
   scientific debate. It delivers categories to delineate practices,
   techniques to investigate them in further detail as well as a large
   dataset of exemplary OSH projects. The discussion of first results
   signposts avenues for a stream of research aiming at understanding
   stakeholder interactions at work in new product innovation practices in
   order to enable institutions and industry in providing appropriate
   responses.}},

Abstract = {{Current high-performance-thin-layer-chromatography instrumentation is
   offline and stepwise automated. However, moderate miniaturization offers
   many advantages and together with the transfer of modern print and media
   technologies to the field of chromatography (office chromatography) it
   opens up new avenues. This is demonstrated in an allin-one open-source
   system developed for planar chromatography and especially for
   ultrathin-layer chromatography. Using an InkShield board to control a
   thermal inkjet cartridge, picoliter drops were printed at a resolution
   of 96 dpi on the adsorbent layer. Using Marlin, a popular firmware in 3D
   printing, Cartesian movement of the print head was made possible for
   full control of the printing process. Open-source software was developed
   to control the device in each operation step. Sample solutions and
   mobile phase were inkjet-printed, exemplarily shown for the analysis of
   dye- or paraben-mixture solutions. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were
   investigated for documentation. For example, deep UV LEDs gave access to
   254 nm light, and RGB LEDs gave access to the visible-light range.
   Calibration functions with correlation coefficients superior to 0.999
   were obtained by videodensitometry. The developed modular open-source
   hardware was compact (26 X 31 X 26 cm(3)), light (<3 kg), and affordable
   ((sic)810). For the given analyses, the footprint of current
   instrumentation needed was miniaturized by a factor of 9. The highly
   reduced material design complies with green chemistry and lean
   laboratory. The design and instruction to reproduce the all-in-one
   open-source system were made freely available at
   https://github.com/OfficeChromatography. It is intended to boost
   progress and understanding by the nature of do it yourself.}},

Abstract = {{Possibilities and ways of design, implementation and application of
   microcomputer based embedded SCADA and RFID systems implemented on LINUX

   possibilities and advantages of implementation and application of such
   systems are described. One such practically designed and implemented
   system that performs data acquisition and appropriate control is
   presented and described. Technologies used to realize the system, as
   well as embedded application of such solution are described. The system
   hardware was implemented using open source microcomputer boards, RFID
   and other sensors, WiFi router and additional electronics. The system
   software was implemented using open source tools and programs and LINUX
   operating system. The system was realized using modular approach. It
   enables easy system expandability, simplifying maintenance and adapting
   of the system to user requirements and needs. Access to system
   monitoring and control is possible using web based user interface and
   command line interface. It is achieved balance between functionality and
   cost of the system. Main advantages of the system compared with standard
   SCADA and RFID systems are low cost of the system, optimization
   according to user requirements and needs and low consumption of
   electrical energy. It is specialized and optimized system for specific

Abstract = {{Impedance cardiography (ICG) is a noninvasive method for monitoring
   cardiac dynamics using electrical bioimpedance (EBI) measurements. Since
   its appearance more than 40 years ago, ICG has been used for assessing
   hemodynamic parameters. This paper presents a measurement system based
   on two System on Chip (SoC) solutions and Raspberry PI, implementing
   both a full three-lead ECG recorder and an impedance cardiographer, for
   educational and research development purposes. Raspberry PI is a
   platform supporting Do-I t-Yourself project and education applications
   across the world. The development is part of Biosignal PI, an open
   hardware platform focusing in quick prototyping of physiological
   measurement instrumentation. The SoC used for sensing cardiac
   biopotential is the ADAS1000, and for the EBI measurement is the AD5933.
   The recordings were wirelessly transmitted through Bluetooth to a PC,
   where the waveforms were displayed, and hemodynamic parameters such as
   heart rate, stroke volume, ejection time and cardiac output were
   extracted from the ICG and ECG recordings. These results show how
   Raspberry PI can be used for quick prototyping using relatively widely
   available and affordable components, for supporting developers in
   research and engineering education. The design and development documents
   will be available on www.BiosignalPl.com, for open access under a Non
   Commercial-Share A like 4.0 International License.}},

Abstract = {{Road traffic and its impacts affect various aspects of wellbeing with
   safety, congestion and pollution being of significant concern in cities.
   Although there have been a large number of works done in the field of
   traffic data collection, there are several barriers which restrict the
   collection of traffic data at higher resolution in the cities.
   Installation and maintenance costs can act as a disincentive to use
   existing methods (e.g., loop detectors, video analysis) at a large scale
   and hence limit their deployment to only a few roads of the city. This
   paper presents an approach for vehicle counting using a low cost, simple
   and easily installable system. In the proposed system, vehicles (i.e.,
   bicycles, cars, trucks) are counted by means of variations in the WiFi
   signals. Experiments with the developed hardware in two different
   scenarios-low traffic (i.e., 400 objects) and heavy traffic roads (i.e.,
   1000 objects)-demonstrate its ability to detect cars and trucks. The
   system can be used to provide estimates of vehicle numbers for streets
   not covered by official traffic monitoring techniques in future smart
   cities.}},

Abstract = {{Despite a growing consensus that 3D printing technology has emerged as a
   revolutionary driver of innovation in society and has grown
   exponentially as an innovation ecosystem, our understanding of how the
   3D printing ecosystem emerged and has grown is still limited. Based on
   the case study and the grounded theory approach, we found that four
   relevant platforms--open-source hardware platforms, online service
   platforms, free and low-cost 3D design software platforms, and
   crowdsourcing platforms-nurtured the innovation ecosystem. We also found
   that complementary relationships among the four platforms accelerated
   the growth of the ecosystem from the perspective of an increase in the
   user base, 3D printer sales, 3D design contents, and the emergence of
   entrepreneurial firms that are developing the platforms. Consequently,
   we newly suggest ``complementary multiplatforms,{''} a platform strategy
   that develops multiple platforms with complementary relationships for
   nurturing an innovation ecosystem. Our findings provide important
   theoretical grounds for the multiplatform strategy with complementary
   relationships aimed at facilitating the growth of an innovation
   ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To study the role of temperature in biological systems,
   diagnostic contrasts and thermal therapies, RF pulses for MR spin
   excitation can be deliberately used to apply a thermal stimulus. This
   application requires dedicated transmit/receive (Tx/Rx) switches that
   support high peak powers for MRI and high average powers for RF heating.
   To meet this goal, we propose a high-performance Tx/Rx switch based on
   positive-intrinsic-negative diodes and quarter-wavelength (lambda/4)
   stubs.
   Methods: The lambda/4 stubs in the proposed Tx/Rx switch design route
   the transmitted RF signal directly to the RF coil/antenna without
   passing through any electronic components (e.g.,
   positive-intrinsic-negative diodes). Bench measurements, MRI, MR
   thermometry, and RF heating experiments were performed at f = 297 MHz
   (B-0 = 7 T) to examine the characteristics and applicability of the
   switch.
   Results: The proposed design provided an isolation of -235.7dB/-241.5dB
   during transmission/reception. The insertion loss was -20.41dB/-20.27dB
   during transmission/reception. The switch supports high peak (3.9 kW)
   and high average (120 W) RF powers for MRI and RF heating at f = 297
   MHz. High-resolution MRI of the wrist yielded image quality competitive
   with that obtained with a conventional Tx/Rx switch. Radiofrequency
   heating in phantom monitored by MR thermometry demonstrated the switch
   applicability for thermal modulation. Upon these findings, thermally
   activated release of a model drug attached to thermoresponsive polymers
   was demonstrated.
   Conclusion: The high-power Tx/Rx switch enables thermal MR applications
   at 7 T, contributing to the study of the role of temperature in
   biological systems and diseases. All design files of the switch will be
   made available open source at www.opensourceimaging.org.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory automation improves test reproducibility, which is vital to
   patient care in clinical laboratories. Many small and specialty
   laboratories are excluded from the benefits of automation due to low
   sample number, cost, space, and/or lack of automation expertise. The
   Minimum Viable Option (MVO) automation platform was developed to address
   these hurdles and fulfill an unmet need. Consumer 3D printing enabled
   rapid iterative prototyping to allow for a variety of instrumentation
   and assay setups and procedures. Three MVO versions have been produced.
   MVOv1.1 successfully performed part of a clinical assay, and results
   were comparable to those of commercial automation. Raspberry Pi 3 Model
   B (RPI3) single-board computers with Sense Hardware Attached on Top
   (HAT) and Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2 hardware were remotely accessed
   and evaluated for their suitability to qualify the latest MVOv1.2
   platform. Sense HAT temperature, barometric pressure, and relative
   humidity sensors were stable in climate-controlled environments and are
   useful in identifying appropriate laboratory spaces for automation
   placement. The RPI3 with camera plus digital dial indicator logged axis
   travel experiments. RPI3 with camera and Sense HAT as a light source
   showed promise when used for photometric dispensing tests. Individual
   well standard curves were necessary for well-to-well light and path
   length compensations.}},

Abstract = {{Critical to maintaining quality control in high-throughput screening is
   the need for constant monitoring of liquid-dispensing fidelity.
   Traditional methods involve operator intervention with gravimetric
   analysis to monitor the gross accuracy of full plate dispenses, visual
   verification of contents, or dedicated weigh stations on screening
   platforms that introduce potential bottlenecks and increase the
   plate-processing cycle time. We present a unique solution using
   open-source hardware, software, and 3D printing to automate dispenser
   accuracy determination by providing real-time dispense weight
   measurements via a network-connected precision balance. This system uses
   an Arduino microcontroller to connect a precision balance to a local
   network. By integrating the precision balance as an Internet of Things
   (IoT) device, it gains the ability to provide real-time gravimetric
   summaries of dispensing, generate timely alerts when problems are
   detected, and capture historical dispensing data for future analysis.
   All collected data can then be accessed via a web interface for
   reviewing alerts and dispensing information in real time or remotely for
   timely intervention of dispense errors. The development of this system
   also leveraged 3D printing to rapidly prototype sensor brackets,
   mounting solutions, and component enclosures.}},

Abstract = {{The emerging discussion about the sustainability potential of
   distributed production is the starting point for this paper. The focus
   is on the ``design global, manufacture local{''} model. This model
   builds on the conjunction of the digital commons of knowledge and design
   with desktop and benchtop manufacturing technologies (from
   three-dimensional printers and laser cutters to low-tech tools and
   crafts). Two case studies are presented to illustrate three interlocked
   practices of this model for degrowth. It is argued that a ``design
   global, manufacture local{''} model, as exemplified by these case
   studies, seems to arise in a significantly different political economy
   from that of the conventional industrial model of mass production.
   ``Design global, manufacture local{''} may be seen as a platform to
   bridge digital and knowledge commons with existing physical
   infrastructures and degrowth communities, in order to achieve
   distributed modes of collaborative production. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The current disruptive innovation in civilian drone (UAV) applications
   has led to an increased need for research and development in UAV
   technology. The key challenges currently being addressed are related to
   UAV platform properties such as functionality, reliability, fault
   tolerance, and endurance, which are all tightly linked to the UAV flight
   controller hardware and software. The lack of standardization of flight
   controller architectures and the use of proprietary closed-source flight
   controllers on many UAV platforms, however, complicates this work:
   solutions developed for one flight controller may be difficult to port
   to another without substantial extra development and testing. Using
   open-source flight controllers mitigates some of these challenges and
   enables other researchers to validate and build upon existing research.
   This paper presents a survey of the publicly available open-source drone
   platform elements that can be used for research and development. The
   survey covers open-source hardware, software, and simulation drone
   platforms and compares their main features.}},

Abstract = {{We present the Kilogrid, an open-source virtualization environment and
   data logging manager for the Kilobot robot, Kilobot for short. The
   Kilogrid has been designed to extend the sensory-motor abilities of the
   Kilobot, to simplify the task of collecting data during experiments, and
   to provide researchers with a tool to fine-control the experimental
   setup and its parameters. Based on the design of the Kilobot and
   compatible with existing hardware, the Kilogrid is a modular system
   composed of a grid of computing nodes, or modules that provides a
   bidirectional communication channel between the Kilobots and a remote
   workstation. In this paper, we describe the hardware and software
   architecture of the Kilogrid system as well as its functioning to
   accompany its release as a new open hardware tool for the swarm robotics
   community. We demonstrate the capabilities of the Kilogrid using a
   200-module Kilogrid, swarms of up to 100 Kilobots, and four different
   case studies: exploration and obstacle avoidance, site selection based
   on multiple gradients, plant watering, and pheromone-based foraging.
   Through this set of case studies, we show how the Kilogrid allows the
   experimenter to virtualize sensors and actuators not available to the
   Kilobot and to automatize the collection of data essential for the
   analysis of the experiments.}},

   Microcontrollers}},
Journal = {{MICROMACHINES}},
Year = {{2018}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Microcontrollers are programmable, integrated circuit chips. In the last
   two decades, their applications to industrial instruments, vehicles, and
   household appliances have reached the extent that microcontrollers are
   now the number-one selling electronic chip of all kinds. Simultaneously,
   the field of lab-on-a-chip research and technology has seen major
   technological leaps towards sample handling, sample preparation, and
   sensing for use in molecular diagnostic devices. Yet, the transformation
   from a laboratory based lab-on-a-chip technology to actual point-of-care
   device products has largely been limited to a fraction of the foreseen
   potential. We believe that increased knowledge of the vast possibilities
   that becomes available with open source microcontrollers, especially
   when embedded in easy-to-use development environments, such as the
   Arduino or Raspberry Pi, could potentially solve and even bridge the gap
   between lab-on-a-chip technology and real-life point of care
   applications. The profuse availability and extraordinary capabilities of
   microcontrollers, namely within computation, communication, and
   networking, combined with easy-to-use development environments, as well
   as a very active and fast moving community of makers, who are eager to
   share their knowledge, could potentially be the difference between a
   dreadful chip-in-a-lab-situation, and the next successful start-up. Here
   follows a brief insight into how open source microcontrollers could
   potentially have a transformative effect on the field of lab-on-a-chip
   research and technology. Details in some specific areas of application
   are briefly treated before addressing challenges and future
   perspectives.}},

   different positions of the tube in order to take measurements at
   different residence times without having to disassemble the photometer
   or the flow reactor system. The bespoke photometer was used to determine
   the residence time distribution (RTD) of various
   microreactors/micromixers, as well as for measuring the reaction rate
   constant for the base-induced hydrolysis of p-nitrophenol acetate in a
   biphasic segmented flow system. Owing to the 1 ms sample acquisition

Abstract = {{Background. A trainer for online laparoscopic surgical skills assessment
   based on the performance of experts and nonexperts is presented. The
   system uses computer vision, augmented reality, and artificial
   intelligence algorithms, implemented into a Raspberry Pi board with
   Python programming language. Methods. Two training tasks were evaluated
   by the laparoscopic system: transferring and pattern cutting. Computer
   vision libraries were used to obtain the number of transferred points
   and simulated pattern cutting trace by means of tracking of the
   laparoscopic instrument. An artificial neural network (ANN) was trained
   to learn from experts and nonexperts' behavior for pattern cutting task,
   whereas the assessment of transferring task was performed using a
   preestablished threshold. Four expert surgeons in laparoscopic surgery,
   from hospital Raymundo Abarca Alarcon, constituted the experienced class
   for the ANN. Sixteen trainees (10 medical students and 6 residents)
   without laparoscopic surgical skills and limited experience in minimal
   invasive techniques from School of Medicine at Universidad Autonoma de
   Guerrero constituted the nonexperienced class. Data from participants
   performing 5 daily repetitions for each task during 5 days were used to
   build the ANN. Results. The participants tend to improve their learning
   curve and dexterity with this laparoscopic training system. The
   classifier shows mean accuracy and receiver operating characteristic
   curve of 90.98\% and 0.93, respectively. Moreover, the ANN was able to
   evaluate the psychomotor skills of users into 2 classes: experienced or
   nonexperienced. Conclusion. We constructed and evaluated an affordable
   laparoscopic trainer system using computer vision, augmented reality,
   and an artificial intelligence algorithm. The proposed trainer has the
   potential to increase the self-confidence of trainees and to be applied
   to programs with limited resources.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the use of an instrumented bicycle and its
   computational model for teaching multibody dynamics. The presented
   approach employs the Whipple model for the kinematic and inverse dynamic

   phase, students ride the instrumented bicycle to collect the necessary
   sensor data. The kinematic and inverse dynamic simulations based on
   these signals provide a full picture of the motion of the system in
   different positions and at a range of velocities and accelerations. In
   addition, they estimate the traction, control, and tire-to-road contact
   forces during the ride. To validate the simulated results, the simulated
   velocity and accelerations are compared with the data acquired with an
   inertial measurement unit (IMU) installed on the bicycle. The paper
   describes the experimental setup of the instrumented bicycle, enabling
   readers to build the very same system for their own educational use. The
   instrumented bicycle system is based on open-source software and as much
   as possible on open hardware.}},

Title = {{PSoC-Stat: A single chip open source potentiostat based on a
   Programmable System on a Chip}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 25}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we demonstrate a potentiostat built with a single
   commercially available integrated circuit (IC) that does not require any
   external electronic components to perform electrochemical experiments.
   This is done using the capabilities of the Programmable System on a Chip
   (PSoC (R)) by Cypress Semiconductor, which integrates all of the
   necessary electrical components. This is in contrast to other recent
   papers that have developed potentiostats but require technical skills or
   specialized equipment to produce. This eliminates the process of having
   to make a printed circuit board and soldering on electronic components.
   To control the device, a graphical user interface (GUI) was developed in
   the python programming language. Python is open source, with a style
   that makes it easy to read and write programs, making it an ideal choice
   for open source projects. As the developed device is open source and
   based on a PSoC, modification to implement other electrochemical
   techniques is straightforward and only requires modest programming
   skills, but no expensive equipment or difficult techniques. The
   potentiostat developed here adds to the growing amount of open source
   laboratory equipment. To demonstrate the PSoC potentiostat in a wide
   range of applications, we performed cyclic voltammetry (to measure
   vitamin C concentration in orange juice), amperometry (to measure
   glucose with a glucose strip), and stripping voltammetry experiments (to
   measure lead in water). The device was able to perform all experiments
   and could accurately measure Vitamin C, glucose, and lead.}},

   performing high speed optical detection of laser-induced photoacoustic
   signals in a concentrated dye solution. Using software modifications
   only, conventional single carrier and also multicarrier heterodyne
   techniques with space and frequency diversity are performed. The latter

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Many Internet of Things (IoT) applications are emerging and evolving
   rapidly thanks to widespread open-source hardware platforms. Most of the
   high-end open-source IoT platforms include built-in peripherals, such as
   the universal asynchronous receiver and transmitter (UART), pulse width
   modulation (PWM), general purpose input output (GPIO) ports and timers,
   and have enough computation power to run embedded operating systems such
   as Linux. However, each IoT platform has its own way of configuring
   peripherals, and it is difficult for programmers or users to configure
   the same peripheral on a different platform. Although diverse
   open-source IoT platforms are widespread, the difficulty in programming
   those platforms hinders the growth of IoT applications. Therefore, we
   propose an easy and convenient way to program and configure the
   operation of each peripheral using a user-friendly Web-based software
   framework. Through the implementation of the software framework and the
   real mobile robot application development along with it, we show the
   feasibility of the proposed software framework, named SoEasy.}},

Title = {{Shaping Streamflow Using a Real-Time Stormwater Control Network}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{``Smart{''} water systems are transforming the field of stormwater
   management by enabling real-time monitoring and control of previously
   static infrastructure. While the localized benefits of active control
   are well-established, the potential for system-scale control of
   watersheds is poorly understood. This study shows how a real-world smart
   stormwater system can be leveraged to shape streamflow within an urban
   watershed. Specifically, we coordinate releases from two
   internet-controlled stormwater basins to achieve desired control
   objectives downstream such as maintaining the flow at a set-point, and
   generating interleaved waves. In the first part of the study, we
   describe the construction of the control network using a low-cost,
   open-source hardware stack and a cloud-based controller scheduling
   application. Next, we characterize the system's control capabilities by
   determining the travel times, decay times, and magnitudes of various
   waves released from the upstream retention basins. With this
   characterization in hand, we use the system to generate two desired
   responses at a critical downstream junction. First, we generate a
   set-point hydrograph, in which flow is maintained at an approximately
   constant rate. Next, we generate a series of overlapping and interleaved
   waves using timed releases from both retention basins. We discuss how
   these control strategies can be used to stabilize flows, thereby
   mitigating streambed erosion and reducing contaminant loads into
   downstream waterbodies.}},

   Off-The-Shelf Technologies}},
Journal = {{ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{As a result of the globalisation of the semiconductor design and
   fabrication processes, integrated circuits are becoming increasingly
   vulnerable to malicious attacks. The most concerning threats are
   hardware trojans. A hardware trojan is a malicious inclusion or
   alteration to the existing design of an integrated circuit, with the
   possible effects ranging from leakage of sensitive information to the
   complete destruction of the integrated circuit itself. While the
   majority of existing detection schemes focus on test-time, they all
   require expensive methodologies to detect hardware trojans.
   Off-the-shelf approaches have often been overlooked due to limited
   hardware resources and detection accuracy. With the advances in
   technologies and the democratisation of open-source hardware, however,
   these tools enable the detection of hardware trojans at reduced costs
   during or after production. In this manuscript, a hardware trojan is
   created and emulated on a consumer FPGA board. The experiments to detect
   the trojan in a dormant and active state are made using off-the-shelf
   technologies taking advantage of different techniques such as Power
   Analysis Reports, Side Channel Analysis and Thermal Measurements.
   Furthermore, multiple attempts to detect the trojan are demonstrated and
   benchmarked. Our simulations result in a state-of-the-art methodology to
   accurately detect the trojan in both dormant and active states using
   off-the-shelf hardware.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial vision algorithms are approaching human performance in many
   respects. However, their computational demands are also growing, which
   constraints their use in mobile and time-sensitive robots. Biological
   vision presents a well known practical solution. Specifically, primates
   limit the computational demands of vision by processing only small parts
   of the scene in detail, and frequently reorienting the eyes to different
   locations. Artificial vision is much more power-intensive than
   biological vision, so this strategy is likely to be increasingly
   relevant to robots, as they become more visually sophisticated. To
   facilitate progress and reduce duplication of work in this area, we have
   developed a 7-degree-of-freedom robotic head that supports such rapid
   saccade-like camera movements, and we are releasing the design files
   under an open-hardware license. The system supports C-mount cameras,
   large foveated lenses, and liquid lenses that allow rapid changes in
   focus distance. It also has a stereo baseline that is roughly the same
   as that of humans, to support stereo processing of nearby objects in
   grasping and manipulation tasks. The main contributions of this work are
   the mechanical design, and the demonstration that its stereo baseline,
   range of motion, and saccade velocity are similar to those of primate
   systems. The main general advantages over existing robotic heads are
   speed and the open-hardware license. The system would also be an ideal
   platform for future research that aims to replicate the performance of
   primate vision systems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores three cases of Do-It-Yourself, open-source
   technologies developed within the diverse array of topics and themes in
   the communities around the Public Laboratory for Open Technology and
   Science (Public Lab). These cases focus on aerial mapping, water quality
   monitoring and civic science practices. The techniques discussed have in
   common the use of accessible, community-built technologies for acquiring
   data. They are also concerned with embedding collaborative and open
   source principles into the objects, tools, social formations and data
   sharing practices that emerge from these inquiries. The focus is on
   developing processes of collaborative design and experimentation through
   material engagement with technology and issues of concern.
   Problem-solving, here, is a tactic, while the strategy is an ongoing
   engagement with the problem of participation in its technological,
   social and political dimensions especially considering the increasing
   centralization and specialization of scientific and technological
   expertise. The authors also discuss and reflect on the Public Lab's
   approach to civic science in light of ideas and practices of
   citizen/civic veillance, or ``sousveillance{''}, by emphasizing people
   before data, and by investigating the new ways of seeing and doing that
   this shift in perspective might provide.}},

Abstract = {{The kinematic studies the motion of a particle without considering the
   effects that produce movement, while the dynamics studies the factors
   that produce changes in a system. It proposes the establishment of
   measuring equipment that can record physical parameters focused on the
   kinematics and dynamics, using the equations deducted from the
   calculation for the movement, by modifying travel distance, angle of
   inclination and mass of the objects. The measurement of the time will be
   used to obtain the uncertainty in the experiments, the dispersion of the
   available data is related to the size of the sample and the procedure
   used. In the indirect measurements were used equations due to the
   correlation in the physical variables for the analysis of uncertainty.
   One of the methods for uncertainty analysis is based on the statistical
   analysis, another way to estimate this is through experience or external
   information available. The experiments made in the inclined plane for
   the study of the velocity, acceleration and force of friction to angles
   greater than 15 degrees, showed a relative error of 1.8\% in the time
   variable, the standard uncertainty had a normal distribution with a
   confidence level of 95\%.}},

Abstract = {{To be able to use robots of the same type in a swarm (in this case
   differential-drive robots) from a centralized computer, you need to
   control them in the same way even if the robots come from different
   manuf acturers. These robots should have the same capabilities: i.e. the
   same type of sensors and the same type of control commands. Currently,
   if we need to add sensors on a robot, we should first find out what are
   the hardware capabilities and what are the tools provided by the
   manufacturer (some have microcontrollers, others have ARM processors).
   The protocol to communicate with the onboard card (often a serial
   protocol) is different for each robot and we have to take that in
   account in our software so that the robots can be interchangeable.
   This paper describes the design and the results of using a standard
   interface (bridge) on a robot which allows wireless communication with a
   centralized computer and local serial communication with a mobile robot.
   On this interface, we can connect every sensor we want (infrared,
   ultrasound, laser, Kinect etc.) and we can always use the same tools to
   control them.
   Extension of the protocol of the Kobuki base (TurtleBot 2) is proposed
   to be able to use the same type of frame as the TurtleBot 2 uses and to
   continue to use ROS middleware as is, but with the possibility to use
   data from new sensors implemented on the bridge. This article will focus
   on the use of the TurtleBot 2, but the same bridge will be adapted to
   other robots allowing their interchangeability in the future.}},

   mechanical characterization of thin films and papers}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 29}},
Abstract = {{The cost of specialized scientific equipment can be high and with
   limited funding resources, researchers and students are often unable to
   access or purchase the ideal equipment for their projects. In the fields
   of materials science and mechanical engineering, fundamental equipment
   such as tensile testing devices can cost tens to hundreds of thousands
   of dollars. While a research lab often has access to a large-scale
   testing machine suitable for conventional samples, loading devices for
   meso-and micro-scale samples for in-situ testing with the myriad of
   microscopy tools are often hard to source and cost prohibitive.
   Open-source software has allowed for great strides in the reduction of
   costs associated with software development and open-source hardware and
   additive manufacturing have the potential to similarly reduce the costs
   of scientific equipment and increase the accessibility of scientific
   research. To investigate the feasibility of open-source hardware, a
   micro-tensile tester was designed with a freely accessible
   computer-aided design package and manufactured with a desktop 3D-printer
   and off-the-shelf components. To our knowledge this is one of the first
   demonstrations of a tensile tester with additively manufactured
   components for scientific research. The capabilities of the tensile
   tester were demonstrated by investigating the mechanical properties of
   Graphene Oxide (GO) paper and thin films. A 3D printed tensile tester
   was successfully used in conjunction with an atomic force microscope to
   provide one of the first quantitative measurements of GO thin film
   buckling under compression. The tensile tester was also used in
   conjunction with an atomic force microscope to observe the change in
   surface topology of a GO paper in response to increasing tensile strain.
   No significant change in surface topology was observed in contrast to
   prior hypotheses from the literature. Based on this result obtained with
   the new open source tensile stage we propose an alternative hypothesis
   we term `superlamellae consolidation' to explain the initial deformation
   of GO paper. The additively manufactured tensile tester tested
   represents cost savings of > 99\% compared to commercial solutions in
   its class and offers simple customization. However, continued
   development is needed for the tensile tester presented here to approach
   the technical specifications achievable with commercial solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Fog computing is gaining attention due to the potential of aggregating
   and processing time-sensitive data at the nearby intelligent gateways.
   It reduces the latency of sensors data aggregation and response time
   therefore, improve real-time action which is beneficial in environmental
   monitoring and early warning systems. However, deploying edge computing
   in Internet-less environment seems unpractical and the mobility of
   gateways is less focused in current literature. In this paper, we
   present a practical design of a portable gateways scheme for sensors
   data aggregation and processing in Internet-less environment. The
   proposed gateways can locate their geographical locations which can be
   automatically converted into location names at the central gateway. The
   proposed portable Fog Gateways are developed by using open-source
   hardware and integrated with Cloud database for data storage. Data
   processing techniques such as data parsing and Reverse Geocoding are
   conducted for reliable data transmission by using GSM/GPRS technology
   and geographical location name detection respectively. Finally, a case
   study has been conducted to evaluate the feasibility of our proposed Fog
   Gateways scheme in real-time application.}},

Abstract = {{1. The cost, usability and power efficiency of available wildlife
   monitoring equipment currently inhibits full ground-level coverage of
   many natural systems. Developments over the last decade in technology,
   open science, and the sharing economy promise to bring global access to
   more versatile and more affordable monitoring tools, to improve coverage
   for conservation researchers and managers.
   2. Here we describe the development and proof-of-concept of a low-cost,
   small-sized and low-energy acoustic detector: ``AudioMoth.{''} The
   device is open-source and programmable, with diverse applications for
   recording animal calls or human activity at sample rates of up to 384
   kHz. We briefly outline two ongoing real-world case studies of
   large-scale, long-term monitoring for biodiversity and exploitation of
   natural resources. These studies demonstrate the potential for AudioMoth
   to enable a substantial shift away from passive continuous recording by
   individual devices, towards smart detection by networks of devices
   flooding large and inaccessible ecosystems.
   3. The case studies demonstrate one of the smart capabilities of
   AudioMoth, to trigger event logging on the basis of classification
   algorithms that identify specific acoustic events. An algorithm to
   trigger recordings of the New Forest cicada (Cicadetta montana)
   demonstrates the potential for AudioMoth to vastly improve the spatial
   and temporal coverage of surveys for the presence of cryptic animals. An
   algorithm for logging gunshot events has potential to identify a shotgun
   blast in tropical rainforest at distances of up to 500 m, extending to 1
   km with continuous recording.
   4. AudioMoth is more energy efficient than currently available passive
   acoustic monitoring devices, giving it considerably greater portability
   and longevity in the field with smaller batteries. At a build cost of
   similar to US\$43 per unit, AudioMoth has potential for varied
   applications in large-scale, long-term acoustic surveys. With continuing
   developments in smart, energy-efficient algorithms and diminishing
   component costs, we are approaching the milestone of local communities
   being able to afford to remotely monitor their own natural resources.}},

Abstract = {{Scientific communities are drawn to the open source model as an

   Increasing convenience of 3D printing has fueled the proliferation of
   open labware projects aiming to develop and share designs for scientific
   tools that can be produced in-house as inexpensive alternatives to
   commercial products. We present our design of a micropipette that is
   assembled from 3D-printable parts and some hardware that works by
   actuating a disposable syringe to a user-adjustable limit. Graduations
   on the syringe are used to accurately adjust the set point to the
   desired volume. Our open design printed micropipette is assessed in
   comparison with a commercial pipette and meets the ISO 8655 standards.}},

Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Applications involving data acquisition from sensors need samples at a
   preset frequency rate, the filtering out of noise and/or analysis of
   certain frequency components. We propose a novel software architecture
   based on open-software hardware platforms which allows programmers to
   create data streams from input channels and easily implement filters and
   frequency analysis objects. The performances of the different classes
   given in the size of memory allocated and execution time (number of
   clock cycles) were analyzed in the low-cost platform Arduino Genuino. In
   addition, 11 people took part in an experiment in which they had to
   implement several exercises and complete a usability test. Sampling
   rates under 250 Hz (typical for many biomedical applications) makes it
   feasible to implement filters, sliding windows and Fourier analysis,
   operating in real time. Participants rated software usability at 70.2
   out of 100 and the ease of use when implementing several signal
   processing applications was rated at just over 4.4 out of 5.
   Participants showed their intention of using this software because it
   was percieved as useful and very easy to use. The performances of the
   library showed that it may be appropriate for implementing small
   biomedical real-time applications or for human movement monitoring, even
   in a simple open-source hardware device like Arduino Genuino. The
   general perception about this library is that it is easy to use and
   intuitive.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal Pyranometers are very important devices for evaluating the
   intensity of solar radiation under different climatic conditions. These
   devices utilize thermal radiation for comparison and determination of
   their efficiency. Because of this wide use associated with the
   development of new technologies, a simple and low-cost version of
   thermal pyranometer has been studied, designed and manufactured. A
   blackened aluminum disk is used as a hot junction, and the cold junction
   is exposed to ambient air. The two terminals are connected to a digital
   amplifier with output signal directed to an Arduino board. A device
   calibration was performed by comparing the results with a commercial
   photodiode sensor. Statistical analysis of the calibration data
   considering a 99\% confidence level leads to an estimated standard error
   of 20.8 W/m(2). An analysis of its response time also estimated from a
   dynamic model. This model uses a numerical solution of the energy
   balance on heat exchange between the aluminum disc and the environment.
   The instrument response time based on the average of the estimates
   obtained from the dynamic model is about 1.5 minutes. Based on these
   studies it was concluded that the characteristics of the sensor are
   adequate for most solar energy tests and the final cost of US \$ 60.00
   is much lower than the large majority of such commercial devices.}},

   semiconductor processing}},
Journal = {{ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{20}},
Pages = {{90-100}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Slot die coating is growing in popularity because it is a low
   operational cost and easily scaled processing technique for depositing
   thin and uniform films rapidly, while minimizing material waste. The
   complex inner geometry of conventional slot dies require expensive
   machining that limits accessibility and experimentation. In order to
   overcome these issues this study follows an open hardware approach,
   which uses an open source 3-D printer to both fabricate the slot die and
   then to functionalize a 3-D slot die printing system. Polymer materials
   are tested and selected for compatibility with common solvents and used
   to fabricate a custom slot die head. This slot die is then integrated
   into a 3-D printer augmented with a syringe pump to form an additive
   manufacturing platform for thin film semiconductor devices. The full
   design of the slot die system is disclosed here using an open source
   license including software and operational protocols. This study
   demonstrates that functional lab-grade slot dies may be 3-D printed
   using low-cost open source hardware methods A case study using NiO2
   found an RMS value 0.486 nm, thickness of 17-49 nm, and a maximum
   optical transmission of 99.1\%, which shows this additive manufacturing
   approach to slot die depositions as well of fabrication is capable of
   producing viable layers of advanced electronic materials. Using this
   method, a cost savings of over 17,000\% was obtained when compared to
   commercial slot die systems for laboratories. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs) are increasingly being
   deployed for surveillance and monitoring applications. WMSNs
   applications produce large amount of data, which require high
   transmission rates. An efficient and seamless delivery of multimedia
   services in WMSNs is still a challenging task. This article proposes an
   intelligent video surveillance platform (IVSP) for wireless multimedia
   sensor networks. IVSP presents the design of a networked system for
   joint rate control and error control of video over resource-constrained
   embedded devices. First, a combination of two different congestion
   indicators is introduced to differentiate between congestion levels and
   handle them accordingly. Second, a feedback-based rate controller is
   developed to maximize received video quality, in which sensor nodes can
   adaptively adjust their sending rates. Finally, a different
   retransmission mechanism for different packets is proposed. Lost packets
   can be stored temporarily and resend when free channel is available to
   avoid congestion. The core component of IVSP is an open source hardware
   platform, which is based on Raspberry Pi sensor nodes. IVSP is
   extensively evaluated on 7 Raspberry Pi sensor nodes. We present the
   results of 7-node real-world deployment of IVSP in a video surveillance
   application and show that it works well in long-term deployments.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Currently, Internet of Things (IoT) technologies are used in many areas,
   such as intelligent transportation, smart city, hospital, games,
   education. Earlier interactive response system uses infrared or radio
   frequency (RF) wireless communication technologies to transmit the
   students' answer to teachers' managerment system, where there exists
   high cost, inconvenient usage, difficult deployment. How to use IoT to
   improve the quality of higher education becomes a very important topic
   in the researh area of teaching. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
   is one of key technologies to implement IoT applications, and most of
   universities use the High Frequency (HF) RFID card as the students'
   identification devices in China. In this paper, a kind of WiFi supported
   RFID reader (WiRF) is implemented using open source hardware platforms,
   such as Node MCU and RFID-RC522. Then the proposed WiRF system is used
   to assist teacher to perform automatic attendance record and students'
   behavior record. In addition, Quick Response (QR) code is another
   technology to enable IoT. In this paper, QR code is designed to quickly
   access course video and perform real-time interactive response in the
   classroom, which will provide multidimensional learning and strengthen
   the motivation of students' learning. This IoT system can improve the
   attendance of students, and give a positive impact on students' learning
   process for higher education.}},

Abstract = {{Addressing the navigation (localization and motion control) problem of a
   mobile robot, coupled with its mapping problem, remains a significant
   challenge to date. The well-known simultaneous localization and mapping
   problem of mobile robots has been addressed in the literaturewithout
   specifically taking into account the robot's motion control tasks.
   Moreover, its implementation can cost more than the robot itself. Robot
   motion control strategies developed in the literature either 1) rely on
   sophisticated hardware platforms, 2) assume noise-free environment, or
   3) are based on abstract theories, which are validated using computer
   simulations only. The current work solves the navigation and mapping
   problems of mobile robots using open-source hardware and range-only
   measurements from a network of radio sources. The hardware platform used
   in this work is customized such that it is cost-effective and
   easy-to-implement, addressing the aforementioned issues in developing
   motion control strategies. The current strategy permits the robot to
   estimate its position and orientation and builds a map of its operating
   environment using radio frequency signals received from radio sources.
   It then navigates through a path defined by a set of two-dimensional
   points on the ground using a motion control strategy in cooperation with
   a computational intelligence tool. The proposed robot navigation and
   mapping scheme was tested in an indoor laboratory environment and its
   performance was compared with the simulation counterpart using a
   commercial robot simulator.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the design and development of a low cost building
   environmental monitoring system, and it is based on Open Source
   Platforms and on the Internet of Things. To achieve this aim, a wireless
   micro-controller with attached sensors has been used to collect the
   environmental data. The information obtained from the sensors is
   collected and stored in a flash memory card, and simultaneously is sent
   via WiFi to the cloud. This data is stored in an online spreadsheet,
   which permits us to access the information in real time.
   On the other hand, a comparative analysis of the results obtained from
   sensors has been carried out, thanks to which several guidance
   guidelines have been developed for the selection of the most appropriate
   environmental sensor for each project. Finally, an additional evaluation
   of the device has been carried out through the analysis of its energy
   performance and providing information related to the data storage and
   its cost of development.
   The current research shows a clear ability to develop monitoring systems
   for the building sector, which can also be extended to multiple
   applications of Smart Environments. The development of projects through
   these platforms will allow future research to tackle the existing
   barriers in monitoring campaigns.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid manufacturing using 3-D printing is a potential solution to some
   of the most pressing issues for humanitarian logistics. In this paper,
   findings are reported from a study that involved development of a new
   type of 3-D printer. In particular, a novel 3-D printer that is designed
   specifically for reliable rapid manufacturing at the sites of
   humanitarian crises. First, required capabilities are developed with
   design elements of a humanitarian 3-D printer, which include, (1) fused
   filament fabrication, (2) open source self-replicating rapid prototyper
   design, (3) modular, (4) separate frame, (5) protected electronics, (6)
   on-board computing, (7) flexible power supply, and (8) climate control
   mechanisms. The technology is then disclosed with an open source license
   for the Kijenzi 3-D Printer. A swarm of five Kijenzi 3-D printers are
   evaluated for rapid part manufacturing for two months at health
   facilities and other community locations in both rural and urban areas
   throughout Kisumu County, Kenya. They were successful for their ability
   to function independently of infrastructure, transportability, ease of
   use, ability to withstand harsh environments and costs. The results are
   presented and conclusions are drawn about future work necessary for the
   Kijenzi 3-D Printer to meet the needs of rapid manufacturing in a
   humanitarian context.}},

Abstract = {{Major cloud service providers, including Amazon and Microsoft, have
   started employing field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to build
   high-performance and low-power-consumption cloud capability. However,
   utilizing an FPGA-enabled cloud is still challenging because of two main
   reasons. First, the introduction of software and hardware co-design
   leads to high development complexity. Second, FPGA virtualization and
   accelerator scheduling techniques are not fully researched for cluster
   deployment. In this paper, we propose an open-source FPGA-as-a-service
   (FaaS) platform, the hCODE, to simplify the design, management and
   deployment of FPGA accelerators at cluster scale. The proposed platform
   implements a Shell-and-IP design pattern and an open accelerator
   repository to reduce design and management costs of FPGA projects.
   Efficient FPGA virtualization and accelerator scheduling techniques are
   proposed to deploy accelerators on the FPGA-enabled cluster easily. With
   the proposed hCODE, hardware designers and accelerator users can be
   organized on one platform to efficiently build open-hardware ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the effect of web based power electronics courses on the
   success of electrical engineering candidates was examined. The
   participants are consisted of daytime education (30) and evening
   education (42) students who attended the ``Power Electronics{''} course.
   First, groups were randomly assigned as experimental and control groups
   and experimental group and control group were examined according to the
   students' GPAs, university entrance exam results, academic grades
   depending on 8 different lectures related with power electronics.
   According to the results obtained from validity and reliability of Power
   Electronics Course Achievement Test, the total correlation values and
   the standard deviation values of Power Electronics Course Achievement
   Test were between.301-,.598 and between.304-,.506, respectively. In
   addition, KR20 coefficient was found as 0.844. Before application of the
   ``Power Electronics Course Achievement Test{''}, there was not a
   significant difference in total scores of both daytime and evening
   education students. Although students received Web-Based Education and
   Web Aided Education were selected as experimental group, the students

Abstract = {{The current ongoing work of the CubeSat Development Initiative is to
   build a small spacecraft system using open source software and open
   hardware principles. The main objective of the development is to give
   access to space for little payloads, which can be planned and executed
   by researchers, designers and even understudies majoring in science,
   technology, engineering, and math and different orders to play out a
   huge number of planned missions. To design and develop any system,
   requirement engineering plays a vital role as it describes the
   functional and non-functional requirements of the system. The work
   presented in this paper is focused on developing a requirement
   engineering tool that can be used to increase the requirement
   elicitation and specification of system-wide qualities based on the use
   of quality attribute scenarios. The model-based requirement engineering
   tool described in the paper allows to link non-functional requirements
   and functional requirements. It utilizes quality attribute scenarios
   (templates) which are proposed by Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering
   Institute (SEI).}},

Abstract = {{Air quality has become a serious concern from the world's leading
   universities. The campus as a learning area needs good air quality and
   needs to monitor and maintain it so that academics can engage in healthy
   and optimal activities. This study develops a system for monitoring
   outdoor air quality on campus by using a wireless sensor network (WSN).
   MQTT Protocol is used to maximize data transmission from sensor nodes to
   brokers via wireless local area network (WLAN). Air quality measurement
   data is reported in real time via a web server that can be accessed via
   the internet. Sensor nodes and brokers are built using open source
   hardware and software. The system is implemented for measuring air
   quality on campus and shows measurements that are accurate, real time,
   and can be accessed via the web.}},

Abstract = {{In developing countries like India, the school and college education
   systems are mired in the passive, teacher-centric pedagogy based on rote
   learning. Active, student-centric STEAM (science, technology,

   affordable open source hardware and free open source software to foster
   innovation and creativity among teachers and students in colleges and
   universities as well as schools. In particular, build your own and
   do-it-yourself (BYO/DIY) robots and tabletop subtractive and additive
   manufacturing machines can be designed, fabricated and disseminated for
   hands-on education in design, electronics, programming, robotics and
   manufacturing. This paper discusses an ongoing collaborative project
   between a higher educational institution, a non-profit foundation and a
   corporate sponsor to establish and operate project-based STEAM learning
   labs in resource-poor government high schools in nine Indian cities. The
   work reported is the schools outreach part of a Teaching Learning Centre
   for design, development and dissemination of low-cost manufacturing
   education technologies for engineering colleges and universities. The

Abstract = {{This research explores the real-time process control of polymer
   flowability in Powder Bed Fusion (PBF). To do so, a novel system based
   on machine vision and an image-processing algorithm was developed and
   tested in an open hardware and software PBF system. The system has the
   ability to analyze the quality of the powder bed by computing a defect
   ratio of the powder bed after each recoating operation. Then, this ratio
   is used as a performance variable in three full factorial Design of
   Experiments (DOE). The results show that the installation of machine
   vision and image processing system can potentially provide a signal to
   repeat the recoating process and correct the defect on the powder bed.
   At the same time, recoating process parameters can be adjusted
   dynamically to guarantee an optimum quality of the powder bed and
   minimize possible build failures.}},

   environmental monitoring station, the S3ME2, with a multitude of sensors
   capable of operating in extreme environments (from cold arid sub -arctic

   realtime quality data of ctitical climate and geophysical parameters for
   a wide field of research such as pressure, surface and subsurface
   temperature and llimidity, magnetic field and seismic activity-. The
   dedicated communication modem utilizes loT technolo{*}, and can deliver
   this data from remote regions. The S3ME2 has been designed as a low-cost
   instrument to facilitate the production of multiple units. During the
   pilot phase, it has demonstrated continuous operability for up to 6
   months, including survival (luting extremely cold, snowy, and low
   insolation, and low wind periods in the Sub -Arctic region. With its
   robust desim, S3ME2 exploits the use of renewable sources of enert,,,y
   such as solar and wind power to power the system. The S3ME2 has also
   been desigited from a modular point of view with commercial off the

Abstract = {{It has been identified from literature that affordability is the main
   constraint faced by the majority of MANET (Mobile Ad-hoc Network)
   researchers which sees them forgoing implementing real world
   experimental studies that are costlier, in favour of opting for cheaper
   simulation tools instead. While simulation tools provide a simple and
   inexpensive method to gain an understanding of algorithms and protocols
   in MANET research, its reliability and accuracy in representing real
   systems and contexts are critically limited. Thus, this paper unveils
   the ToMRobot, created with low budget using ordinary remote control (RC)
   car coupled with a few low cost electronic components, to serve as a
   fully functional MANET testbed. Provided in this paper are practical
   knowhow to model and produce ToMRobot from scratch specifically targeted
   to facilitate less technical savvy MANET researchers. Despite being
   really economical, significantly inexpensive to create, highly
   customizable with flexible option that allows researchers to upgrade by
   utilizing components such as Arduino and Cubieboard2 from technologies
   that can be sourced from open hardware, ToMRobot still maintains all
   aspects of MANET rudimentary structures. It is hoped that the guidelines
   contained within this paper will help MANET researchers to build robots
   that can be used in their future MANET testbeds, which will in turn
   ultimately increase the number of MANET researchers who choose testbeds
   as their evaluation tool.}},

Abstract = {{Recent years demonstrate an increased interest in low-cost Passive
   Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) in citizen science for ecological monitoring
   and environmental protection. However, most efforts have targeted land
   use, leaving ocean and nautical applications greatly unexplored. In this
   paper we present the design, deployment and testing of POSEIDON, a
   low-cost PAM system for nautical citizen science and real-time acoustic
   augmentation of whale-watching experiences. POSEIDON uses machine
   learning techniques to identify vocal acoustic samples of common
   cetaceans like whales and dolphins. When discriminating the calls, we
   find that Extra Trees and Gradient Boosting outperform other classifiers
   (>0.95 confidence threshold). The features extracted from the machine
   learning models are used to enhance the whale watching experience and
   provide citizen science data to marine biologists and environmental
   protection agencies. While this paper focuses on the design of the
   system, future work will focus on user testing and widespread deployment
   of open-hardware and software for nautical PAM applications.}},

Abstract = {{The recent emergence of open hardware platforms has drastically reduced
   the cost required to develop special purpose device architectures. The
   RISC-V instruction set and associated ecosystem is one such architecture
   that has become widely popular as the basis for the next generation
   embedded control systems and IoT devices.
   Despite the recent popularity of the RISC-V architecture, there is
   currently very little support for performing architectural experiments
   of high performance RISC-V devices designed to target high performance
   computing and high performance analytics applications. Further, there
   are no general purpose simulation infrastructures that support
   developing architectural experiments using RISC-V cores coupled to
   emerging memory devices such as HBM and HMC. As a result, there is
   currently a significant gap for those seeking to develop high
   performance architectural models using emerging memory devices and the
   RISC-V instruction set.
   The Stake infrastructure is designed to provide integrated simulation
   capabilities that supports experimentation using RISC-V processing cores
   as well as emerging memory devices. Stake is constructed using a fusion
   of the existing RISC-V Spike functional simulation infrastructure
   coupled to a custom memory generation component within the Sandia
   Structural Simulation (SST) framework. The result being an integrated
   simulation infrastructure that has the ability to simulate heterogeneous
   mixtures of hierarchical caches, traditional DRAM memories and emerging
   memory devices. We demonstrate this infrastructure with a design study
   to elicit the efficacy of 64 bit RISC-V cores on executing graph
   applications using different mixtures of cache, DRAM memories and HMC
   memories. In this study, we utilize the Graph Analytics Benchmark Suite
   to drive simulated memory traffic into mixtures of single level and
   multi-level caches coupled to each of the aforementioned backend memory
   devices. From this, we determine that in our simulated architecture, the
   HMC memory configuration with a single (L1) caching layer provides the
   most advantageous system configuration for executing graph algorithms
   and applications.}},

Abstract = {{Open Source Hardware (OSH) products are those whose design are made
   publicly available so that anyone can study, modify, distribute, make,
   and sell them. In spite of the increasing popularity of this novel
   approach to intellectual property in product innovation, practice
   communities have faced difficulties to refine this concept into sharp
   and practical terms. There is to date no widely acknowledged criteria
   for determining whether a product is open source or not. Assuming OSH
   follows the same development path as Open Source Software and becomes a
   mainstream approach, the issue of conformance will also become critical
   for both producers and consumers. To address this gap, this contribution
   introduces a self-declared product openness marking scheme allowing to
   rate the openness of a product. Looking forward, it provides conceptual
   inputs for the future establishment of technical standards bringing
   clarity in this emerging and moving field. (C) 2018 The Authors.

   of the rapid emergence of new technologies, intersection of computing
   with other disciplines and growing interest among students in computing

   approaches. One of these approaches is the integration of hardware
   prototyping platforms such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi and Intel Internet
   of Things as part of project-based learning. These platforms have become
   in recent years instrumental tools for improving students' learning

   investigate the usefulness of integrating low cost open-source hardware
   platforms into engineering and computer science courses. In particular,
   we explore the use of an experiential learning approach using these kits
   for improving the students' learning experience in computer science and
   engineering courses. Throughout this paper, we discuss the outcome of
   our investigation and provide insights on how to make classrooms more

Abstract = {{This full paper proposes an educational methodology to teaching and
   learning of programming using both open hardware tools and industrial
   components such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, three phase motors and
   variable speed drives. The methodology aims to improve the algorithmic
   thinking in the students due to the deficiencies detected in it, as well
   as, it searches that the students learn a second programming language,
   using hands-on designs and activities that require the components
   mentioned. In addition, the methodology has been employed into the
   curriculum of a course of programming known as (open hardware) for
   students of technology in electronics (n=22), observing that the
   students learn programming concepts in a better way and their motivation
   and engagement towards the software area was increased during the
   course. To technical level, the methodology uses the programming
   language Python in order to interact with the different ports,
   peripherals and utilities of the platforms mentioned, creating a link
   between these elements and the aspects concerning the software design,
   e.g., data types, classes, methods or Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs).
   Finally, the methodology takes into account two important aspects,
   firstly, the skills developed by the students in the proposal are
   involved into the BoK (Body of Knowledge) of different engineering areas
   as embedded systems, control and computer science and, secondly,
   programming is perhaps one of the most difficult areas in engineering
   but in turn, it has a ubiquitous nature in the areas mentioned.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we attempt to design a dataglove to assist sign language
   users communicate with non-users. We focus our work on designing a low
   cost dataglove using open source hardware and software. We run
   algorithms on the micro controller to interpret basic gestures and
   phrases. The interpretat ` results are sent wirelessly to a bluetooth
   enabled smartphone to be displayed on screen. We benchmark the
   interpretation accuracy on three different users. Our results show that
   most basic sign gestures can be interpreted rather accurately using only
   simple algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Computational methods for the enhancement of energy efficiency rely on a
   measurement process with sufficient accuracy and number of measurements.
   Networked energy meters, energy monitors, serve as vital link between
   energy consumption of households and key insights that reveal strategies
   to achieve significant energy savings. During the design of such an
   energy monitor, several aspects such as data update rate or variety of
   measured physical quantities have to be considered. This paper
   introduces YoMoPie, a user-oriented energy monitor based on the
   Raspberry Pi platform that aims to enable intelligent energy services in
   households. YoMoPie measures active as well as apparent power, stores
   data locally, and integrates an easy to use Python library. Furthermore,
   the presented energy monitor comes with a Python API enabling the
   execution of user-designed services to enhance energy efficiency in
   buildings and households. Along with the presented design, possible
   applications that could run on top of this system such as residential
   demand response, immediate user feedback, smart meter data analytics, or
   energy disaggregation are discussed. Finally, a case study is presented,
   which compares the measurement accuracy of YoMoPie to a certified energy
   analyser for a selection of common household appliances.}},

Abstract = {{MANET (Mobile Ad Hoc Network) researchers have shown increased interest
   in using mobile robot technology for their testbed platforms. Thus, the
   main motivation of this paper is to review various robot-based MANET
   testbeds that have been developed in previously reported research.
   Additionally, suggestions to heighten mobility mechanisms by using
   mobile robots to be more practical, easy and inexpensive are also
   included in this paper, as we unveils ToMRobot, a low-cost MANET robot
   created from an ordinary remote control car that is capable of
   performing a real system MANET testbed with the addition of only a few
   low-cost electronic components. Despite greatly reduced costs, the
   ToMRobot does not sacrifice any of the necessary MANET basic structures
   and will still be easily customisable and upgradeable through the use of
   open hardware technology like Cubieboard2 and Arduino, as its robot
   controller. This paper will also include guidelines to enable
   technically limited MANET researchers to design and develop the
   ToMRobot. It is hoped that this paper achieves its two pronged
   objectives namely (i) to facilitate other MANET researchers by providing
   them with a source of reference that eases their decision making for
   selecting the best and most suitable MANET mobile robots for real
   mobility in their MANET testbeds (ii) to provide MANET researchers with
   a prospect of building their own MANET robots that can be applied in
   their own MANET testbed in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Robotic automation is considered as the fourth industrial revolution by
   multiple industrialists. Robots are faster, more accurate, less
   error-prone and cost-effective when compared to human beings. For big
   companies, it is estimated that by 2025, labor cost savings from the
   adoption of advanced industrial robots would surpass 20\%. However, for
   small and medium companies, industrial robots are still expensive and
   unaffordable. Fortunately, with the advent of Internet of Things (IoT),
   artificial intelligence, open source hardware and software, and the
   declining price of electronic components, a new generation of smaller,
   cheaper and friendlier robots are emerging, for small and medium
   businesses. In this paper, we propose the simulation of an Indoor
   Positioning System (IPS) robot, which performs a forklift operation in a
   warehouse. The system uses Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
   technology, and Java programming language for exchanging data from a
   server. An ESP8266 NodeMCU module, an Arduino microcontroller and
   various components such as MFRC522 to read RFID tags, Ultrasonic Sensors
   HC-SR04 for detecting obstacles are used. This resulted in a very low
   cost, reliable and multifunctional system. Simulations have demonstrated
   that the mobile robot can transmit packets over the network to a local
   server for mapping without losses. Moreover, it can receive packets from
   the server to obtain destination points and mapping obstacles while
   moving around the RFID tagged floor.}},

Abstract = {{The complexity and heterogeneity of digital devices used in embedded
   systems is increasing everyday and delivering a bug-free design is still
   a very complex task. The interest for open-source hardware in real
   products is demanding for tools and advanced methodologies for
   verification to provide high reliability to open and free IPs. In this
   work, an open-source evolutionary optimizer has been used to create
   functional test programs that improve the verification test set for an
   open-source microprocessor, enhancing in this way, the verification
   level of the device. The verification programs are generated to optimize
   code coverage metrics and are tested against a high-level model to find
   device incorrectnesses during the generation time. A perturbation
   mechanism has been included in the verification framework to cover parts
   of the device under verification not reachable with only software
   stimuli such as interrupts or memory stalls. The proposed methodology
   uncovered 10 bugs still present in the RTL description of the analyzed
   device and demonstrated the effectiveness of open-source verification
   tools for the next generation of open-source RISC-V microprocessors.}},

Abstract = {{Easy-to-use and affordable means of production (e.g. 3D printer), access
   to these technologies (e.g. in makerspaces) and powerful tools for
   online product design led to the emergence of open source hardware
   (OSH). Like in open source software, projects and online platforms have
   been evolving around physical products from various technologies where
   people jointly develop and freely share designs. We also find businesses
   that sell products made from these designs and offer complimentary
   services. This decentralized and collaborative model of value creation
   offers new opportunities for social, economic and ecological
   sustainability, but also calls for a different understanding beyond
   traditional notions. Results from an exploratory study on OSH projects
   and companies revealed that licensing is a critical issue, communities
   and partners play a key role in the open source ecosystem and modes of
   value creation are either centered around design or production in
   combination with a mix of complimentary services.}},

Abstract = {{Long-range (LoRa) radio technologies have recently gained momentum in
   the IoT landscape, allowing low-power communications over distances up
   to several kilometers. As a result, more and more LoRa networks are
   being deployed. However, commercially available LoRa devices are
   expensive and propriety, creating a barrier to entry and possibly
   slowing down developments and deployments of novel applications. Using
   open-source hardware and software platforms would allow more developers
   to test and build intelligent devices resulting in a better overall
   development ecosystem, lower barriers to entry, and rapid growth in the
   number of IoT applications. Toward this goal, this paper presents the
   design, implementation, and evaluation of KRATOS, a low-cost LoRa
   platform running ContikiOS. Both, our hardware and software designs are
   released as an open source to the research community.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional manufacturing systems consist of devices with limited
   functionality and are constructed in a vertical structure. This is not
   suitable for smart factory environment where Internet of Things (IoT) is
   actively utilized and connected to external environment. Cyber Physical
   System (CPS), a key element of the Smart Factory, means that cyber and
   physical systems are tightly connected and intelligent. To build a CPS,
   IoT needs to be handled effectively, and stability and connectivity must
   be ensured. Therefore, the system in the Smart Factory is preferably
   built according to the loT standard. hi this paper, we propose an
   industrial device monitoring and control system based on oneM2M, and
   discuss that this system can be applied in a smart factory environment.
   The proposed system is based on Mobius, developed by Korea Electronics
   Technology Institute (KETI) as an open source IoT platform, and its
   components are open source hardware which is high performance with low
   cost. The Smart Factory system can be constructed in various forms using
   Mobius. In this paper, a model for its structure and utilization is
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{A robotic platform is essential to validate any algorithm developed for
   mobile robotics research, as usually simulation results does not reflect
   all the real world circumstances and error sources. Nowadays there are
   several available commercial solutions that can be used to validate the
   developed algorithms, but they are usually expensive and closed to
   hardware modifications. Another option is to build the robotic platform,
   but while these solutions are normally open hardware and can be easily
   modified and maintained, many are assembled using low cost components
   and are intended only for robot education, and for this reason are not
   suitable for advanced algorithm implementation nor can employ advanced
   sensors. A possible solution is presented in this paper, in which an
   open hardware modular omnidirectional platform is developed, with robust
   hardware implementation using modular commercially available components,
   at a lower cost that some more expensive available solutions, but with
   similar performance and capabilities being suitable for mobile robot
   research and experimentation.}},

Abstract = {{Soft wearable robots comprised of deformable materials have recently
   attracted much attention in the field of applications for its lightness
   and elasticity. However, there exist some limitation to the control of
   wearable robots due to the complexity of the model and the conditions of
   the wearer. In this paper, we propose a learning-based position control
   method of soft wearable glove using a deep neural network (DNN). To
   analyze our proposed method, we fabricated a soft pneumatic glove and a
   control board for the glove based on open hardware platform data. With
   our developed system, we collected the pressure and position data of the
   soft glove using a Leap Motion sensor to train our soft glove position
   network (SGPN). Along with our proposed DNN model, we could enable
   open-loop control on the joint positions of the soft glove by supplying
   pressure to the actuator without prior knowledge of the wearer or the
   wearable robot such as hand size of the wearer or the stiffness of
   pneumatic actuator.}},

   source hardware development as a methodology that fulfills demands for
   mass customization. In the open source hardware development, project
   owner offers platform sources and individual developers separately
   develop various functional modules based on the given platform sources.
   Then customers will choose each module which best meets their needs.
   Second, the evaluation model for the open source hardware platform will
   be suggested. For open source hardware development, developers'
   participation is one of the key factors in successful project
   management. Developers will consider both estimated development costs
   and market size to make a decision on participation. With all these
   concerns, we built a platform evaluation model for open source hardware
   projects in terms of how much it boosts the developers' participation.}},

Abstract = {{Physiological (or biosignal) data acquisition and analysis has evolved
   from being intrinsically bound to medical practice or lab settings, to
   become a pervasive data source with numerous applications. This has been
   mostly leveraged by the proliferation of wearables and open hardware
   platforms. While the first devices offer good cloud connectivity (albeit
   to proprietary servers) but only provide high-level features, the latter
   have opposite characteristics, creating a gap in what concerns
   collaborative access to datasets for reuse in academic research. In this
   paper we describe a module devised to help bridge this gap, by enabling
   real-time biosignal streaming directly from an open hardware
   physiological data acquisition platform to a cloud-based repository over
   Wi-Fi. Performance tests have been made to assess the data transmission
   reliability, and the adopted approach to the repository enables
   user-friendly collaborative access, visualisation and sharing of the
   recorded data.}},

   example to establish causal links between neurons and behaviorin a
   closed-loop fashion. Cells or group of cells can be triggered by
   acoustical, electrical or light impulses. This last case is based on a
   technique defined as optogenetics. The latter is used in an example that
   reads and controls neuronal activity of a population of neurons in
   laboratory rats forcing them to transition between neuronal states,

Abstract = {{The open-source hardware movement is becoming increasingly popular due
   to the emergence of successful low-cost technologies, such as Arduino
   and Raspberry Pi, and thanks to the community of makers that actively
   share their creations to be freely studied, modified, and

   this approach for accomplishing a variety of learning goals: enabling
   scholars to explore scientific concepts, promoting students' creativity,
   helping them to be more fluent and expressive with new technologies, and
   so on. This paper reports a systematic mapping study that overviews the
   literature on open-source hardware in education by analyzing and
   classifying 676 publications. The results of our work provide: 1)
   guidance on the published material (identifying the most relevant
   papers, publication sources, institutions, and countries); 2)
   information about the pedagogical uses of open-source hardware (showing
   its main educational goals, stages, and topics where it is principally

Abstract = {{The use of Robotics as a teaching tool to foster knowledge in Science,
   Technology, Engineering and Mathematics - STEM for high school students
   is growing. Within this context, the need for solutions that decreases
   the overall cost of hardware is mandatory. In this work, a 25 euros
   Android-based mobile robot that allows connecting a smartphone to
   different robot ``bodies{''} (each composed by different hardware:
   Arduino, LEGO, etc.) is proposed, targeting mainly high school students.
   The mobile platform was built using 3D printed parts and uses an Arduino
   board to control the servos used for the locomotion. To communicate with
   the Android application, a Bluetooth module is also used. The Android
   application takes advantage of the smartphone camera and has some
   pre-implemented image processing modules, allowing actions such as
   coloured line following, colour proximity detection and coloured object
   tracking. Another import feature present in the Android application is
   its coding capability, thanks to an embedded code interpreter. This
   feature was implemented using BeanShell, a lightweight script
   interpreter for Java. It allows writing scripts in Java programming
   language, which are then executed by the robot. This interpreter also
   provides a way for the user to write a set of instructions that defines
   the behaviour of the robot, primarily by checking the current status of
   the sensors and the smartphone camera, and manipulating the velocity of
   the motors.
   All of the necessary components (3D source CAD + STLs) of the mobile
   platform presented here are available online, enabling the recreation of
   a replica of the robot body. A detailed list of electronic components
   and its connections are also provided, as well as the Arduino source
   code along with the installation file needed for the Android
   application. All the necessary information can be accessed at:
   https://github.com/ee09115/squirlrob.
   The high school students are then challenged to solve classical robotics
   tasks like line following, obstacle avoidance, and using the virtual
   sensors to create new challenges.
   By providing this set of tools (Android app, source code, 3D CAD models,
   documentation), a promotion of knowledge is expected, thus developing
   enthusiast students in robotics multidisciplinary fields, such as
   mechanical designing, electronics designing, mathematics, coding, etc.
   (in short, all the relevant STEM areas).
   Finally, a general analysis of the usability, interoperability and
   feature extension capacity is made, always taking into consideration the
   educational purposes of this work.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents the design, modeling, and implementation of a neural
   network inverse model controller for tracking the maximum power point of
   a photovoltaic (PV) module. A nonlinear autoregressive network with
   exogenous inputs (NARX) was implemented in a serial-parallel
   architecture. The PV module mathematical modeling was developed, a buck
   converter was designed to operate in the continuous conduction mode with
   a switching frequency of 20 KHz, and the dynamic neural controller was
   designed using the Neural Network Toolbox from Matlab/Simulink
   (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA), and it was implemented on an open-hardware
   Arduino Mega board. To obtain the reference signals for the NARX and
   determine the 65 W PV module behavior, a system made of a 0.8 W PV cell,
   a temperature sensor, a voltage sensor and a static neural network, was
   used. To evaluate performance a comparison with the P\&O traditional
   algorithm was done in terms of response time and oscillations around the
   operating point. Simulation results demonstrated the superiority of
   neural controller over the P\&O. Implementation results showed that
   approximately the same power is obtained with both controllers, but the
   P\&O controller presents oscillations between 7 W and 10 W, in contrast
   to the inverse controller, which had oscillations between 1 W and 2 W.}},

Abstract = {{Modern ultrasonic phased-array controllers are electronic systems
   capable of delaying the transmitted or received signals of multiple
   transducers. Configurable transmit-receive array systems, capable of
   electronic steering and shaping of the beam in near real-time, are
   available commercially, for example, for medical imaging. However,
   emerging applications, such as ultrasonic haptics, parametric audio, or
   ultrasonic levitation, require only a small subset of the capabilities
   provided by the existing controllers. To meet this need, we present
   Ultraino, a modular, inexpensive, and open platform that provides
   hardware, software, and example applications specifically aimed at
   controlling the transmission of narrowband airborne ultrasound. Our
   system is composed of software, driver boards, and arrays that enable
   users to quickly and efficiently perform research in various emerging
   applications. The software can be used to define array geometries,
   simulate the acoustic field in real time, and control the connected
   driver boards. The driver board design is based on an Arduino Mega and
   can control 64 channels with a square wave of up to 17 Vpp and pi/5
   phase resolution. Multiple boards can be chained together to increase
   the number of channels. The 40-kHz arrays with flat and spherical
   geometries are demonstrated for parametric audio generation, acoustic
   levitation, and haptic feedback.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most critical parameters in agricultural production is
   environmental conditions. It is of vital importance to ensure and
   monitor suitable climatic conditions for various controlled agricultural
   structures and production systems such as greenhouses. To this aim, most
   data monitoring systems cannot be efficiently used due to high cost and
   insufficient technical knowledge. It is possible to design low-cost and
   scalable monitoring, control and data acquisition systems via open
   source hardware in order to monitor climatic data for agricultural
   practices in small enterprises and rural areas. In this study, a low
   cost system designed via open source hardware was tested under real
   conditions. Temperature and relative humidity were measured via the
   sensors in the system and sent to a data server through a wireless
   network. In addition, collected data was compared to reference devices
   for statistical analysis. The results suggest that these low-cost
   systems, which are designed via open source hardware, can be used as a
   data collection and decision support, system by agricultural
   enterprises.}},

Abstract = {{The need for fabricating a prototype circuit arises frequently in
   electronics, including education and research laboratories. In
   resource-poor countries in the developing world, this is hindered by the
   high cost of commercial Printed Circuit Board (PCB) prototyping machines
   and long turn-around commercial fabrication process. Practical, hands-on
   laboratory teaching and experimentation is necessary to improve learning
   in electronics. In this paper, a low-cost build-your-own (BYO)
   semi-automated three-axis PCB milling machine for double-sided PCB
   prototyping is developed using commercial components and open source
   hardware and free open source software, to provide students, teachers,
   and engineers an accessible and affordable resource for PCB prototyping.
   Also, the main problems encountered during fabrication of PCB have been
   mentioned and the techniques used to solve them are discussed in detail.

Abstract = {{Water removal is an essential step during crude oil production due to
   several problems such as increased transportation costs and high
   corrosion rate due to dissolved salts. Indirect low frequency ultrasonic
   energy (US), using baths, has been recently proposed as an effective
   alternative for crude oil demulsification. However, the reactor position
   during sonication and its influence on the demulsification efficiency
   for crude oil has not been evaluated. In this sense, the aim of this
   study was to develop an automated system based on an open source
   hardware for mapping the acoustic field distribution in an US bath
   operating at 35 kHz using a hydrophone. Data acquired with this system
   provided information to evaluate the demulsification efficiency in the
   different positions of the US bath and correlate it with the acoustic
   intensity distribution. The automated 3D-mapping system revealed a
   higher acoustic intensity in the regions immediately above the
   transducers (ca. 0.6 W cm(-2)), while the other regions presented a
   relatively lower intensity (ca. 0.1 W cm(-2)). Experimental data
   demonstrated that reactors positioned in the most intense acoustic
   regions provided a much higher efficiency of demulsificadon in
   comparison with the ones positioned in the less intense acoustic field
   regions. Demulsification efficiency up to 93\% was obtained with 15 min
   of sonication (100\% amplitude) using few amount of chemical
   demulsifier. Hence, this work demonstrated that the information acquired
   with the developed mapping system could be used for inducing a higher
   efficiency of demulsification only by finding the more suitable position
   of reactor in the US bath, which certainly will help development of
   appropriate reactors design when looking for such approach.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Vertical jump tests are used to assess lower-limb power of
   athletes in sport sciences. Flight time measurement with jump-mat
   systems is the most common procedure for this purpose. The aim of this
   study was to analyze the concurrent validity and reliability of two
   proprietary systems (Globus and Axon) and an open-source system
   (Chronojump). Methods: A conditioning electric circuit governed by a
   controlled wave generator is designed to substitute athletes jumping on
   a physical mat. In order to look for possible differences associated to
   timekeeping by each microcontroller device, all three systems are fed by
   the circuit simultaneously. Results: Concurrent validity was high for
   the three systems. Standarized typical error of estimate (TEE) was
   trivial, according to MBI interpretation as well as perfect Pearson
   correlation coefficient. Reliability was assessed based on the
   coefficient of variation of flight time measure, resulting in
   0.17-0.63\% (0.05-0.12 cm) for Globus, 0.01\% (0.09 cm) for Chronojump
   and 5.65-9.38\% (2.15-3.53 cm) for Axon. These results show that all
   jump-mat system produced nearly identical measures of flight time so
   they can be considered valid and reliable for practical purposes. In
   comparison, Chronojump showed the best performance whereas Axon showed
   enough variability and disagreement to pose a problem in testing elite
   athletes. Conclusions: These experiments show that open-source jump mats
   are as valid and reliable as their proprietary counterparts at a lower
   cost. Therefore, practitioners can be confident in using Globus or
   Chronojump systems to test athletes' jump height because of their
   negligible errors and Axon system to monitor general population.}},

Abstract = {{Some countries in South America such as Ecuador, Colombia and Peru have
   increased their presence in the production and export of orchids.
   Ecuador has 14\% of the world's species and in 2014 its orchid exports
   increased 8\%, this shows the importance of this product for the
   country. An orchid greenhouse is a botanical garden specialized in the
   cultivation, preservation and exhibition of orchids, these places
   require that physical variables such as ambient temperature, humidity
   and illuminance to be continuously monitored and controlled for the
   proper growth of orchids. The present work proposes the design,
   prototyping and deployment of a wireless sensor network for the
   monitoring of physical variables in the Municipal orchid greenhouse of
   Loja, based on open hardware technology. As a result, two prototypes
   were implemented: one from the variable monitoring node and the other
   from the central node for visualization and recording of variables. For
   the validation of the prototypes, performance tests were carried out in
   the field. Approximately 3000 samples were obtained with a 100\%
   reliability rate in the transit of the data within the process of
   acquisition, transmission, reception and storage.}},

Abstract = {{The pumping system of the Administration Board of Drinking Water and
   Sanitation of the Algarrobera (JAAPS-LA) is made up of a cylindrical
   aquifer with dimensions of 70 meters deep and 0.305 meters in diameter,
   the central element of this system is the submersible pump electrical,
   which is controlled by time. This current system has some deficiencies,
   among them the shortage of drinking water when the demand of the users
   is higher than the nominal one; and the large waste of potable water
   when the demand is lower than the nominal one. The present work proposes
   the design, implementation and integration of a monitoring and
   automation system applied to the JAAPS-LA pumping system, based on a
   wireless sensor network, open hardware and a PLC. As a result, all the
   modules of the system were implemented: the liquid level acquisition
   module in the distribution tank by means of liquid level sensors; the
   wireless data transmission and reception module; the drive module of the
   pump by means of the Programmable logic controller (PLC); and, finally,
   the solar-photovoltaic energy capture module. To evaluate the
   performance of the monitoring and automation system implemented, the
   behavior was monitored for 4 days, with the data obtained it was
   possible to verify the correct pump drive logic and the high efficiency
   (100\%) of the communication system.}},

Abstract = {{It is suggested to improve the level of security by applying the open
   source paradigm to the entire IT supply chain and by subjecting the
   resulting components to verification when required. This would lead to a
   new trajectory for IT product development which could even increase the
   efficiency of addressing novel types of hardware-oriented attacks or
   employing stealthy hardware features. This could require increased
   transparency of semiconductor fabs. For designing open hardware several
   nuclei already exist. The proposed path would hold particular promise
   for security-critical components, which could be specified in such a way
   as to precisely match hardware characteristics. As some components would
   continue to be built using existing components for some time, a
   generalized a priori statement about the security of the complete supply
   chain, such as ``verified{''} or ``proven{''}, will initially be
   impossible.}},

Abstract = {{The inclusion of pupils with special educational needs (SEN) in
   classrooms is a reality for many teachers. These professionals have a
   favourable attitude towards the inclusion of pupils with SEN in the
   regular teaching classrooms.
   An inclusive education system should be ``structured and developed
   taking into account the diversity of characteristics of young children,
   different needs or problems{''} and for these reasons to differentiate
   measures.
   Special education is aimed at educational and social inclusion,
   educational access and success, autonomy, emotional stability, as well
   as the promotion of equal opportunities, preparation for continuing
   education or adequate preparation for the professional life and for a
   transition from school to employment of children and young people with
   permanent special educational needs{''}.
   A particular case of SEN is that of people with autism, and they
   characterize autism as ``a rare and serious psychiatric illness in
   childhood and characterized by imbalanced intellectual development that
   affects the ability to socialize.{''} It is also reported in the
   literature that these people, with autism, have great difficulties in
   communicating verbal and nonverbal, while having a great difficulty in
   interpreting language.
   Technology-based learning, in particular through the use of visual and
   multimedia environments, is a facilitating tool for people with autism
   spectrum disorders to learn best when information is presented visually.
   This view is also shared by several authors when refer that to
   facilitate ``inclusion and children / young people with SEN in today's
   society, Information and Communication Technologies play a fundamental
   role, as they facilitate a differentiated, active and collaborative
   intervention of all stakeholders in the life of each of these
   people{''}.
   This document reports on an activity project that can be used by
   Educators of students with autism. Two tools are used, Makey-Makey
   hardware and Scratch software. The use of open-hardware
   microcontrollers, with no need for programming and free software, allows
   this project to be shared and reconverted to other topics. This work
   arose from a challenge of proposing an activity to be used by children
   with special educational needs using ICT. In a first step the
   bibliography related to the use of ICT in the classroom with these
   children and the legislation that served to obtain the first
   orientations was consulted. Then a specialist was consulted and then the
   prototype of the project was built, succinct enough that it could be
   replicated and perceived by these Educators.}},

Abstract = {{The Army continues the development of 3D printing technology to enhance
   the capability to produce smaller and lighter precision weaponry.
   Researchers and support organizations that are affiliated with the Army
   Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center
   (AMRDEC) are developing nano based structures and components for
   advanced weaponry, aviation, and autonomous air/ground systems
   applications. The first key area consists of determining in-plane and
   out-of-plane shear properties of test articles made by 3D printing
   (Fused Deposition Modeling - FDM) and comparing to the conventional
   extrusion/forming sheet process. Test specimens are made from three
   polymer materials: acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), high impact
   poly-styrene (HIPS), and poly-lactic acid (PLA). Laboratory testing is
   performed according to the ASTM D3846-02 method for determining the
   in-plane shear strength, while the ASTM D5379 method is used for
   determining the out-of-plane shear properties. A description on how the
   3D printing process advances the shear properties and has the potential
   of improving the in-plane and cross-sectional shear properties over the
   conventional manufacturing process is presented. The second key area
   demonstrates a set of materials, processes, and techniques that support
   the enabling of additive manufacture (AM) of RF components. Research
   activities are focused on developing open-source hardware/software
   multi-material direct digital printing, and producing 3D printed
   antenna, passive components, and connectors for C-band and Ku-band
   systems. Material studies have demonstrated a suitable material set for
   RF components and identified key material performance limits. Results
   show how more enhancement could be achieved by optimizing the variables
   that affect 3D printing.}},

Abstract = {{Because of the great popularity of the maker movement, the concept of
   ``Do it yourself{''} (DIY) has gained considerable public attention.
   Furthermore, because of the development of rapid prototyping, the rise
   of open-source hardware and programming languages, the popularization of
   network communities, and the establishment of maker spaces, DIY has been
   taken to the next level: ``co-creation.{''} This concept requires reform
   to the standard curriculum in information and technology education.
   Therefore, this study aims to define the key competences of makers to
   construct the competence indicators of Maker Education for information
   and technology education in elementary school. On this basis, a
   curriculum can be developed, and an evaluation system for learning
   effectiveness can be built to equip students with the abilities to adapt
   to life and tackle challenges. In this study, the Fuzzy Delphi Method
   (FDM) was applied to collect and analyze data in the form of a
   questionnaire survey. The subjects were 12 experts from enterprises,
   governmental institutions, schools and research institutes. The research
   achievements include 3 factors ({''}Theoretical knowledge,{''}
   ``Practical application,{''} ``Maker's mindset{''}), and 10 indicators.}},

Abstract = {{The usage of real-time tracking systems for vehicles has demonstrated to
   be a viable and economical option, entailing in more control and
   management of the fleet, plus the reduction of the logistics costs of
   companies using them. Since 2006 in Cuba, there is a fleet control and
   management system employed by almost all the companies, which hire a
   variant of the service in a differed manner; i.e., the data are not
   processed in real-time. In this research paper, we propose the design of
   a device based only on open source hardware/software components allowing
   the real-time vehicle tracking. Our proposal is suitable for the
   conditions of the country where it was developed (Cuba), presenting high
   functionality than other proposals. For the design, we employed an
   Arduino UNO controller board, an Adafruit FONA808 GPS/GSM module, and
   other accessories. As per the performed experiments, the proposed
   hardware/software architecture complies with the operation,
   configuration, and security requirements to achieve a viable product

   the Department of Information Management, expects to develop a
   systematic information Maker curriculum. This curriculum, combined with
   the 3D printing machine and Arduino open hardware configured with the
   STEM education framework, is designed to explore the impact of the
   introduction of Maker education to information curriculum of technical
   or vocational colleges on attitude differences and learning of STEM. Two
   courses, 3D model design and Arduino programming, are implemented, after
   the end of which, students' achievements are evaluated. The result is
   that male still have higher interests in science, engineering and
   technology than women, but Maker curriculum is multifaceted and
   foundational so that many people can spend a little time in learning and
   use various skills to produce their own works. Therefore, there is
   little difference between women and men in scores of achievement test.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a cost-effective implementation method of a
   ball and plate system as an educational kit and present the application
   of sliding mode control to achieve better control performance. We choose
   a Stewart platform with rotary actuators to manipulate the plate. We
   explain the construction method of the platform in detail. We use a
   touch panel as a sensor to obtain the positional data at a high sample
   rate and to make the system compact. As a main control unit, we use a
   Nucleo-32 board, which is a small and powerful open source hardware with
   a built-in floating point unit. For controller synthesis, we show a
   mathematical model of the ball and plate system and explain the
   kinematics analysis of the Stewart platform. We design a sliding mode
   controller that includes error integration, which makes the system
   robust against external disturbances. We describe the results of the
   simulations and the experiments and then illustrate the advantage of the
   applied sliding mode control compared to LQ control. The proposed system
   is cost-effective, can be easily built, has good control performance,
   and occupies a small space. For these reasons, we expect that the system
   can be efficiently used as an educational tool.}},

Abstract = {{In 2013 the Competition for Authenticated Encryption: Security,
   Applicability, and Robustness (CAESAR) was started. It aims at
   determining a portfolio of ciphers for authenticated encryption that has
   advantages over AES-GCM in terms of performance, security, and ease of
   implementation. This competition, for the first time, provides a
   standardized hardware API, which allows a fair comparison of hardware
   implementations. However, the community still lacks a common platform to
   automatically test hardware implementations, confirm implementation
   claims, and benchmark performance figures on real hardware in terms of
   runtime, area, power and energy consumption. In this work, we present a
   common platform using the CAESAR-API in a Xilinx Zynq-7000 System on
   Chip (SoC) with ARM processors and an AXI interface. This reflects a
   typical real world usage scenario for hardware-accelerators and thus
   extends the work for a fair comparison of hardware implementations in
   three dimensions: first the API is evaluated on a real SoC, which shows,
   e.g. the performance of the API. Second, it provides a hardware platform
   to test the proposed implementations of the candidates easily. This can
   be used by future designers, as we will provide it as open source
   hardware. Finally, we ran all published hardware implementations of the
   current 3rd-round candidates during which we identified several
   implementation weaknesses, e.g. presumably unintended latches in the
   design, hence emphasizing the importance of testing hardware proposals
   on real hardware.}},

   and real-robot modes, enabling smooth transition from a virtual robot
   manipulator to a real one. We describe the main aspects of our platform
   that ensure low production costs and encourage openness of both its
   hardware and software. The main goal of our work was to create a viable
   low-cost robotic manipulator platform alternative for the university
   level courses in intelligent robotics, however, the application domain
   is very broad.}},

Abstract = {{There has been growing popularity in do-ityourself (DIY) electronics for
   wearable computing and human-machine interaction. This has introduced
   exciting opportunities to promote science, technology, engineering, art,
   and mathematics (STEAM) education that highlights the intersection of
   electronics, materials, and artistic expression. Here, we present a
   systematic guide to a low-cost (<\$10 per student) outreach workshop on
   wearable electronics for middle school students (and potentially high
   school students with minor modifications) that is complementary to
   existing STEM outreach programs. In this workshop, students use basic
   craft skills to fabricate a wearable human-computer interface out of
   commercially available materials. The device is interfaced with a
   computer via open source hardware and software, using the universal
   serial bus (USB) human interface device (HID) protocol. The workshop
   exposes students to wearable technologies, a rapidly growing and
   exciting sub-domain of the electronics industry, and provides a fun and
   engaging hands-on activity that draws connections between fashion,
   technology, and personal electronics.}},

   Based on Deep Learning}},

Volume = {{6}},
Pages = {{17880-17886}},
Abstract = {{Highly developed drone technology enables the use of drones in a wide
   variety of areas. However, those drones are mainly used in the unmanned
   aerial vehicles. We believe that underwater drones will become a big
   research topic and find a market in the near future. We developed an
   underwater drone with a 360 degrees panoramic camera acting as the
   ``eye{''} of the drone. The designs are based on the open-source
   hardware and will be shared as an open-source for contributing to the
   innovation of manufacturing including drone. The function of the 360
   degrees panoramic camera is generated by correcting the images taken by
   two fisheye lenses. The underwater drone was designed by extending the
   Raspberry Pi compute module, the frame was designed by OpenSCAD, and the
   printed circuit board was designed by MakePro. As for the application of
   the underwater drone, we focused on fish recognition for investigating
   fish species in a natural lake to help protect the original environment.
   Fish recognition is based on deep learning, which is the biggest topic
   in the artificial intelligence research field today. Experimental
   results show that the function of the underwater drone achieved at
   diving in the leak automatically. The 360 degrees panoramic images were
   generated correctly. Fish recognition achieved 87\% accuracy by deep
   learning.}},

Abstract = {{Earthquake effects are strongly related with the properties of the local
   geology, amplifying the ground motion, especially in soft soils. This
   amplification is connected with the resonant frequency, which can be
   estimated applying the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (1-1/V)
   method on seismic noise measurements. In this work, a low-cost
   user-friendly data acquisition system (Geophonino-3D) has been designed
   for three-component seismic noise recording. The developed system
   consists of the signal conditioning circuit and the Arduino Due with an
   SD Shield for data storage. The suitability of the equipment for the
   application of the H/V method has been first assessed in the laboratory,
   according to the experimental sensitivity, the internal noise stability
   and the channel consistency. Subsequently, experimental verification has
   been carried out by recording seismic noise at eight different sites
   along the province of Alicante (southeast Spain), with different soil
   characteristics. The performance of the developed acquisition system has
   been evaluated in terms of the power spectral density and the H/V peaks
   by comparison with the results obtained through a commercial seismic
   recorder. The obtained results show the applicability of the developed
   acquisition system to record seismic noise and to apply the H/V method.
   Geophonino-3D is an open source and open hardware system and the price
   of its components is much lower than any other commercial equipment,
   which becomes a significant advance especially for small research groups
   with reduced economic support. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Medlay: A Reconfigurable Micro-Power Management to Investigate
   Self-Powered Systems}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In self-powered microsystems, a power management is essential to
   extract, transfer and regulate power from energy harvesting sources to
   loads such as sensors. The challenge is to consider all of the different
   structures and components available and build the optimal power
   management on a microscale. The purpose of this paper is to streamline
   the design process by creating a novel reconfigurable testbed called
   Medlay. First, we propose a uniform interface for management functions
   e.g., power conversion, energy storing and power routing. This interface
   results in a clear layout because power and status pins are strictly
   separated, and inputs and outputs have fixed positions. Medlay is the
   ready-to-use and open-hardware platform based on the interface. It
   consists of a base board and small modules incorporating e.g., dc-dc
   converters, power switches and supercapacitors. Measurements confirm
   that Medlay represents a system on one circuit board, as parasitic
   effects of the interconnections are negligible. The versatility
   regarding different setups on the testbed is determined to over 250,000
   combinations by layout graph grammar. Lastly, we underline the
   applicability by recreating three state-of-the-art systems with the
   testbed. In conclusion, Medlay facilitates building and testing power
   management in a very compact, clear and extensible fashion.}},

Abstract = {{After a long-term debate and almost two years of legislative work, the
   Revenue Registry Act was adopted in the Czech Republic. The first and
   main reason for introducing the revenue registry was the lack of
   instruments of the Tax Administration to fight tax evasions. The second
   reason was the elimination of unfair competition based on gain of undue
   advantage by not paying the value added tax (VAT) and the income tax.
   The system of the revenue registry in the Czech Republic is founded on
   several principles that distinguish it from other systems based on a
   cash register or other systems of electronic evidence. The revenue
   registry is based on the principles of electronisation, on-line access
   of tax administrator to information, the possibility of voluntary public
   involvement into oversight and open hardware and software solution.
   Unfortunately, shortly after the adoption by the Parliament, the group
   of legislators started a case at the Constitutional Court, demanding the
   abolition of the Revenue Registry Act or at least some parts of the Act
   because of its unconstitutionality. They were partially successful and
   now the Ministry of Finance has been tasked with the preparation of an
   amendment to the Act. The goal of this contribution is to briefly
   introduce and describe the Revenue Registry Act, critically analyse the
   fundamental provisions of the Act, summarize pros and cons of the
   regulation, critically analyse the decision of the Constitutional Court
   and introduce the Ministry's proposal of amendments. The hypothesis that
   the electronic revenue registry is an effective tool for fair tax
   payments was neither confirmed nor disproved: The electronic revenue
   registry might be an effective tool for fair tax payments, but only in
   case of unified rules for all businessmen. The higher the number of
   exemptions is, the less effective tool the revenue registry is.}},

Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{Excluding the ion source, an ion mobility spectrometer is fundamentally
   comprised of drift chamber, ion gate, pulsing electronics, and a
   mechanism for amplifying and recording ion signals. Historically, the
   solutions to each of these challenges have been custom and rarely
   replicated exactly. For the IMS research community few detailed
   resources exist that explicitly detail the construction and operation of
   ion mobility systems. In an effort to address this knowledge gap we
   outline a solution to one of the key aspects of a drift tube ion
   mobility system, the ion gate pulser. Bradbury-Nielsen or Tyndall ion
   gates are found in nearly every research-grade and commercial IMS
   system. While conceptually simple, these gate structures often require
   custom, high-voltage, floating electronics. In this report we detail the
   operation and performance characteristics of a wifi-enabled,
   MOSFET-based pulser design that uses a lithium-polymer battery and does
   not require high voltage isolation transformers. Currently, each output
   of this circuit follows a TTL signal with similar to 20 ns rise and fall
   times, pulses up to +/- 200 V, and is entirely isolated using fiber
   optics. Detailed schematics and source code are provided to enable
   continued use of robust pulsing electronics that ease experimental
   efforts for future comparison.}},

Abstract = {{The advent of easy-to-use open source microcontrollers, off-the-shelf
   electronics and customizable manufacturing technologies has facilitated
   the development of inexpensive scientific devices and laboratory
   equipment. In this study, we describe an imaging system that integrates
   low-cost and open-source hardware, software and genetic resources. The
   multi-fluorescence imaging system consists of readily available 470 nm
   LEDs, a Raspberry Pi camera and a set of filters made with low cost
   acrylics. This device allows imaging in scales ranging from single
   colonies to entire plates. We developed a set of genetic components
   (e.g. promoters, coding sequences, terminators) and vectors following
   the standard framework of Golden Gate, which allowed the fabrication of
   genetic constructs in a combinatorial, low cost and robust manner. In
   order to provide simultaneous imaging of multiple wavelength signals, we
   screened a series of long stokes shift fluorescent proteins that could
   be combined with cyan/green fluorescent proteins. We found CyOFP1,
   mBeRFP and sfGFP to be the most compatible set for 3-channel fluorescent
   imaging. We developed open source Python code to operate the hardware to
   run time-lapse experiments with automated control of illumination and
   camera and a Python module to analyze data and extract meaningful
   biological information. To demonstrate the potential application of this
   integral system, we tested its performance on a diverse range of imaging
   assays often used in disciplines such as microbial ecology, microbiology
   and synthetic biology. We also assessed its potential use in a high
   school environment to teach biology, hardware design, optics, and
   programming. Together, these results demonstrate the successful
   integration of open source hardware, software, genetic resources and
   customizable manufacturing to obtain a powerful, low cost and robust
   system for education, scientific research and bioengineering. All the
   resources developed here are available under open source licenses.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes a complete characterization system for
   photovoltaic devices designed to acquire the current-voltage curve and
   to process the obtained data. The proposed system can be replicated for

   commonly available in any laboratory, the accuracy of measurements is
   ensured. A capacitive load is used to bias the device due to its
   versatility and simplicity. The system includes a common part and an
   interchangeable part that must be designed depending on the electrical
   characteristics of each PV device. Control software, developed in
   LabVIEW, controls the equipment, performs automatic campaigns of
   measurements, and performs additional calculations in real time. These
   include different procedures to extrapolate the measurements to standard
   test conditions and methods to obtain the intrinsic parameters of the
   single diode model. A deep analysis of the uncertainty of measurement is
   also provided. Finally, the proposed system is validated by comparing
   the results obtained from some commercial photovoltaic modules to the

Abstract = {{The race to achieve smart cities is producing a continuous effort to
   adapt new developments and knowledge, for administrations and citizens.
   Information and Communications Technology are called on to be one of the
   key players to get these cities to use smart devices and sensors
   (Internet of Things) to know at every moment what is happening within
   the city, in order to make decisions that will improve the management of
   resources.
   The proliferation of these ``smart things{''} is producing significant
   deployment of networks in the city context. Most of these devices are
   proprietary solutions, which do not offer free access to the data they
   provide. Therefore, this prevents the interoperability and compatibility
   of these solutions in the current smart city developments.
   This paper presents how to embed an open sensorized platform for both
   hardware and software in the context of a smart city, more specifically
   in a university campus. For this integration, GlScience comes into play,
   where it offers different open standards that allow full control over
   ``smart things{''} as an agile and interoperable way to achieve this. To
   test our system, we have deployed a network of different sensorized
   platforms inside the university campus, in order to monitor
   environmental phenomena. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   a control law that is based on the feedback linearization method and
   enhanced by an adaptive fuzzy algorithm to cope with modeling
   inaccuracies. The proposed depth controller is computationally light
   enough to run on ADAs embedded hardware. In experiments performed in a
   wave tank, the adaptive fuzzy scheme shows the ability to deal with both
   depth regulation and depth profile tracking. ADA is even able to hold on
   to dynamic isobars despite external disturbances. We demonstrate that
   under the influence of waves, ADA describes orbital motions similar to
   water particles.}},

Title = {{A force and thermal sensing skin for robots in human environments}},
Journal = {{ROBOTICS AND AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{1-14}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Working together, heated and unheated temperature sensors can recognize
   contact with different materials and contact with the human body. As
   such, distributing these sensors across a robot's body could be
   beneficial for operation in human environments. We present a stretchable
   fabric-based skin with force and thermal sensors that is suitable for
   covering areas of a robot's body, including curved surfaces. It also
   adds a layer of compliance that conforms to manipulated objects,
   improving thermal sensing. Our open hardware design addresses thermal
   sensing challenges, such as the time to heat the sensors, the efficiency
   of sensing, and the distribution of sensors across the skin. It
   incorporates small self-heated temperature sensors on the surface of the
   skin that directly make contact with objects, improving the sensors'
   response times. Our approach seeks to fully cover the robot's body with
   large force sensors, but treats temperature sensors as small, point-like
   sensors sparsely distributed across the skin. We present a mathematical
   model to help predict how many of these point-like temperature sensors
   should be used in order to increase the likelihood of them making
   contact with an object. To evaluate our design, we conducted tests in
   which a robot arm used a cylindrical end effector covered with skin to
   slide objects and press on objects made from four different materials.
   After assessing the safety of our design, we also had the robot make
   contact with the forearms and clothed shoulders of 10 human
   participants. With 2.0 s of contact, the actively-heated temperature
   sensors enabled binary classification accuracy over 90\% for the
   majority of material pairs. The system could more rapidly distinguish
   between materials with large differences in their thermal effusivities
   (e.g., 90\% accuracy for pine wood vs. aluminum with 0.5 s of contact).
   For discrimination between humans vs. the four materials, the skin's
   force and thermal sensing modalities achieved 93\% classification
   accuracy with 0.5 s of contact. Overall, our results suggest that our
   skin design could enable robots to recognize contact with distinct
   task-relevant materials and humans while performing manipulation tasks
   in human environments. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Open Source 3-D Printed Nutating Mixer}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{As the open source development of additive manufacturing has led to
   low-cost desktop three-dimensional (3-D) printing, a number of
   scientists throughout the world have begun to share digital designs of
   free and open source scientific hardware. Open source scientific
   hardware enables custom experimentation, laboratory control, rapid
   upgrading, transparent maintenance, and lower costs in general. To aid
   in this trend, this study describes the development, design, assembly,
   and operation of a 3-D printable open source desktop nutating mixer,
   which provides a fixed 20 degrees platform tilt angle for a gentle
   three-dimensional (gyrating) agitation of chemical or biological samples
   (e.g., DNA or blood samples) without foam formation. The custom
   components for the nutating mixer are designed using open source FreeCAD
   software to enable customization. All of the non-readily available
   components can be fabricated with a low-cost RepRap 3-D printer using an
   open source software tool chain from common thermoplastics. All of the
   designs are open sourced and can be configured to add more functionality
   to the equipment in the future. It is relatively easy to assemble and is
   accessible to both the science education of younger students as well as
   state-of-the-art research laboratories. Overall, the open source
   nutating mixer can be fabricated with US\$37 in parts, which is 1/10th
   of the cost of proprietary nutating mixers with similar capabilities.
   The open source nature of the device allow it to be easily repaired or
   upgraded with digital files, as well as to accommodate custom sample
   sizes and mixing velocities with minimal additional costs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a data acquisition unit which synchronously samples
   multiple channels in a manner such that the time of day at which each
   sample is taken is known. This allows measurements taken at multiple
   locations to be compared with confidence. The intended application is
   wide area electrical power system measurements, in particular phasor
   measurement units (PMUs). The novelty of the authors' design is the
   application of an open hardware development platform to discipline a
   commodity analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to a broadcast time signal,
   usually but not exclusively GPS. The methodology used creates a driver
   layer for the ADC to achieve real-time sampling in a nonpreemptive Linux
   environment. The use of open hardware and software addresses the need
   for a transparent instrument for use in research and development of PMU
   technology. Through a choice of either a software or hardware
   phase-locked loop, the ADC is controlled to acquire exactly 256 samples
   per nominal power system cycle (i. e., 50/60 Hz), precisely time
   synchronized to GPS, at 16-b resolution and 94.2-dB SNR. The design of a
   printed circuit board expansion board featuring all necessary components
   is provided. The performance of the system is evaluated.
   Interoperability and data exchange with other systems is achieved by use
   of open schemas and communication protocols. This allows rapid
   integration with popular numerical simulation environments.}},

Abstract = {{In the era of the forth Industrial Revolution, open source code and open
   source hardware have gained much attention. In particular, 3D printing
   technology is expanding into the realms of classical science, technology
   and our daily lives. Relatedly, in the present study, we demonstrate the
   manufacture of a nano-LC MALDI spotter robot using 3D printing
   technology. The parts of the spotter robot were either made using a 3D
   printer or purchased as 3D printer parts from the 3D printer online
   market, so that anyone can make the robot without a deep knowledge of
   engineering or electronics, i.e., DIY (do-it-yourself) product. In the
   nano-LC MALDI spotter, the nano-LC eluent and MALDI matrix were mixed in
   a T-union and discharged from the capillary outlet. The eluent and
   matrix mixture could be spotted onto the movable MALDI plate. The MALDI
   plate was designed to translate in a two-dimensional space (xy plane),
   which was enabled by the movements of two stepper motors. In the paper,
   all computer-aided design (CAD) files for the parts and operation
   software are provided to help the reader manufacture their own spotter

Abstract = {{Objective. Closed-loop experiments, in which causal interventions are
   conditioned on the state of the system under investigation, have become
   increasingly common in neuroscience. Such experiments can have a high
   degree of explanatory power, but they require a precise implementation
   that can be difficult to replicate across laboratories. We sought to
   overcome this limitation by building open-source software that makes it
   easier to develop and share algorithms for closed-loop control.
   Approach. We created the Open Ephys GUI, an opensource platform for
   multichannel electrophysiology experiments. In addition to the standard
   `open-loop' visualization and recording functionality, the GUI also
   includes modules for delivering feedback in response to events detected
   in the incoming data stream. Importantly, these modules can be built and
   shared as plugins, which makes it possible for users to extend the
   functionality of the GUI through a simple API, without having to
   understand the inner workings of the entire application. Main results.
   In combination with low-cost, open-source hardware for amplifying and
   digitizing neural signals, the GUI has been used for closedloop
   experiments that perturb the hippocampal theta rhythm in a
   phase-specific manner. Significance. The Open Ephys GUI is the first
   widely used application for multichannel electrophysiology that
   leverages a plugin-based workflow. We hope that it will lower the
   barrier to entry for electrophysiologists who wish to incorporate
   real-time feedback into their research.}},

Abstract = {{We describe the implementation of an OPT plate to perform optical
   projection tomography (OPT) on a commercial wide-field inverted
   microscope, using our open-source hardware and software. The OPT plate
   includes a tilt adjustment for alignment and a stepper motor for sample
   rotation as required by standard projection tomography. Depending on
   magnification requirements, three methods of performing OPT are detailed
   using this adaptor plate: a conventional direct OPT method requiring
   only the addition of a limiting aperture behind the objective lens; an
   external optical-relay method allowing conventional OPT to be performed
   at magnifications >4x; a remote focal scanning and region-of-interest
   method for improved spatial resolution OPT (up to similar to 1.6 mu m).
   All three methods use the microscope's existing incoherent light source
   (i.e. arc-lamp) and all of its inherent functionality is maintained for
   day-to-day use. OPT acquisitions are performed on in vivo zebrafish
   embryos to demonstrate the implementations' viability.}},

Abstract = {{Since 2001, the departments of Electrical and Electronics and
   Information and Communication Electronics Engineering of Faculty of
   Engineering, the University of Tokyo (UTokyo) have jointly given a
   lecture on autonomous electronic information devices for undergraduate
   students. According to the on-line questionnaire, 80\% of students in
   2010-2012 replied that the lecture was useful for their future career.
   The task given to students was to design and realise an autonomous
   electronic information devices (so-called the IoT-gadgets') by
   themselves, and conduct a live demonstration in front of their
   colleagues. The device must have an input', output', and some
   information processing'. Being aware of the speed of technology
   evolution as well as the short hours of the lecture, the professor tried
   not to give direct answers to students' questions on how-to instantly
   build and program an information device. Instead, the students were told
   to beware of their methods'. This refers to the deductive thinking
   introduced by Rene Descartes, and in the lecture's context how students
   should behave in order to realise the device. In this study, the
   backgrounds of various associated topics are discussed, such as the
   UTokyo's educational system, the world's rapid prototyping movement,
   open hardware, course design, students' reactions, and future
   directions.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 16}},
Abstract = {{In the past decades, bioassays and whole-organism bioassay have become
   important tools not only in compliance testing of industrial chemicals
   and plant protection products, but also in the monitoring of
   environmental quality. With few exceptions, such test systems are
   discontinuous. They require exposure of the biological test material in
   small units, such as multiwell plates, during prolonged incubation
   periods, and do not allow online read-outs. It is mostly due to these
   shortcomings that applications in continuous monitoring of, e.g.,
   drinking or surface water quality are largely missing. We propose the
   use of pipetting robots that can be used to automatically exchange
   samples in multiwell plates with fresh samples in a semi-static manner,
   as a potential solution to overcome these limitations. In this study, we
   developed a simple and low-cost, versatile pipetting robot constructed
   partly using open source hardware that has a small footprint and can be
   used for online monitoring of water quality by means of an automated
   whole-organism bioassay. We tested its precision in automated 2-fold
   dilution series and used it for exposure of zebrafish embryos (Danio
   rerio) a common model species in ecotoxicology to cadmium chloride and
   permethrin. We found that, compared to conventional static or
   semi-static exposure scenarios, effects of the two chemicals in
   zebrafish embryos generally occurred at lower concentrations, and
   analytically verified that the increased frequency of media exchange
   resulted in a greater availability of the chemical. In combination with
   advanced detection systems this custom-made pipetting robot has the
   potential to become a valuable tool in future monitoring strategies for
   drinking and surface water.}},

   Aerial Vehicles to Monitor Concentrated Solar Power Plants}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Concentrated solar power (CSP) plants are increasingly gaining interest
   as a source of renewable energy. These plants face several technical
   problems and the inspection of components such as absorber tubes in
   parabolic trough concentrators (PTC), which are widely deployed, is
   necessary to guarantee plant efficiency. This article presents a system
   for real-time industrial inspection of CSP plants using low-cost,
   open-source components in conjunction with a thermographic sensor and an
   unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The system, available in open-source
   hardware and software, is designed to be employed independently of the
   type of device used for inspection (laptop, smartphone, tablet or
   smartglasses) and its operating system. Several UAV flight missions were
   programmed as follows: flight altitudes at 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 m
   above ground level; and three cruising speeds: 5, 7 and 10 m/s. These
   settings were chosen and analyzed in order to optimize inspection time.
   The results indicate that it is possible to perform inspections by an
   UAV in real time at CSP plants as a means of detecting anomalous
   absorber tubes and improving the effectiveness of methodologies
   currently being utilized. Moreover, aside from thermographic sensors,
   this contribution can be applied to other sensors and can be used in a
   broad range of applications where real-time georeferenced data
   visualization is necessary.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{As low-cost desktop 3D printing is now dominated by free and open source
   self-replicating rapid prototype (RepRap) derivatives, there is an
   intense interest in extending the scope of potential applications to
   manufacturing. This study describes a manufacturing technology that
   enables a constrained set of polymer-metal composite components. This
   paper provides (1) free and open source hardware and (2) software for
   printing systems that achieves metal wire embedment into a polymer
   matrix 3D-printed part via a novel weaving and wrapping method using (3)
   OpenSCAD and parametric coding for customized g-code commands. Composite
   parts are evaluated from the technical viability of manufacturing and
   quality. The results show that utilizing a multi-polymer head system for
   multi-component manufacturing reduces manufacturing time and reduces the
   embodied energy of manufacturing. Finally, it is concluded that an open
   source software and hardware tool chain can provide low-cost industrial
   manufacturing of complex metal-polymer composite-based products.}},

Abstract = {{We are developing room temperature electronics based upon the ROACH
   platform to readout microwave multiplexed X-ray TES. ROACH is an
   open-source hardware and software platform featuring a large Xilinx
   Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), Power PC processor, several 10 GB
   Ethernet SFP+ interfaces, and a collection of daughter boards for analog
   signal generation and acquisition. The combination of a ROACH board,
   ADC/DAC conversion daughter boards, and hardware for RF mixing allows
   for the generation and capture of multiple RF tones for reading out
   microwave multiplexed X-ray TES microcalorimeters. The FPGA is used to
   generate multiple tones in base band, from 10 MHz to 250 MHz, which are
   subsequently mixed to RF in the multiple GHz range and sent through the
   microwave multiplexer. The tones are generated in theFPGAby storing a
   large lookup table in Quad Data Rate SRAM modules and playing out the
   waveform to a DAC board. Once the signal has been modulated to RF,
   passed through the microwave multiplexer, and has been modulated back to
   base band, the signal is digitized by an ADC board. The tones are
   modulated to 0 Hz by using a FPGA circuit consisting of a polyphase
   filter bank, several Xilinx FFT blocks, Xilinx CORDIC blocks (for
   converting to magnitude and phase), and special phase accumulator
   circuit for mixing to exactly 0 Hz. Upwards of 256 channels can be
   simultaneously captured and written into a bank of 256
   First-In-First-Out (FIFO) memories, with each FIFO corresponding to a
   channel. Individual channel data can be further processed in the FPGA
   before being streamed through a 10 GB Ethernet fiber-optic interface to
   a Linux system. The Linux system runs software written in Python and QT
   C++ for controlling the ROACH system, capturing data, and processing
   data.}},

Title = {{Openspritzer: an open hardware pressure ejection system for reliably
   delivering picolitre volumes}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAY 19}},
Abstract = {{The ability to reliably and precisely deliver picolitre volumes is an
   important component of biological research. Here we describe a
   high-performance, low-cost, open hardware pressure ejection system
   (Openspritzer), which can be constructed from off the shelf components.
   The device is capable of delivering minute doses of reagents to a wide
   range of biological and chemical systems. In this work, we characterise
   the performance of the device and compare it to a popular commercial
   system using twophoton fluorescence microscopy. We found that
   Openspritzer provides the same level of control over delivered reagent
   dose as the commercial system. Next, we demonstrate the utility of
   Openspritzer in a series of standard neurobiological applications.
   First, we used Openspritzer to deliver precise amounts of reagents to
   hippocampal neurons to elicit time-and dose-precise responses on
   neuronal voltage. Second, we used Openspritzer to deliver infectious
   viral and bacterial agents to living tissue. This included viral
   transfection of hippocampal interneurons with channelrhodopsin for the
   optogenetic manipulation of hippocampal circuitry with light. We
   anticipate that due to its high performance and low cost Openspritzer
   will be of interest to a broad range of researchers working in the life
   and physical sciences.}},

Abstract = {{Sorting is an extremely important computation kernel that has been
   accelerated in a lot of fields such as databases, image processing, and
   genome analysis. Given that advent of Internet of Things (IoT) era due
   to mobile technology progressions, the future needs a sorting method
   that is available on any environment, such as not only high performance
   systems like servers but also low computational performance machines
   like embedded systems. In this paper, we present an FPGA-based sorting
   accelerator combining Sorting Network and Merge Sorter Tree, which is
   customizable by means of tuning design parameters. The proposed FPGA
   accelerator sorts data sent from a host PC via the PCIe bus, and sends
   back the fully sorted data sequence to it. We also present a detailed
   analytical model that accurately estimates the sorting performance. Due
   to these characteristics, designers can know how fast a developed
   sorting hardware is in advance and can implement the best one to fulfill
   the cost and performance constraints. Our experiments show that the
   proposed hardware achieves up to 19.5x sorting performance, compared
   with Intel Core i7-3770K operating at 3.50GHz, when sorting 256M 32-bits
   integer elements. However, this result is limited because of
   insufficient memory bandwidth. To overcome this problem, we propose a
   data compression mechanism and the experimental result shows that the
   sorting hardware with it achieves almost 90\% of the estimated
   performance, while the hardware without it does about 60\%. In order to
   allow every designer to easily and freely use this accelerator, the RTL
   source code is released as open-source hardware.}},

Abstract = {{We describe the use of a low-cost commercial flatbed scanner in the
   undergraduate teaching laboratory to image large (similar to 25 cm)
   interference and diffraction patterns in two dimensions. Such scanners
   usually have an 8-bit linear photosensor array that can scan large areas
   (similar to 28 cm x 22 cm) at very high spatial resolutions (similar to
   100 Megapixels), which makes them versatile large-format imaging
   devices. We describe how the scanner can be used to image interference
   and diffraction from rectangular single-slit, double-slit, and circular
   apertures. The experiments are very simple to setup and require no
   specialized components besides a small laser and a flatbed scanner. Due
   to the presence of Automatic Gain Control in the scanner, which we were
   not able to override, we were unable to get an excellent fit to the
   data. Interestingly, we found that the less-than-ideal data were
   actually pedagogically superior as it forced the students to think about
   the process of data acquisition in much greater detail instead of simply
   performing the experiment mechanically. (C) 2017 American Association of

   considering two examples of open-source projects from our own research

Year = {{2017}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{We are surrounded by increasingly complex networks of smart objects, yet
   our understanding and attachment to them is rather limited. One way to
   support stronger end users' engagement with such complex technologies is
   by involving them in the design process and, with the advent of Arduino
   prototyping platform, even in their making. While DIY practice offers
   the potential for stronger user engagement with physical artifacts, we
   know little about end users' DIY practice of making complex electronic
   technologies and their potential to ensure engagement with such devices.
   In this article, we report on interviews with 18 participants from two
   green communities who built and used an open source DIY energy monitor,
   with the aim to explore the end users DIY practices of making such
   complex electronic devices. Findings indicate four key qualities of DIY
   monitors: transparent modularity, open-endedness, heirloom, and
   disruptiveness, and how they contribute to more meaningful engagement
   with the DIY monitors, elevating them from the status of unremarkable
   objects to that of things. We conclude with three implications for
   design for supporting end user development of complex electronic DIY:
   designing transparent open hardware technologies, standardizing
   communication protocols for the current and future DIY of IoT, and
   deliberately calling for personal investment and labor in the assembling
   of DIY kits.}},

Abstract = {{Implantable neuronal interfaces to the brain are an important keystone
   for future medical applications. However, entering this field of
   research is difficult since such an implant requires components from
   many different areas of technology. Since the complete avoidance of
   wires is important due to the risk of infections and other long-term
   problems, means for wirelessly transmitting data and energy are a
   necessity which adds to the requirements. In recent literature, many
   high-tech components for such implants are presented with remarkable
   properties. However, these components are typically not freely available
   for such a system. Every group needs to re-develop their own solution.
   This raises the question if it is possible to create a reusable design
   for an implant and its external base-station, such that it allows other
   groups to use it as a starting point. In this article, we try to answer
   this question by presenting a design based exclusively on commercial
   off-the-shelf components and studying the properties of the resulting
   system. Following this idea, we present a fully wireless neuronal
   implant for simultaneously measuring electrocorticography signals at 128
   locations from the surface of the brain. All design files are available
   as open source.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) printing technology is considered to be a major
   driving innovation in tissue engineering, since a custom-made
   manufacturing for patients is essential for tissue and organ generation.
   Depending on the bio-materials and the applications, various 3D
   bio-printing technologies are used. A system capable of printing a
   variety of bio-materials through various methods is required for
   fabrication of hybrid scaffolds for tissue engineering research. This
   paper describes the design and integration of a multi-channel 3D
   bio-printing system at an affordable price based on open source hardware
   and software. The hardware and software components of the 3D
   bio-printing system and the process of finding optimal printing
   conditions are described in the paper. Fabrication of the hybrid
   scaffold of synthetic polymer and cell loaded hydrogel are presented to
   validate the performance of the system.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet of Things, or the IoT, is an emerging, disruptive
   technology that enables physical devices to communicate across disparate
   networks. IP has been the de facto standard for seamless
   interconnectivity in the traditional Internet; and piggybacking on the
   success of IP, 6LoWPAN has been the first standardized technology to
   realize it for networks of resource-constrained devices. In the recent
   past Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) a.k.a Bluetooth Smart - a subset of the
   Bluetooth v4.0 and the latest v4.2 stack, has surfaced as an appealing
   alternative, with many competing advantages over available low-power
   communication technologies in the IoT space such as IEEE 802.15.4.
   However, BLE is a closed standard and lacks open hardware and firmware
   support, something that hinders innovation and development in this
   field. In this article, we aim to overcome some of the constraints in
   BLE's core building blocks by making three contributions: first, we
   present the design of a new open hardware platform for BLE; second, we
   provide a Contiki O.S. port for the new platform; and third, we identify
   research challenges and opportunities in 6LoWPAN-connected Bluetooth
   Smart. We believe that the knowledge and insights will facilitate IoT
   innovations based on this promising technology. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{A method for directly measuring carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions using a
   mobile sensor network in cities at fine spatial resolution was developed
   and tested. First, a com-pact, mobile system was built using an infrared
   gas analyzer combined with open-source hardware to control,
   georeference, and log measurements of CO2 mixing ratios on ve-hicles
   (car, bicycles). Second, two measurement campaigns, one in summer and
   one in winter (heating season) were carried out. Five mobile sensors
   were deployed within a 1x12.7 km transect across the city of Vancouver,
   BC, Canada. The sensors were operated for 3.5 h on pre-defined routes to
   map CO2 mixing ratios at street level, which were then averaged to 100 x
   100m grid cells. The averaged CO2 mixing ratios of all grids in the
   study area were 417.9 ppm in summer and 442.5 ppm in winter. In both
   campaigns, mixing ratios were highest in the grid cells of the downtown
   core and along arterial roads and lowest in parks and well vegetated
   residential areas. Third, an aerodynamic resistance approach to
   calculating emissions was used to derive CO2 emissions from the gridded
   CO2 mixing ratio mea-surements in conjunction with mixing ratios and
   fluxes collected from a 28 m tall eddycovariance tower located within
   the study area. These measured emissions showed a range of 12 to
   226CO(2) ha 1 h 1 in summer and of -14 to 163 kgCO(2) ha 1 h 1 in
   winter, with an average of 35.1 kgCO(2) ha (-1) h (-1) (summer) and 25.9
   kgCO(2) ha 1 h 1 (winter). Fourth, an independent emissions inventory
   was developed for the study area using buildings energy simulations from
   a previous study and routinely available traffic counts. The emissions
   inventory for the same area averaged to 22.06 kgCO(2) ha (-1) h (-1)
   (summer) and 28.76 kgCO(2) ha (-1) h (-1) (winter) and was used to
   compare against the measured emissions from the mobile sensor network.
   The comparison on a grid-by-grid basis showed linearity between CO2
   mixing ratios and the emissions inventory (R (2) =53 in summer and R (2)
   = 47 in winter). Also, 87\% (summer) and 94\% (winter) of measured grid
   cells show a difference within +/- 1 order of magnitude, and 49\%
   (summer) and 69\% (winter) show an error of less than a factor 2.
   Although associated with considerable errors at the individual grid cell
   level, the study demonstrates a promising method of using a network of
   mobile sensors and an aerody-namic resistance approach to rapidly map
   greenhouse gases at high spatial resolution across cities. The method
   could be improved by longer measurements and a refined calculation of
   the aerodynamic resistance.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we introduce a modulation strategy for comprehensive
   two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC) by using a simple and
   consumable-free modulator. This ``Do-It-Yourself{''} interface comprised
   a 1.0 mx0.25 mm segment of MTX-5 metallic column and a low-cost DC power
   supply. Thermal desorption modulation (TDM) was attained using a
   dual-stage heater-based modulator in a novel segmented-loop
   configuration. TDM was achieved by alternating analyte trapping and
   thermal desorption. Former process relied on analyte partition to
   sorbent phase, while latter explored direct resistive heating.
   Introduction of an intermediate delay segment between the two stages
   mitigated analyte breakthrough, improving peak symmetry and
   chromatographic efficiency. This feature was critical to acquire
   reliable GCxGC modulation using such simple heater-based device. The
   effects of important modulation variables on 2D separations were
   investigated, including TDM stage length, dimension of delay loop, and
   outlet pressure. Significant advances and limitations of proposed TDM
   strategy were carefully determined. Proposed GCxGC prototype by using an
   in-oven TDM modulator was successfully applied to a series of
   challenging matrices, including petroleum distillates, biodiesel, and
   essential oil. This open-hardware, cost-effective modulator was easy to
   install and operate, as it circumvented the need for sophisticated
   components (e.g. moving parts and cooling systems). Therefore, our
   modulator is a compelling alternative to existing GCxGC solutions to
   operate in resource-limited laboratories.}},

Abstract = {{Three dimensional (3d) printer technologies are rapidly developing and
   increasingly being used in several fields. In this study, as a first
   step a 3d printer is constructed by modifying open source hardware and
   controlled by improving open source software. Subsequently, an ankle
   foot orthosis (AFO) is designed and constructed by using this 3d
   printer.
   The ankle foot orthosis, very important for human walking, is designed
   to control motion of the ankle and prevents deformities. An AFO can
   generally be used for following purposes: brace weak limbs, grasp ankle
   and foot in the right position and correct the foot drop. Since the
   users have different sizes of ankles and different types of deformities,
   an AFO must be produced to match in size to the end-user. Therefore
   off-the-shelf AFOs may not suitable for the each end user. Considering
   these factors, 3d printers are of great importance for producing
   individualized biomedical equipment. In this study, a distinctive ankle
   foot orthosis is first modelled by using CAD software and then produced
   by using constructed 3d printer. This AFO is the first ankle foot
   orthosis produced by a 3d printer in the literature of our country. This
   study is a proof that biomedical equipments can be produced in a shorter
   time and less costly by using 3d printers.}},

Abstract = {{Scientists have begun using self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap)
   3-D printers to manufacture open source digital designs of scientific
   equipment. This approach is refined here to develop a novel instrument
   capable of performing automated large-area four-point probe
   measurements. The designs for conversion of a RepRap 3-D printer to a
   2-D open source four-point probe (OS4PP) measurement device are detailed
   for the mechanical and electrical systems. Free and open source software
   and firmware are developed to operate the tool. The OS4PP was validated
   against a wide range of discrete resistors and indium tin oxide (ITO)
   samples of different thicknesses both pre- and post-annealing. The OS4PP
   was then compared to two commercial proprietary systems. Results of
   resistors from 10 to 1 M show errors of less than 1\% for the OS4PP. The
   3-D mapping of sheet resistance of ITO samples successfully demonstrated
   the automated capability to measure non-uniformities in large-area
   samples. The results indicate that all measured values are within the
   same order of magnitude when compared to two proprietary measurement
   systems. In conclusion, the OS4PP system, which costs less than 70\% of
   manual proprietary systems, is comparable electrically while offering
   automated 100 micron positional accuracy for measuring sheet resistance
   over larger areas.}},

   foreground the social and collaborative aspects of CS. Collectively,
   these activities are designed to introduce learners to the growing
   diversity of what CS looks like in the 21st century. This paper lays out
   the practical and theoretical motivations for the Computational Thinking
   for Girls (CT4G) project, specifically highlighting the use of Making
   through physical and social computing as ways to engage students in CS.
   A snapshot of one activity from the program is provided-Wearing the
   Web-in which students use open-hardware programmable badges to explore
   the underlying structure and technology that enables the Internet. Data

Abstract = {{A highly versatile Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) system,
   nicknamed the ScouseTom, has been developed. The systemallows control
   over current amplitude, frequency, number of electrodes, injection
   protocol and data processing. Current is injected using a Keithley 6221
   current source, and voltages are recordedwith a 24-bit
   EEGsystemwithminimumbandwidth of 3.2 kHz. Custom PCBs interface with a
   PC to control the measurement process, electrode addressing and
   triggering of external stimuli. The performance of the system was
   characterised using resistor phantoms to represent human scalp
   recordings, with an SNR of 77.5 dB, stable across a four hour recording
   and 20 Hz to 20 kHz. In studies of both haeomorrhage using scalp
   electrodes, and evoked activity using epicortical electrode mats in
   rats, it was possible to reconstruct images matching established
   literature at known areas of onset. Data collected using scalp electrode
   in humans matched known tissue impedance spectra and was stable over
   frequency. The experimental procedure is software controlled and is
   readily adaptable to new paradigms. Where possible, commercial or
   open-source components were used, to minimise the complexity in
   reproduction. The hardware designs and software for the system have been
   released under an open source licence, encouraging contributions and
   allowing for rapid replication.}},

Abstract = {{Drowsy driving is the primary cause of motor vehicle accidents and is a
   risk factor that leads to the loss of human life, remaining as a
   challenge for the global automotive industry. Recently, drowsy
   monitoring system has been actively studied for prediction system based
   machine learning. However, the challenges of automotive real-time
   constraints and flexibility should be taken into consideration against a
   large amount of heterogeneous data from vehicle network and other
   device. To solve this problem, we propose drowsy monitoring system based
   machine learning using GS1 standard. First, vehicle motion data is
   defined and modeled using the GS1 standard language for drowsy predict.
   Second, we propose an optimal algorithm selection and detail
   architecture for automotive real-time environments through machine
   learning algorithms (KNN, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression) and deep
   learning algorithms (RNN-LSTM). Finally, we describe system-wide
   integration and implementation through the open source hardware
   Raspberry Pi and the machine learning SW framework We provide optimal
   LSTM architecture and implementation that takes into account the
   real-time environmental conditions and how to improve the readability
   and usability of the vehicle motion data. We also share the rapid
   prototyping methodology case of connected car systems without other

Abstract = {{There are several specific solutions for accessing sensors and actuators
   present in any process or system through a TCP/IP network, either local
   or a wide area type like the Internet. The usage of sensors and
   actuators of different nature and diverse interfaces (SPI, I2C,
   analogue, etc.) makes access to them from a network in a homogeneous and
   secure way more complex. A framework, including both software and
   hardware resources, is necessary to simplify and unify networked access
   to these devices. In this paper, a set of open-source software tools,
   specifically designed to cover the different issues concerning the
   access to sensors and actuators, and two proposed low-cost hardware
   architectures to operate with the abovementioned software tools are
   presented. They allow integrated and easy access to local or remote
   sensors and actuators. The software tools, integrated in the free
   authoring tool Easy Java and Javascript Simulations (EJS) solve the
   interaction issues between the subsystem that integrates sensors and
   actuators into the network, called convergence subsystem in this paper,
   and the Human Machine Interface (HMI)-this one designed using the
   intuitive graphical system of EJS-located on the user's computer. The
   proposed hardware architectures and software tools are described and
   experimental implementations with the proposed tools are presented.}},

   Health Hazards Related to Fossil Fuel Extraction}},
Journal = {{ENGAGING SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2017}},

Abstract = {{How can STS researchers collaborate with communities to design
   environmental monitoring devices that more effectively express their
   experiences and address gaps in regulation? This paper describes and
   shows the results of a novel method of visualizing environmental
   emissions of corrosive gases such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S) exposure
   using photographic paper. H2S is a neurotoxic and flammable gas that
   smells like rotten eggs and is frequently associated with oil and
   natural gas extraction. Communities living with oil and gas development
   in Wyoming report odors of rotten eggs and describe symptoms of H2S
   exposure. H2S is recognized as an acute and chronic threat to human and
   environmental health and oil and gas companies are required to have
   plans in place to prevent and respond to accidental, high concentration
   releases of H2S. They are not, however, required to monitor, report or
   prevent routine daily emissions. Yet 15-25\% of the oil and gas wells in
   the US are predicted to contain H2S, and some communities surrounded by
   multiple wells report chronic, routine exposure. Chronic exposure is
   difficult to represent with current tools for monitoring H2S because
   they are designed to measure acute workplace exposure. Informed by STS
   theories of black boxes and regimes of imperceptibility that focus on
   the need to revise not only regulations but also material tools of
   science, this paper describes the development of an indexical approach
   to visualizing this hazard. In indexical design, the reactive sensing
   element of a scientific instrument is brought to the foreground. The
   silver in the photopaper is an index as it tarnishes with H2S exposure.
   Discolored tests strips can be arranged together to form data-rich maps
   of the exposure landscape where this discoloration both represents how
   the gas spreads through a space and is a physical trace of the gas.
   Preliminary results in the form of data-rich maps show that regulating
   H2S emissions as primarily accidental is inappropriate and fails to
   adequately protect human health.}},

Abstract = {{Robotics is one of the major disruptive technologies of our time, and
   offers significant opportunities for innovation and competitiveness in
   the global marketplace. However, in resource-poor countries like India,
   engineering education is hampered by a lack of access to affordable and
   innovative hands-on practical education modules for the laboratory. This
   is especially the case in emerging disciplines like robotics. Moreover,
   expensive commercial grade robots offer limited scope for
   experimentation and learning outcomes in an academic setting. This
   situation can be remedied with the increasing affordability and
   versatility of open source hardware like microcontrollers and
   microcomputers, commercial off-the-shelf components like motors,
   actuators, sensors and power transmission mechanisms, as well as free,
   open source software. In this paper, a low-cost build your own (BYO)
   three-link electrically actuated robot manipulator is designed and
   developed for adoption in robotics and mechatronics laboratory courses.
   It can be disseminated and adapted on a wide scale at affordable cost
   for hands-on manufacturing education.}},

   hardware design to enable rapid deployment and live monitoring of
   temperature within zones such as rooms. This enables evaluation of HVAC
   system efficiency, and building parameter monitoring in that room. This
   paper presents our HVAC, thermal, and building parameter monitoring
   system design and considerations using an open-source hardware approach

Abstract = {{Soil and nutrient depletion from intensive use of land is a critical
   issue for food production. An understanding of whether the soil is
   adequately treated with appropriate crop management practices in
   real-time during production cycles could prevent soil erosion and the
   overuse of natural or artificial resources to keep the soil healthy and
   suitable for planting. Precision agriculture traditionally uses
   expensive techniques to monitor the health of soil and crops including
   images from satellites and airplanes. Recently there are several studies
   using drones and a multitude of sensors connected to farm machinery to
   observe and measure the health of soil and crops during planting and
   harvesting. This paper describes a real-time, in-situ agricultural
   internet of things (IoT) device designed to monitor the state of the
   soil and the environment. This device was designed to be compatible with
   open hardware and it is composed of temperature and humidity sensors
   (soil and environment), electrical conductivity of the soil and
   luminosity, Global Positioning System (GPS) and a ZigBee radio for data
   communication. The field trial involved soil testing and measurements of
   the local climate in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The measurements of soil
   temperature, humidity and conductivity are used to monitor soil
   conditions. The local climate data could be used to support decisions
   about irrigation and other activities related to crop health. On-going
   research includes methods to reduce the consumption of energy and
   increase the number of sensors. Future applications include the use of
   the IoT device to detect fire in crops, a common problem in sugar cane
   crops and the integration of the IoT device with irrigation management
   systems to improve water usage.}},

Abstract = {{Distributed manufacturing, where decentralized small, local sites are
   engaged in production, often supported by digital systems and networks,
   can be a powerful tool in humanitarian aid. Field Ready uses distributed
   manufacturing to produce essential non-food items locally where they are
   needed during humanitarian responses. Such supplies can be available to
   communities in need and to relief workers more quickly, more cheaply
   than alternatives, and provide appropriate solutions to problems, often
   engaging local people in designing and making necessary items, and
   supporting economic development. Scaling up this requires local
   production capabilities (skills, tools, and information such as
   designs), which can be boosted by adoption of these methods by aid
   agencies, international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) and
   others. Local manufacturing offers the potential for disaster affected
   communities to be engaged in recovery, and long term to become more
   resilient, with access to all the equipment and information required to
   make the supplies they need. However, there are challenges: appropriate
   quality control for distributed manufacture, unlocking the potential for
   in-region manufacturers to engage in humanitarian response, and uptake
   of digital knowledge sharing and collaboration to the humanitarian

Abstract = {{This paper designs and implements a smart garden system that can be used
   inside the house. To do this, we used particle filter and environmental
   sensors, which are open hardware controllers, and designed to control
   and observe automatic water supply, lighting, and growth monitoring with
   three wireless systems (Bluetooth, Ethernet, Wi-Fi). This system has
   been developed to make it possible to use it in an indoor space such as
   an apartment, rather than a large-scale cultivation system such as a
   conventional plant factory which has already been widely used. The
   developed system collects environmental data by using soil sensor,
   illuminance sensor, humidity sensor and temperature sensor as well as
   control through smartphone app, analyzes the collected data, and
   controls water pump, LED lamp, air ventilation fan and so on. As a
   wireless remote control method, we implemented Bluetooth, Ethernet and
   Wi-Fi. Finally, it is designed for users to enable remote control and
   monitoring when the user is not in the house.}},

Abstract = {{The demand of the industry for high performance electric motors has
   significantly increased nowadays. This has boosted the usage of
   permanent magnet brushless synchronous motors (BLSM) in many
   applications where the accuracy and performance requirements are high.
   Further improvement of the BLSM drive systems performance can be
   achieved by providing them with adaptive control capabilities. The
   relative complexity of adaptive control schemes and algorithms and the
   computational load that they impose have prevented until recently their
   practical implementation into the industrial servo systems. In this
   investigation, a neuro-adaptive control scheme where the rule for
   parameter adaptation is designed by taking into account the variable
   structure control (VSC) concepts and Lyapunov stability, is proposed and
   embedded into an inexpensive, available on the market, position control
   system for brushless synchronous servomotors. The experimental tests
   have been carried on using compact and flexible, based on open hardware
   and software concept, dual-axis motion controllers PMC201/PMC202
   manufactured by the PicoMotion Inc. The applied software has been
   written using the Motion Control Framework software platform, provided
   together with the above controllers. The results obtained with the
   proposed neuro-adaptive control scheme have been compared to those
   obtained using the originally built into the system PI controller. The
   experiments have shown that the implemented advanced adaptive control
   approach is practically viable and can be embedded into the industrial
   motion control systems which will lead to their improved performance.}},

Abstract = {{In the last few years, a demand for renewed product personalisation to
   satisfy the exact need of the customers has been observed in some
   markets. As opposed to customisation, which put emphasis on the
   satisfaction of explicit needs of a defined market segment,
   individualisation aims at satisfying the specific needs of a customer.
   Product design for Mass Individualisation (MI) is a new product design
   paradigm that comprises an open hardware platform and multiple modules
   that are integrated with the platform, as per end-users' choice. This
   paper identifies key areas and components which need to be focused to
   realise this approach and convert it into an industrial practice by an
   explorative study of existing product design and customisation
   approaches. A questionnaire survey has been conducted and results are
   presented for the industrial implication and insights on this approach.
   The findings clearly show that MI provides most individualised and
   technologically advanced product.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with e-learning design and development training
   courses, more precisely with remote training by practical activities of
   laboratory experiments (E-Lab). Indeed. the majority of remote training
   platforms offer theoretical courses and a few practical activities.
   which are essential in training theoretical Science and Technology. In
   order to share the costly equipment, in this work, we propose an open
   hardware/software architecture allowing remote access to a laboratory
   equipment by designing in Matlab two graphical interfaces using
   Internet/Intranet network and TCP/IP communication protocol. A real-time
   control and supervision is performed to carry out all the practical
   activity according to a pedagogical scenario elaborated by the trainer.
   The use of these interfaces is illustrated by educational sessions
   articulated on the Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) regulation and
   the Generalized Predictive Control (GPC) of temperature control system.
   The challenge of elaborating a remote practical activity with
   pedagogical effectiveness is accomplished in the above proposed
   solution. All the hardware and software that made available the remote
   experimentation platform give possibility to achieve others traditional
   activities in experimentation laboratory.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the Pi-puck extension board - an interface between
   the e-puck robot platform and a Raspberry Pi single-board computer that
   enhances the processing power, memory capacity, and networking
   capabilities of the robot at a low cost. It allows high-level control
   algorithms, wireless communication, and computationally expensive
   operations such as real-time image processing to be handled by a
   Raspberry Pi, while the e-puck's microcontroller deals with low-level
   motor control and sensor interfacing.
   Although two similar extension boards for the e-puck robot platform
   already exist, they are now out-dated and expensive in comparison. Our
   open-source hardware design and supporting software infrastructure offer
   an inexpensive upgrade to the e-puck robot, transforming it into the
   Pi-puck - a modern and flexible new platform for mobile robotics
   research.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reflects on the dynamics and practices of building a maker
   community around a new hardware platform. We examine the factors
   promoting the successful uptake of a maker platform from two
   perspectives: first, we investigate the technical and user experience
   considerations that users identify as the most important. Second, we
   explore the specific activities that help attract a community and
   encourage sustained participation. We present an inductive approach
   based on the case study of Bela, an embedded platform for creating
   interactive audio systems. The technical design and community building
   processes are detailed, culminating in a successful crowdfunding
   campaign. To further understand the community dynamics, the paper also
   presents an intensive three-day workshop with eight digital musical
   instrument designers. From observations and interviews, we reflect on
   the relationship between the platform and the community and offer
   suggestions for HCI researchers and practitioners interested in
   establishing their own maker communities.}},

Abstract = {{Because of the rapid development of EtherCAT as the standard fieldbus in
   control and automation and the increasing demands of low cost portable
   main controllers, we aim to assess the performance of an EtherCAT
   network in handling real-time demands using open source EtherCAT master
   protocol on open hardware platforms. In comparison to that of commercial
   products, the performance of open platforms is still indefinite and may
   depend on different indicators such as the kernel version, real-time
   architecture, and the protocol of EtherCAT. This paper provides
   implementation guidelines and procedures to develop the embedded
   platforms-a task which is difficult due to lack of systematic documents
   and technical support. The real-time evaluation of an open source
   EtherCAT master with a dual-kernel approach of real-time embedded Linux,
   Xenomai, is performed to validate that even low-cost open embedded
   hardware platforms are also capable in performing real-time EtherCAT

   proposes an open platform of a WiFi-enabled indoor air quality
   monitoring and control system, which could be incorporated into such a
   `smart building' structure. The complete software and hardware design of
   this system is presented, along with a series of control experiments.
   The proposed system operates over an existing WiFi wireless network
   utilising the MQTT protocol. It is capable of monitoring the indoor air
   quality as well as controlling an air purifier to regulate the
   particulate matters concentration. Experiment results under a real world

Abstract = {{Tangible learning is a promising branch, especially for scientific
   learning, allowing an enhanced sensorial involvement and participation
   by children. While a lot is being done on the side of programming, less
   has been investigated on elementary spatial and geometric concepts. The
   paper presents i-Vertex, an open -hardware framework for tangible
   serious games on geometry concepts for primary school pupils. The
   framework targets spatial reasoning and includes music as a related and
   complementary feature, which should add value also for usability.
   i-Vertex supports collaboration between kids and the key role of a
   teacher as an adult that interacts with the children in different ways,
   introducing them to the discovery and understanding of basic geometric
   concepts and physical phenomenon. At present, we have built a prototype,
   featuring a very limited number of vertices, and functionally tested it
   in lab, in two main scenarios covering topics such as lines and
   triangles. Based on the successful feedback of this experiment, we
   intend to proceed further, upgrading the platform with a more powerful
   and product oriented micro-controller and board.}},

   Architecture designed for supporting security applications, while
   leveraging on the capabilities offered by dedicated Open Hardware
   devices. Specifically, we target the the SEcubeTM platform, an Open
   Hardware security platform based on a 3D SiP (System on Package)
   designed and produced by Blu5 Group. The platform integrates three
   components employed for security in a single package: a Cortex-M4 CPU, a
   FPGA and an EAL5+ certified Smart Card. The Open Software Architecture
   targets both the host machine and the security device, together with the
   secure communication among them. To maximize its usability, this
   architecture is organized in several abstraction layers, ranging from
   hardware interfaces to device drivers, from security APIs to advanced
   applications, like secure messaging and data protection. We aim at
   releasing a multi-platform Open Source security framework, where
   software and hardware cooperate to hide to both the developer and the
   final users classical security concepts like cryptographic algorithms
   and keys, focusing, instead, on common operational security concepts

Abstract = {{Since the demand for more bandwidth, agile infrastructures and services
   grows, it becomes challenging for Service Providers like GEANT to manage
   the proprietary underlay, while keeping costs low. In such a scenario,
   Software Defined Networking (SDN), open hardware and open source
   software prove to be key components to address those challenges. After
   one year of development, SDX-L2 and BoD, the SDN-ization of the GEANT
   Open and Bandwidth on Demand (BoD) services, have been brought to the
   pilot status and GEANT is now testing the outcomes on its operational
   network. In this demonstration, we show BoD and SDX-L2 ``going live{''}
   at the GEANT production infrastructure. The pilots run on the same
   underlay infrastructure thanks to the virtualization capabilities of the
   network devices. Provisioning of the services is covered during the
   demo. In the final steps of the demonstration, we show how the
   infrastructure is able to automatically manage network events and how it
   remains operational in the case of fault events.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, more and more organizations are aware of the increasing
   potential of nanoscience and nanotechnology, due to the wide field of
   innovative applications they address from biomedical and molecular
   technology to semiconductor and material sciences. Nanotechnology is an
   area where fundamental or applicative research is still in progress and
   where many industrial applications are waited to come. Despite the
   progress of this field, many institutions, notably educational ones,
   cannot afford investing in these technologies allowing an access to
   nanoscale, and a lack of knowledge therefore remains. The Nanoeye
   project focuses on the widespread of Atomic Force Microscopy or AFM
   technology, which is the basic access tool to the nanoscale. The main
   goal is to design an optimal AFM model in terms of manufacturing costs
   by using rapid prototyping techniques and open-source hardware, and
   designing it as an educational-oriented equipment. This approach is
   two-fold: as an AFM-unexperienced user discovering its principle of
   operation at nanoscale or as a future engineer understanding its
   multi-disciplinary structure involving mechanics, optics, electronics,
   software and control sciences. This paper introduces the first
   functional structure of Nanoeye AFM project, focusing on its mechanical
   structure. It is submitted to the IFAC2017 special feature Automatic
   Control Demonstrators. (C) 2017, IFAC (International Federation of

Abstract = {{The chip industry faces two key challenges today the impending end of
   Moore's Law and the rising costs of chip design and verification
   (millions of dollars today). Heterogeneous IPs - cores and
   domain-specific accelerators - are a promising answer to the first
   challenge, enabling performance and energy benefits no longer provided
   by technology scaling. IP-reuse with plug-and-play designs can help with
   the second challenge, amortizing NRE costs tremendously. A key
   requirement in a heterogeneous IP-based plug-and-play SoC environment is
   an interconnection fabric to connect these IPs together. This fabric
   needs to be scalable - low latency, low energy and low area - and yet be
   flexible/parametrizable for use across designs. The key scalability
   challenge in any Network-on-Chip (NoC) today is that the latency
   increases proportional to the number of hops.
   In this work, we present a NoC generator called OpenSMART, which
   generates low-latency NoCs based on SMART(1). SMART is a recently
   proposed NoC microarchitecture that enables multi-hop on-chip traversals
   within a single cycle, removing the dependence of latency on hops. SMART
   leverages wire delay of the underlying repeated wires, and augments each
   router with the ability to request and setup bypass paths. OpenSMART
   takes SMART from a NoC optimization to a design methodology for SoCs,
   enabling users to generate verified RTL for a class of user-specified
   network configurations, such as network size, topology, routing
   algorithm, number of VCs/buffers, router pipeline stages, and so on.
   OpenSMART also provides the ability to generate any heterogeneous
   topology with low and high-radix routers and optimized single-stage
   pipelines, leveraging fast logic delays in technology nodes today.
   OpenSMART v1.0 comes with both Bluespec System Verilog and Chisel
   implementations, and this paper also presents a case study of our
   experiences with both languages. OpenSMART is available for download(2)
   and is going to be a key addition to the emerging open-source hardware
   movement, providing a glue for interconnecting existing and emerging
   IPs.}},

Abstract = {{Robotics has been used to draw the attention of young students to
   computing and engineering. Unfortunately, most hardware and software
   resources used to teach programming and robotics are not adequate for
   students with visual impairment (VI). For instance, most programming
   environments for young students are highly visual and the commercial
   robotics kits were not built for people with VI. This paper describes
   the main design requirements so that both the proposed robot hardware
   and the software can also be used by people with VI. The hardware part
   is the focus of this paper, a robot called Donnie. It consists of open
   hardware, a design with low-cost and easy to find parts, and a 3D
   printed structure. Our main contribution is the presentation of a
   low-cost Arduino-based robot, compatible with Player robotic framework
   and integrated with sound feedback and text-to-speech.}},

Abstract = {{An open hardware framework for approximating range and bearing of radio
   frequency (RF) sensors is presented. The current work has an immediate
   application in solving the simultaneous localization and mapping problem
   which is one of the challenging problems in the field of robotics. In
   this work, a set of RF sensors utilizing the ZigBee protocol are placed
   in an indoor environment and a base RF sensor is mounted within a
   rotating parabolic reflector on a mobile robot. The proposed range and
   bearing approximation framework works in two cascaded phases. In the
   first phase, the base RF sensor sends an RF signal to all other RF
   sensors within its operating range. These RF sensors then respond to the
   base RF module where ZigBee packets are parsed to store raw data for
   approximating range. In the second phase, a stepper motor is employed to
   rotate the parabolic reflector and the base RF sensor mounted on the
   robot. These two phases continue until a full revolution of 360 degrees
   has been achieved. The data is processed for approximating the bearing
   of each RF sensor with respect to the mobile robot's heading angle, as
   well as the distance (range) to the RF sensor at its associated bearing.
   The proposed hardware setup is validated through a set of experimental
   results gathered in an indoor environment.}},

Abstract = {{Open Source Hardware allows users to share, customize, and improve
   designs, thus enabling technological advancement through communities of
   practice. We propose open source hardware for educational haptics that
   permits researchers, educators, and students to share designs arising
   from their different perspectives, with the potential to expand
   educational applications. In this paper we present a family of open
   source kinesthetic haptic devices that build upon the design of a
   previous educational haptic device, Hapkit 3.0. First, we discuss
   methods for Hapkit personalization and customization that can be
   achieved by K-12 students and educators. Next, we describe two
   kinesthetic haptic device designs that evolved from the original Hapkit
   3.0. One uses two standard Hapkits with additional components to form a
   Pantograph mechanism, and the other uses customized Hapkit elements
   along with a novel kinematic design to form a serial mechanism. These
   designs are modular; after building two Hapkits, a user acquires a small
   number of additional parts to transform them into a
   two-degree-of-freedom device. The Pantograph mechanism was used in an
   undergraduate class to teach robotics and haptics to both engineering
   and non-engineering students. Open source designs for all devices as
   well as tutorials for customization are available at
   http://hapkit.stanford.edu.}},

Abstract = {{Although there are a large number of autonomous robot platforms for
   ground contact and flying robots, this has not been the case for
   underwater robotic platforms. This is not due to the lack of interesting
   applications in the shallow underwater domain (50m depth), but rather
   due to the relative cost of building such platforms. This has recently
   changed with the development of inexpensive thrusters and other
   underwater components. Leveraging these components and design principles
   learned from more expensive remotely operated vehicles this paper
   describes Milton, an inexpensive open hardware design for a traditional

Abstract = {{The concept of quality of life is used as a measure of the welfare of a
   society, highlighting the relationship between the environment and
   health, mainly associated with pollution. Hence the importance of
   monitoring and communicating its results, in a timely manner, to the
   community. But often the last part of the process fail, there is a lack
   of communication between data, information and community. Using open
   hardware and open source tools, and based on the Internet of things
   concept, a low-cost citizen monitoring network, that cost less than US
   \$150 was implemented. This network measures Carbon Monoxide (CO),
   Temperature, Relative Humidity, Particulate Matter 2.5, Noise and UV
   radiation, with a reading frequency of every 40 s and a hibernation
   period of 15 min. The environmental monitoring network gather
   information from the environment, through sensors, and then store it in
   a MySQL database, to finally be deployed in a web site hosted on a local
   web server Apache, implemented ex professo. In effect, the system is
   able to deliver geotagged information and the state of environmental
   pollution to the citizens.}},

Abstract = {{The primary objective of the paper is to construct and test a low-cost,
   minimally supervised gesture recognition system which identifies static
   gestures efficiently and accurately. The proposed system uses ADXL335
   accelerometer sensors which track the gestures and these sensors are
   interfaced with an Arduino ATMega 2560 micro-controller for data
   processing and gesture recognition. The software of the system
   implemented in the micro-controller, features a computationally feasible
   algorithm which requires only nominal resources to recognize the
   gestures. The paper further elucidates on minimizing the number of
   accelerometers to reduce the cost and power-consumption of the system.
   The performance of the system is assessed using static gestures in the
   alphabets of the American Sign Language (ASL) across data-sets obtained
   from 3 trained ASL signers. The average run-time efficiency of the
   proposed system with a maximum and minimum configuration of 5 and 2
   accelerometers was found to be 95.3\% and 87.0\%, with the cost of these
   prototype systems being realized at 20 USD and 12.5 USD respectively. It
   was also found that the system can be trained for the static gestures of
   the alphabets in ASL under two minutes by a new-user with any system
   configuration. The authors also feel that the system is compatible with
   other IoT platforms for interoperability.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, the water crisis is not only visible in Brazil but almost
   everywhere and it arises where water scarcity becomes a global challenge
   or environmental concerns about the shortage of drinking water. The need
   to have water available for consumption is critical, since, in turn, it
   is the main source for life on Earth. Despite all of Earth's water
   found, only 2.5\% of it is freshwater. From this smallest part, 70\% of
   it is used in agriculture, 23\% by industries and 7\% for human
   consumption. This paper presents an embedded system prototype for air
   dehumidifying which has the main purpose of obtaining water (by means of
   condensation). Others benefits include low cost, low size, portability
   and an Internet of Things application approach. The dehumidifier uses an
   aluminum plate around 36 cm(2) and about 0.5 mm thickness, a
   thermoelectric Peltier tablet, a breadboard UNO R3 arduino, wires
   jumper, transistors TIP122 and 1 K Omega (Ohm) resistors. Within the
   initial results, we verified the condensed water in the aluminum and the
   formation of water repeatedly and controlled.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of the development of a modular open

   from research on the automatic rotation start-up and landing of a
   tethered airplane for wind energy harvesting, implementing and testing
   promising theoretical concepts such as real-time moving horizon
   estimation (MHE) and non-linear model predictive control (NMPC) on
   hardware developed in parallel. As experimental setups for testing new
   control algorithms tend to be fine-tuned by trial and error methods, a
   rapid control prototyping system for fast evaluation had to be
   implemented. Technical results of this research are presented in the
   form of a modular platform for real-time control.
   The created platform provides a complete toolchain for performing,
   observing and evaluating control experiments. It offers modular low-cost
   hardware and free software especially suited for flight control
   experiments. Clearly defined interfaces between the components allow for
   expanding on its current capabilities for other control scenarios in
   need of fast and reliable real-time control. The provided modularity
   allows for spatial separation of high performance computing hardware
   from low-level components, permits rapid reconfiguration of the
   experiment and eases the collaboration and workflow between hardware
   developers and control engineers. (C) 2017, IFAC (International

Abstract = {{Enabled by modern languages and retargetable compilers, software
   development is in a virtual ``Cambrian explosion{''} driven by a
   critical mass of powerfully parameterized libraries; but hardware
   development practices lag far behind. We hypothesize that existing
   hardware construction languages (HCLs) and novel hardware compiler
   frameworks (HCFs) can put hardware development on a similar evolutionary
   path by enabling new hardware libraries to be independent of underlying
   process technologies including FPGA mappings. We support this claim by
   (1) evaluating the degree with which Chisel, an existing HCL, can
   support powerfully parameterized libraries, and (2) introducing the
   concept and implementation of an HCF that uses an open-source hardware
   intermediate representation, FIRRTL (Flexible Intermediate
   Representation for RTL), to transform target-independent RTL into
   technology-specific RTL. Finally, we evaluate many hardware compiler
   transformations, including simplifying transformations, analyses,
   optimizations, instrumentations, and specializations, which demonstrate
   the power of a combined HCL and HCF approach.}},

Abstract = {{Following the successful adoption of the open source model in the
   software realm, open source is becoming a new design paradigm in
   hardware development. Open source models for tangible products are still
   in its infancy, and many studies are required to demonstrate its
   application to for-profit product development. It is an alluring
   question why entrepreneurs decide to use an open model to develop their
   products under risks and unknowns, such as infringement and community
   management. The goal of this paper is to investigate the motivations of
   entrepreneurs of open source hardware companies. The leaders and
   founders of twenty-three companies were interviewed to understand their
   motivation and experiences in creating a company based on open source
   hardware. Based on these interviews, we generated a hierarchical
   framework to explain these motivations, where each level of the
   framework has been defined, explained and illustrated with
   representative quotes. The motivations of open source action are framed
   by two categories in the paper: 1) Intrinsic Motivation, which describes
   the motivations of an entrepreneur as an individual, who needs personal
   satisfaction, enjoyment as well as altruism and reciprocity; 2)
   Extrinsic Motivation, which describes motivations of an entrepreneur
   whose identity is as a for-profit company leader.}},

Abstract = {{Arduino boards, a current trending open-source platform technology, are
   being used by museums and other institutions to create interactive
   exhibits for their patrons. Academic libraries are often faced with the
   challenge of finding new inspirations to educate and engage patrons. The
   Illuminated Lifestyles exhibit at Binghamton University was an attempt
   to teach library users about the sensory experiences of medieval
   manuscripts using touch technology. Relatively inexpensive, these boards
   can be incorporated in various ways to make an exhibit interactive. In
   this case, the boards were used in conjunction with large-scale frames
   covered with digitized replicas of manuscript leaves that spoke to the
   viewer as they touched the images. This case study explains the
   technology and platforms used within the exhibit and what the long-term
   impacts and benefits, if any, the library experienced.}},

Abstract = {{Precision aquaculture is a new tool developed in the field of
   information technology (IT) that allows the farmers having a better
   control of the farm processes, facilitate the decisions making, and
   improve the efficiency of the activity. The development of systems for
   continuous monitoring are important to aquaculture crops since these can
   detect unwanted conditions that can be harmful for organisms. In this
   study, are valued open hardware and artificial intelligence as
   alternative platforms to develop new monitoring systems. The proposed
   system automatically records the physicochemical variables of the water
   (dissolved oxygen, temperature and pH) and processes them using fuzzy
   logic (artificial intelligence) for the determination of the water
   quality index. The system was tested in a shrimp culture (Litopenaeus
   vannamei) with a size of 1.67 +/- 0.23g in a period of 84 days. The
   results show that the system analyzes the physicochemical variables most
   important of a shrimp culture and were able to qualify as a water
   quality index: poor, good and excellent according to the optimal
   thresholds required by the crop. This indicates that it is possible the
   use of the open hardware and fuzzy logic system for the monitoring of
   water quality index and its application in aquaculture.}},

Title = {{An Open Framework for Participatory PM2.5 Monitoring in Smart Cities}},

Pages = {{14441-14454}},
Abstract = {{As the population in cities continues to increase rapidly, air pollution
   becomes a serious issue from public health to social economy. Among all
   pollutants, fine particulate matters (PM2.5) directly related to various
   serious health concerns, e.g., lung cancer, premature death, asthma, and
   cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. To enhance the quality of urban
   living, sensors are deployed to create smart cities. In this paper, we
   present a participatory urban sensing framework for PM2.5 monitoring
   with more than 2500 devices deployed in Taiwan and 29 other countries.
   It is one of the largest deployment project for PM2.5 monitor in the
   world as we know until May 2017. The key feature of the framework is its
   open system architecture, which is based on the principles of open
   hardware, open source software, and open data. To facilitate the
   deployment of the framework, we investigate the accuracy issue of
   low-cost particle sensors with a comprehensive set of comparison
   evaluations to identify the most reliable sensor. By working closely
   with government authorities, industry partners, and maker communities,
   we can construct an effective eco-system for participatory urban sensing
   of PM2.5 particles. Based on our deployment achievements to date, we
   provide a number of data services to improve environmental awareness,
   trigger on-demand responses, and assist future government policymaking.
   The proposed framework is highly scalable and sustainable with the
   potential to facilitate the Internet of Things, smart cities, and
   citizen science in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Infrastructure monitoring applications currently lack a cost-effective
   and reliable solution for supporting the last communication hop for
   low-power devices. The use of cellular infrastructure requires contracts
   and complex radios that are often too power hungry and cost prohibitive
   for sensing applications that require just a few bits of data each day.
   New low-power, sub-GHz, long-range radios are an ideal technology to
   help fill this communication void by providing access points that are
   able to cover multiple kilometers of urban space with thousands of
   end-point devices. These new Low-Power WideArea Networking (LPWAN)
   platforms provide a cost-effective and highly deployable option that
   could piggyback off of existing public and private wireless networks
   (WiFi, Cellular, etc). In this paper, we present OpenChirp, a prototype
   end-toend LPWAN architecture built using LoRa Wide-Area Network
   (LoRaWAN) with the goal of simplifying the design and deployment of
   Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices across wide areas like campuses and
   cities. We present a software architecture that exposes an application
   layer allowing users to register devices, describe transducer
   properties, transfer data and retrieve historical values. We define a
   service model on top of LoRaWAN that acts as a session layer to provide
   basic encoding and syntax to raw data streams. At the device-level, we
   introduce and benchmark an open-source hardware platform that uses
   Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) to help provision LoRa clients that can be
   extended with custom transducers. We evaluate the system in terms of
   end-node energy consumption, radio penetration into buildings as well as
   coverage provided by a network currently deployed at Carnegie Mellon
   University.}},

   designed and implemented. These quality attribute scenarios are the
   equivalent of UML scenarios and use-cases. They are built specifically
   to document the nonfunctional requirements and use a quality scenario
   template.}},

Abstract = {{In pursuit of coping mechanisms for the challenges of sustainable
   manufacturing, systematic methods have been developed to allow engineers
   to improve the ratio between products' utility and environmental impact.
   These necessary efforts remain however limited if the surrounding

   potential approach for unlocking the limits of existing sustainable
   product design practices and to lead towards alternative and
   eco-efficient production and consumption practices termed as
   participative production. First, it discusses the potential advantages
   of this emerging practice in terms of environmental sustainability.
   Second, it provides a screened qualitative environmental analysis of 18
   exemplary open source hardware products. Specific sustainable design
   principles implemented by these products are highlighted and discussed
   in order to identify challenges for further common research in the field

Abstract = {{With the rapid growth of a number of elderly people around the world, an
   increasing need has arisen in providing physical security to them.
   Researchers have been working in developing such monitoring systems for
   the past decades. However, the needs of elderly people and their
   families are yet to be fulfilled, especially since the developed
   existing systems need their users to change their lifestyles. This work
   aims at suggesting a system for monitoring the occupancy of an elderly
   person on the bed. Capacitive proximity sensing system has been proven
   to be a probable solution for indoor localization, which senses the
   presence of a human body. Nevertheless, the requirements for
   installation are many, which make the integration costly. In this paper,
   a flexible and integrated solution is proposed that makes use of
   inexpensive, open source hardware, allowing indoor localization and fall
   detection. The bed monitoring system is made up of aluminum sheets
   sensor electrodes installed under the bed sheets to detect the sleeping
   patterns of the subject. An alarm system has been integrated into the
   room to enable the elderly to call for help during an emergency.
   Presence detector and light controlling device are installed on the
   floor surface to detect the mobility of the elderly and turn ON/OFF the
   room lights automatically. The proposed system allows elderly people to
   live independent living at homes with all amenities.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the subject of embedded systems education in the Arduino
   age is examined. Arduino is an open-source microcontroller platform that
   has been widely popular in the past decade among hobbyists and
   academics. Arduino is increasingly being adopted in courses that span
   different disciplines in schools and universities. As a result, numerous
   papers are being published every year in different engineering education
   conferences and journals reporting the integration of Arduino in
   teaching. In this work, the impact of Arduino on embedded systems
   education is investigated. First, challenges facing embedded systems
   education are identified from the literature. Second, different Arduino
   teaching integration methodologies reported in the literature are
   surveyed and analyzed. Third, the question whether Arduino successfully
   addresses embedded education challenges or not is discussed taking both
   surveyed findings and recent market trends into consideration. Finally,
   a number of openended research directions are proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Microprocessor (uP) Architecture and Programming constitute core courses
   in computer science and electronic engineering departments. A variety of
   tools has been used for gaining more knowledge and understanding the
   basic and advanced concepts of the course. These tools (hardware
   platforms and simulators) are focused mainly on assembly programming.
   Despite the existing tools, students still face great learning
   difficulties. On the other hand, key issues are the corresponding
   architecture and the programming features of the uP under studying. The
   above issues are not fully addressed by the existing tools. In this
   paper, a customizable hardware based uP simulator is presented and final
   proposed. Using this simulator, an experimental hypothetical educational
   uP can be built by students and the professors can create the
   corresponding learning scenarios. Based on the proposed approach, the
   experimental uP consists of identical hardware based blocks that can be
   reprogrammed for representing registers, arithmetic and logic unit, etc.
   Thus, the students can act now as uP architecture and assembly language
   designers gaining crucial knowledge in the field.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, many internet of things (IoT) platforms based on cloud
   computing have been proposed for general purpose applications. Though
   many similar platforms or schemes particular for smart home applications
   have been proposed, many issues such as multiple connectivity due to
   diversity of smart home applications and supporting for real-time
   operations have not been solved properly. We propose a smart home
   foundation scheme adopting open source hardware devices and cloud
   computing technology to explore these issues. In this scheme, Arduino
   Yun-based smart hardware devices can connect to the cloud server through
   multiply network connectivity. By utilising Spacebrew technology, a
   bidirectional real-time communication can be implemented which provides
   a solid foundation for real-time operations of smart home. The core
   functions of the scheme are exposed through RESTful web services in a
   SaaS (short for software as a service) manner and can be called by
   various clients and other applications. Demonstrative applications show
   that the proposed smart home foundation scheme provides adequate support
   for creating smart home applications based on wireless open source
   hardware devices.}},

   Hardware}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Pages = {{11118-11130}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a light-weight rapid control prototyping (RCP)
   system based on off-the-shelf open source hardware to achieve high
   performance computing, cost effectiveness, portability, and easy
   accessiblity. The proposed RCP system consists of a PC-based
   computer-aided control system design (CACSD) tool for computing control
   action and tiny palm-sized open source hardware for input and output
   (I/O) operation and data transfer through a built-in high-speed USB
   interface. The popular-priced and portable open source hardware is used
   as a bridge between CACSD tools and real plants to deliver the control
   and sensor data at the sampling time points. Ten I/O function blocks
   written in C code are developed based on the CACSD tool employed for the
   proposed light-weight RCP system in order to handle I/O operation in a
   simple way. In addition, we suggest two practical strategies, a batch
   transfer strategy and a variable sampling period method, to increase the
   sampling rate of the control system. It is shown through experiment that
   the proposed light-weight RCP system works well up to a sampling rate of
   2 kHz without adopting expensive hardware and C code generators. It is
   expected that the proposed RCP system will be considered as affordable
   and readily available to schools for mass education.}},

   smart eyewear}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PERVASIVE COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{41-61}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Smart eyewear, such as augmented or virtual reality headset,
   allows the projection of virtual content through a display worn on the
   user's head. This paper aims to present a mobile platform, named
   ``CARTON{''}, which transforms a smartphone into smart eyewear,
   following a do-it-yourself (DIY) approach. This platform is composed of
   three main components: a blueprint to build the hardware prototype with
   very simple materials and regular tools; a software development kit
   (SDK) to help with the development of new applications (e.g. augmented
   reality app); and, finally, a second SDK (ControlWear) to interact with
   mobile applications through a Smartwatch.
   Design/methodology/approach - User experiments were conducted, in which
   participants were asked to create, by themselves, the CARTON's hardware
   part and perform usability tests with their own creation. A second round
   of experimentation was conducted to evaluate three different interaction
   modalities.
   Findings - Qualitative user feedback and quantitative results prove that
   CARTON is functional and feasible to anyone, without specific skills.
   The results also showed that ControlWear had the most positive results,
   compared with the other interaction modalities, and that user
   interaction preference would vary depending on the task.
   Originality/value - The authors describe a novel way to create a smart
   eyewear available for a wide audience around the world. By providing
   everything open-source and open-hardware, they intend to solve the
   reachability of technologies related to smart eyewear and aim to
   accelerate research around it.}},

Abstract = {{This paper elucidates the design and implementation of a low-cost
   wireless intelligent two hand gesture recognition system. The proposed
   system consists of a primary and secondary sub-system which work in
   tandem to recognize static gestures signed by the user. Each of the
   sub-systems consists of a sensory glove, embedded with custom made,
   low-cost flex and contact sensors interfaced with a ATMega328
   microcontroller. The two sub-systems are wirelessly inter-connected
   through a pair of TI's CC2541 Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) modules. The
   system recognizes gestures with the help of a Dual-mode Intelligent
   Agent (DIA) which operates in Identification Mode (IM) and intelligently
   switches to Enhanced Identification Mode (EIM) when the gesture fails to
   get recognized in IM. The EIM incorporates a Bit Stream Error
   Elimination (BSEE) algorithm which enhances the gesture recognition
   accuracy without the addition of any external hardware. The performance
   of the system was evaluated using a data set comprising of 196 static
   gestures from eight globally used sign languages. The system efficiency
   was found to be 80.06\% in IM and was enhanced to 93.16\% in EIM. The
   cost of the proposed system in prototype stage is USD 22, which the
   authors believe could be realized at under USD 10 on commercialization.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study code clones in hardware description languages
   (HDLs) in comparison with general programming languages. For this
   purpose, we have developed a method for detecting code clones in Verilog
   HDL. A key idea of the proposed method is to convert the Verilog HDL
   code into the pseudo C++ code, which is then processed by an existing
   code clone detector for C++. We conducted an experiment on 10 open
   source hardware products described in Verilog HDL, where we succeeded in
   detecting nearly 1,800 clone sets with approximately 80\% precision. We
   compared code clones in Verilog HDL with those in Java/C based on the
   metrics to identify the differences among languages. We identified
   patterns on how code clones are created in Verilog HDL, which include
   cases for increasing stability and capability of parallel processing of
   the circuit.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a solution for the
   levelling plate of fused deposition modelling (FDM) additive
   manufacturing (AM) systems. This automatic levelling system is presented
   as an evolution of actual systems, which uses a new ultrasound sensing
   system.
   Design/methodology/approach - After obtaining a prototype, different
   tests were conducted for getting a system which solves the level plate
   problem and can be mounted in any FDM AM machine. Several benchmark
   models were obtained and compared with current equipment concepts for
   the validity of the product.
   Findings - All tests were performed with high accuracy, enabling the
   production of geometries that could not have been achieved without this
   novel system.
   Practical implications - This development will enable experienced users
   to set aside the problems of calibration and focus on the purpose of
   this type of machines, making prototypes.
   Originality/value - A system architecture has been developed and
   integrated into an open hardware AM system, allowing real-time
   adjustment of the plate during each layer, thus eliminating the need of
   levelling the plate, allowing to achieve easier printing, and without
   increasing the cost significantly.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to develop a low cost open source Controller
   Area Network system that simulates electronic controls in modern
   automotive vehicles and to evaluate its effectiveness as a teaching aid.
   The Arduino UNO microcontroller hoard was chosen as the desired hardware
   platform and the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) using
   the Arduino compiler was chosen as the software development environment.
   Both the Arduino Uno and Arduino IDE/compiler are open source and freely
   available to students and staff with no proprietary intellectual
   property costs.
   The Arduino UNO was interfaced with the Arduino Controller Area Network
   Bus (CANBus) shield which is also open hardware. Unitec Institute of
   Technology practices a holistic approach to teaching. As part of its
   holistic approach to teaching, senior students are encouraged to develop
   technical artefacts that can be used as teaching aids for junior
   students, the junior students are introduced to the artefact as part of
   their course and the artefact is used to encourage junior students to
   increase their technical proficiency so that when they reach a senior
   technical level they can develop artefacts too. The holistic approach is
   considered to he self-sustaining and provides positive role modelling
   for junior students. The project described in this paper was developed
   by a senior student and has been used as a teaching aid for junior
   students congruent with the holistic teaching philosophy practiced at
   Unitec. The code and circuitry was designed by an exchange Masters
   student and was used in the papers, APTE 7504 Vehicle Electronic
   Diagnostics and APTE 6505 Automotive Electronics, to help students
   understand CANBus operation and design features in an Automotive CANBus
   application.}},

Abstract = {{A low-cost, low power consumption indoor environment monitoring
   instrument, called SKOMOBO (school monitoring box), was developed and
   tested. SKOMOBO includes sensors to monitor temperature/relative

   was developed using the open source hardware Arduino Pro Mini. This
   paper describes the process of building SKOMOBO, including sensor
   selection, printed circuit board design, sensor programming and
   performance evaluation. Two co-located tests have been undertaken; one
   in the controlled environment and one in the uncontrolled environment.
   Results show SKOMOBO measurements have high correlations with their
   commercial equivalents. In the two different testing environments, the
   R-2 of temperature measurements for all six SKOMOBOs were 1. The R-2 for
   relative humidity and CO2 measurements were above 0.9. The result of
   this work shows the reliability of SKOMOBO on monitoring indoor air
   quality.}},

Abstract = {{Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are increasingly
   becoming integral parts of many non-electrical fields of engineering,
   e.g., Precision Agriculture, Avionics, Bionics, Civionics, and so on.
   Modern mechanical engineering is nearly synonymous with Mechatronics,
   and more recently Mechaphonics, viz., study of mechanical systems
   controlled by mobile phone apps, has become popular. Pneumatics, or
   compressed air, and hydraulics are niche areas of mechanical engineering
   with many industrial and other applications, and their performance is
   enhanced by incorporating electronic hardware and computer software.
   Many of these systems are also good examples of so-called smart products
   and Internet of Things. In this paper, an affordable build-your-own
   (BYO) computer control system is designed and developed for hands-on
   instruction in electro-pneumatics education. Results of implementation
   of a proof-of-concept prototype system using low-cost components, open
   source hardware and free open source software, are presented to
   illustrate the practical utility of the proposed system.}},

Abstract = {{Prosopis juliflora is a small weed tree, native to Central and South
   America, and the Caribbean, which has become a major invasive weed in
   Asia, including India, Latin America, Africa and Australia. It has major
   detrimental impact on scarce, underground water resources, takes over
   the local flora ecosystems and affects the soil environment. Manual
   removal of saplings is time-consuming and expensive. Presently, the
   removal of the weed is performed manually which is time-consuming, or
   using very expensive commercial heavy equipment. In this paper, an
   affordable and innovative unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) unmanned ground
   vehicle (UGV) system is designed and developed for autonomous
   identification and removal of the weed seedlings and saplings. Results

Abstract = {{This paper presents a solution for different activities concerning
   shrimp farming, especially focused on the middle-class artisanal
   productive sector, using both open source hardware and open source

   farming, measuring parameters, such as dissolved oxygen, water
   temperature and food levels inside reservoirs, in order to have a
   real-time reading of parameters. In case critical values appear, an
   alarm activates by control center, notifying by either electronic mail
   or web interface. The attractiveness of the proposal consists in the
   automation of the feeding system, which provides food supply to shrimps
   at certain daily periods, controlling by web interface the different
   options the breeder has available, a process that can be even managed

Abstract = {{This paper presents a case study on emerging challenges within
   collaborative innovation projects engaging open communities. Innovation
   driven by open communities has proven to have a significant potential,
   in particular for open source software. However, tools and methodologies

   communities, in the perspective of creating open hardware to solve
   societal issues, remains at the early stages. This paper seeks to
   pinpoint the potentialities and challenges of such projects toward
   defining methods to better support a multi-stakeholders open source
   collaboration context. The experimental field of this research concerns
   the smart electricity distribution, and more precisely a public driven
   project of the diffusion of smart-meters in France and their
   appropriation by open source communities, with the involvement of the
   university and a public industrial company. The project seeks to study
   how these communities of users develop in a collaborative manner, new
   products and services using the smart-meter as a support technology. The
   first results show that the open community makes natural connection on
   specific environments such as Smart buildings to materialize usages of
   smart meters.}},

   Spectrally Dependent Differences in Photochemical Efficiency and
   Functional Absorption Cross Section within the Dinoflagellate
   Symbiodinium spp.}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE}},

Abstract = {{Active chlorophyll a fluorescence is an essential tool for understanding
   photosynthetic activity within cnidarian/dinoflagellate symbioses.
   Fluorescence measurement is typically achieved by utilizing a blue or
   red monochromatic excitation light source. However, algal photosynthetic
   pigments can differ in their absorption spectra, potentially leading to
   excitation wavelength dependent measurements of maximal and light
   acclimated PSII photosynthetic quantum yield (Fv/Fm or Fq'/Fm') and
   functional absorption cross section (sigma(PSII) or sigma(PSII)). Here
   we utilized an open source hardware development platform to construct a
   multispectral excitation fluorometer to assess spectrally dependent
   differences in photochemistry within four different Symbiodinium species
   (two of each ITS2-type A4 and B1). Multivariate analysis of light
   acclimated photochemical signatures showed separation between most alga
   types. These spectrally dependent differences in light acclimated PSII
   efficiency and PSII functional absorption cross section likely reflect
   changes in light harvesting compounds, their connectivity to the PSII
   reaction centers and the balance between photochemical and
   non-photochemical fluorescence quenching. Additionally, acclimation to
   low (20 iLmol photons M-2 s(-1)) and high (200 mu mol photons m(-2)
   s(-1)) light conditions was examined in two of these symbionts types
   (ITS-2 type A4 and B1) As expected, chlorophyll a cell(-1) decreased
   under high light acclimation in both symbionts. However, only A4 saw a
   subsequent reduction in absorbance whereas cellular volume decreased in
   the B1 (S. minutum) symbiont. In response to high light acclimation,
   Fv/Fm was significantly lower at all excitation wavelengths for the B1
   symbiont where as efficiencies remained the same for A4. However,
   high-light acclimated Fq'/Fm' levels decreased in both symbionts, but
   only when measured using the 615 or 625 nm excitation wavelengths.
   Non-photochemical quenching within the antennae bed was downregulated
   under high light acclimation in the A4 symbiont, but only when measured
   using the 505 and 530 nm excitation wavelengths. Such changes in Fq'/Fm'
   and antennae bed quenching highlight the benefits of spectrally resolved
   photochemical measurements. Additionally, the utilization of Arduino and
   Bitscope hardware exemplifies the potential of open source development
   platforms for construction of highly customizable instrumentation for
   photosynthetic research.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs) have been large, complex
   and expensive. Development of UUVs has been driven by defense and
   commercial requirements. This has allowed for extensive research and
   development budgets and long development cycles. This paper briefly
   discuses these historic drivers and how this situation has changed. It
   focuses on a new compact affordable UUV.
   In 2015, several veterans of the conventional UUV sector set out to
   change the dynamics of the industry, founding Riptide Autonomous
   Solutions. Riptide's first offering was the micro-UUV, a new, highly
   flexible, open source autonomous undersea vehicle. The micro-UUV
   features open hardware and software interfaces giving users a reliable
   and robust platform to advance technology development. The vehicle
   design is optimized for high efficiency with the best hydrodynamic
   signature in its class. The base micro-UUV is 4 7/8 inches in diameter,
   40 inches in length and weighs 22 lbs. The standard system is rated to a
   depth of 300 meters.
   This paper discuses the technical details of this UUV that make it
   distinctive and enabled its rapid development. The entire system was
   taken from design to initial delivery in under 12 months. Flexible and
   open software interfaces and use of modern three dimensional design and
   printing are key enablers of the rapid development. A highly optimized
   hydrodynamic design improves the speed and endurance of the vehicle, as
   does its compact size. Reducing control fins from the typical four to
   three reduces drag and enables active roll control steering, a further
   enhancement of the micro-UUV's performance. In addition to describing
   the novel features and approach of the micro-UUV design this paper will
   discuss the potential for a new aluminum seawater battery to extend the
   range of this compact vehicle to nearly 1000km.}},

   the system is capable of implementing automatic control of the air
   conditioner equipment. Through a central command unit, it is possible to
   configure timers to turn on and off all devices connected to the
   network. The system also adds intelligence to conventional equipment by
   making use of a motion sensor, avoiding electricity waste. An automatic
   temperature control is implemented through sensors that monitor external
   conditions. By making use of a mesh network based on DigiMesh protocol,
   each device acts like a router, increasing network range and making it
   easier to add or remove new devices. The proposed system was validated

Abstract = {{In this paper, a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) solution is proposed for
   soil's condition measurement to monitor oil palm plantations (PalmNET)
   according to agricultural meteorological practices. The PalmNET
   monitoring system is composed by a WSN used for in-field soil's
   condition measurement and a web-server interface for data visualization.
   PalmNET can automatically collect soil moisture data and transmit field
   data through a ZigBee network to a web-server. The PalmNET
   proof-of-concept is a WSN built upon open-source hardware and software,
   which includes two sensor nodes, a sink and a Gateway with a GPRS
   module. The WSN was deployed in Palmar de la Vizcaina Experimental Field
   Station having the following proof of concept objectives: (i) collect
   and centralize soil moisture data and (ii) post data to a web
   application interface. Results have revealed PalmNET as a feasible,
   automated and solar powered application for oil palm plantations in
   Colombia.}},

Abstract = {{The bending stiffness of the wind turbine blades has decreased due to
   the trend of wind turbine upsizing. Consequently, the risk of blades
   breakage by hitting the tower has increased. In order to prevent such
   incidents, this study proposes a deflection monitoring system that can
   be installed to already operating wind turbine's blades. The monitoring
   system is composed of an estimation algorithm to detect blade deflection
   and a wireless sensor network as a hardware equipment. As for the
   estimation method for blade deflection, a strain-based estimation
   algorithm and an objective function for optimal sensor arrangement are
   proposed. Strain-based estimation algorithm is using a linear
   correlation between strain and deflections, which can be expressed in a
   form of a transformation matrix. The objective function includes the
   terms of strain sensitivity and condition number of the transformation
   matrix between strain and deflection. In order to calculate the
   objective function, a simplified experimental model of the blade is
   constructed by interpolating the mode shape of a blade from modal
   testing. The interpolation method is effective considering a practical
   use to operating wind turbines' blades since it is not necessary to
   establish a finite element model of a blade. On the other hand, a sensor
   network with wireless connection with an open source hardware is
   developed. It is installed to a 300 W scale wind turbine and vibration
   of the blade on operation is investigated. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper reviews a new real-time measurement instrument dedicated for
   online neutron monitoring with fission chambers in nuclear reactors. The
   instrument implements the higher order Campbelling methods and
   self-monitoring capabilities on an open source development board. The
   board includes an CPU/FPGA System on a Chip.
   The feasibility of the measurement instrument was tested both in
   laboratory with a signal generator and in the Minerve reactor. It is
   shown that the instrument provides reliable and robust count rate
   estimation over a wide reactor power range based on the third order
   statistics of the fission chamber signal. In addition, the system is
   able to identify whether the measured count rate change is due to the
   malfunction of the detector or due to the change in the neutron flux.
   The applied self-monitoring method is based on the spectral properties
   of the fission chamber signal. During the experimental verification, the
   considered malfunction was the change of the polarization voltage. (C)

Abstract = {{Sustainability of irrigation practices is an important objective to be
   pursued in many countries, especially in regions where water scarcity
   causes strong conflicts among different water uses. The efficient use of
   irrigation water is a key factor in coping with the food demands of an
   increasing world population and with the negative effects of climate
   change on water resource availability in many areas. In this complex
   context, it is important that farmers can rely on instruments and
   practices that enable a better management of water at the field scale,
   whatever the irrigation method they adopt.
   In this paper, we present an open-hardware device based on the Arduino
   technology that was developed to allow the continuous monitoring of soil
   water potential in the root zone for supporting irrigation scheduling at
   the field scale. The structure of the device is flexible and can be
   adapted to host different types of sensors. The results, obtained
   managing irrigation in a peach orchard, show that adoption of the
   device, together with a simple irrigation scheduling criterion, allowed
   a significant increase of water use efficiency without causing a
   reduction of the quantity and quality of crop production. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{An in-house solution for the verification of dose delivered to a moving
   phantom as required for the clinical implementation of lung stereotactic
   ablative body radiation therapy was developed. The superior-inferior
   movement required to simulate tumour motion during a normal breathing
   cycle was achieved via the novel use of an Arduino Uno (TM), a low-cost
   open-source microcontroller board connected to a high torque servo
   motor. Slow CT imaging was used to acquire the image set and a 4D cone
   beam CT (4D-CBCT) verified the efficacy of contoured margins before
   treatment on the moving phantom. Treatment fields were delivered to a
   section of a CIRS (TM) anthropomorphic phantom. Dose verification to the
   dynamic phantom with Gafchromic EBT3 film using 3 \%-1 mm gamma analysis
   acceptance criteria registered an absolute dose pass rate for IMRT and
   VMAT of 98 and 96.6 \%, respectively. It was verified that 100 \% of the
   PTV received the prescribed dose of 12 Gy per fraction using the dynamic
   phantom, and no major discrepancy between planned and measured results
   due to interplay between multileaf collimator sequences and target
   motion was observed. This study confirmed that the use of an in-house
   solution using open source hardware and software with existing quality
   assurance equipment was appropriate in validating a new treatment

   low-cost, open hardware and software platform that ensures users can
   always recover and reprogram wireless sensors, in spite of software
   errors. Shoulder angel uses a physically separate coprocessor to monitor
   a device's power consumption and other behaviors, while keeping the
   device in a reprogrammable state. Our results show that shoulder angel
   is able to recover from otherwise fatal software errors while incurring

Abstract = {{In optogenetics, researchers use light and genetically encoded
   photoreceptors to control biological processes with unmatched precision.
   However, outside of neuroscience, the impact of optogenetics has been
   limited by a lack of user-friendly, flexible, accessible hardware. Here,
   we engineer the Light Plate Apparatus (LPA), a device that can deliver
   two independent 310 to 1550 nm light signals to each well of a 24-well
   plate with intensity control over three orders of magnitude and
   millisecond resolution. Signals are programmed using an intuitive web
   tool named Iris. All components can be purchased for under \$400 and the
   device can be assembled and calibrated by a non-expert in one day. We
   use the LPA to precisely control gene expression from blue, green, and
   red light responsive optogenetic tools in bacteria, yeast, and mammalian
   cells and simplify the entrainment of cyanobacterial circadian rhythm.
   The LPA dramatically reduces the entry barrier to optogenetics and
   photobiology experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Today, maker culture as an extension of DIY culture is rapidly spreading
   in the world with the advent of open source hardware. Makers currently
   learn and use practical skills based on different reference designs that
   are available to makers through the Internet. However, Reference design
   of SMAs for makers is not provided sufficiently despite commercial
   applications for shape memory alloys (SMAs) in different industrial
   fields. The objective of this research was to develop reference design
   for actuators based on SMA wires so that makers could easily and quickly
   utilize and learn. This research began by exploring different cases of
   actuators based on SMA wires. Through these case studies, we extracted
   essential parameters and classified cases into the essential parameters
   in order to develop reference design for actuators based on SMA wires.
   In order to prove the validity of reference design developed in this
   research, this reference design was subjected to experiments and tested.}},

   industry requirements in both contents and methodology, the course
   develops capabilities and competencies in problem solving, independent
   learning, teamwork, and technical knowledge. Since PBL methodology alone
   does not ensure teamwork, it was complemented with CL. Design review
   meetings (as described in IEC 61160), deliverables, and organizational
   resources were also introduced to mirror industry demands. This
   structure integrated course content and student academic achievement in
   a simulated industrial environment. The course had students build a
   modular management system for home appliances, implementing control
   software on the ``Arduino{''} open-source platform, as well as using
   wireless communications. The results show that teaching, learning, and
   student assessment processes can be improved by using PBL with CL. In
   addition, the introduction of industry practices, such us peer review

Abstract = {{Marine processes are observed with sensors from both the ground and
   space over large spatio-temporal scales. Citizen-based contributions can
   fill observational gaps and increase environmental stewardship amongst
   the public. For this purpose, tools and methods for citizen science need
   to (1) complement existing datasets; and (2) be affordable, while
   appealing to different user and developer groups. In this article, tools
   and methods developed in the 7th Framework Programme of European Union
   (EU FP 7) funded project Citclops (citizens' observatories for coast and
   ocean optical monitoring) are reviewed. Tools range from a stand-alone
   smartphone app to devices with Arduino and 3-D printing, and hence are
   attractive to a diversity of users; from the general public to more
   specified maker-and open labware movements. Standardization to common
   water quality parameters and methods allows long-term storage in regular
   marine data repositories, such as SeaDataNet and EMODnet, thereby
   providing open data access. Due to the given intercomparability to
   existing remote sensing datasets, these tools are ready to complement
   the marine datapool. In the future, such combined satellite and citizen
   observations may set measurements by the engaged public in a larger
   context and hence increase their individual meaning. In a wider sense, a
   synoptic use can support research, management authorities, and societies
   at large.}},

Abstract = {{There are currently no standardized objective measures to assess beer
   quality based on the most significant parameters related to the first
   impression from consumers, which are visual characteristics of
   foamability, beer color and bubble size. This study describes the
   development of an affordable and robust robotic beer pourer using
   low-cost sensors, Arduino (R) boards, Lego (R) building blocks and servo
   motors for prototyping. The RoboBEER is also coupled with video capture
   capabilities (iPhone 5S) and automated post hoc computer vision analysis
   algorithms to assess different parameters based on foamability, bubble
   size, alcohol content, temperature, carbon dioxide release and beer
   color. Results have shown that parameters obtained from different beers
   by only using the RoboBEER can be used for their classification
   according to quality and fermentation type. Results were compared to
   sensory analysis techniques using principal component analysis (PCA) and
   artificial neural networks (ANN) techniques. The PCA from RoboBEER data
   explained 73\% of variability within the data. From sensory analysis,
   the PCA explained 67\% of the variability and combining RoboBEER and
   Sensory data, the PCA explained only 59\% of data variability. The ANN
   technique for pattern recognition allowed creating a classification
   model from the parameters obtained with RoboBEER, achieving 92.4\%
   accuracy in the classification according to quality and fermentation
   type, which is consistent with the PCA results using data only from
   RoboBEER. The repeatability and objectivity of beer assessment offered
   by the RoboBEER could translate into the development of an important
   practical tool for food scientists, consumers and retail companies to
   determine differences within beers based on the specific parameters
   studied. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Microbial water quality monitoring for the presence of faecal indicator
   bacteria (FIB) is a mandatory activity in many countries and is key in
   public health protection. Despite technological advances and a need for
   methodological improvements, chromogenic and fluorogenic enzymatic
   techniques remain the mainstays of water quality monitoring for both
   public health agencies and regulated utilities. We demonstrated that
   bioelectroanalytical approaches to FIB enumeration are possible and can
   be achieved using commercially available enzyme-specific resorufin
   glycosides, although these are expensive, not widely available or
   designed for purpose. Following this, we designed two naphthoquinone
   glycosides which performed better, achieving Escherichia coli detection
   in the range 5.0x10(2) to 5.0x10(5) CFUml(-1) 22-54\% quicker than
   commercially available resorufin glycosides. The molecular design of the
   naphthoquinone glycosides requires fewer synthetic steps allowing them
   to be produced for as little as US\$50 per kg. Tests with environmental
   samples demonstrated the low tendency for abiotic interference and that,
   despite specificity being maintained between -glucuronidase and
   -galactosidase, accurate enumeration of E.coli in environmental samples
   necessitates development of a selective medium. In comparison to a
   commercially available detection method, which has U.S. Environmental
   Protection Agency (EPA) approval, our approach performed better at high
   organism concentrations, detecting 500 organisms in 9h compared with
   13.5h for the commercial method. Bioelectroanalytical detection is
   comparable to current approved methods and with further development
   could result in improved detection times. A recent trend for low-cost
   open-source hardware means that automated, potentiostatically controlled
   E.coli detection systems could be constructed for less than US\$100 per
   channel.}},

Abstract = {{Open-source technology not only has facilitated the expansion of the
   greater research community, but by lowering costs it has encouraged
   innovation and customizable design. The field of automated microscopy
   has continued to be a challenge in accessibility due the expense and
   inflexible, noninterchangeable stages. This paper presents a low-cost,
   open-source microscope 3-D stage. A RepRap 3-D printer was converted to
   an optical microscope equipped with a customized, 3-D printed holder for
   a USB microscope. Precision measurements were determined to have an
   average error of 10 m at the maximum speed and 27 m at the minimum
   recorded speed. Accuracy tests yielded an error of 0.15\%. The machine
   is a true 3-D stage and thus able to operate with USB microscopes or
   conventional desktop microscopes. It is larger than all commercial
   alternatives, and is thus capable of high-depth images over
   unprecedented areas and complex geometries. The repeatability is below
   2-D microscope stages, but testing shows that it is adequate for the
   majority of scientific applications. The open-source microscope stage
   costs less than 3-9\% of the closest proprietary commercial stages. This
   extreme affordability vastly improves accessibility for 3-D microscopy
   throughout the world.
   Lay description The concept of open-source technology stems from the
   developmental model of accessibility and ease of use, enabling an
   environment of continual improvement and open communication. This
   approach has the potential to dramatically change many fields of study
   including that of microscope use in research settings. Automated
   microscopy is often a challenging and inaccessible field due to the cost
   and non-interchangeable stages, the flat plate on which samples are
   placed for analysis. This paper presents a low-cost, open source
   microscope 3-D stage. A RepRap 3-D printer was converted to an optical
   microscope equipped with a customized, 3-D printed holder for a USB
   microscope. Precision measurements were determined to have an average
   error of 10 ?m at the maximum speed and 27 ?m at the minimum recorded
   speed. Accuracy tests yielded an error of 0.15\%. The machine is a true
   3-D stage and thus able to operate with USB microscopes or conventional
   desktop microscopes. Because it is larger than all current commercial
   alternative systems, it is capable of high depth images over
   unprecedented areas and complex geometries. The repeatibility is below
   2-D microscope stages, but testing shows that it is adequate for the
   majority of scientific applications. The open source microscope stage
   costs less than 3\% to 9\% of the closest proprietary commercial stages.
   This extreme affordability vastly improves accessibility for 3-D
   microscopy throughout the world.}},

Abstract = {{Nearly every practical improvement in modeling human motion is well
   founded in a properly designed collection of data or datasets. These
   datasets must be made publicly available for the community could
   validate and accept them. It is reasonable to concede that a collective,
   guided enterprise could serve to devise solid and substantial datasets,
   as a result of a collaborative effort, in the same sense as the open
   software community does. In this way datasets could be complemented,
   extended and expanded in size with, for example, more individuals,
   samples and human actions. For this to be possible some commitments must
   be made by the collaborators, being one of them sharing the same data
   acquisition platform. In this paper, we offer an affordable open source
   hardware and software platform based on inertial wearable sensors in a
   way that several groups could cooperate in the construction of datasets
   through common software suitable for collaboration. Some experimental
   results about the throughput of the overall system are reported showing
   the feasibility of acquiring data from up to 6 sensors with a sampling
   frequency no less than 118 Hz. Also, a proof-of-concept dataset is
   provided comprising sampled data from 12 subjects suitable for gait
   analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{3D Printing PDMS Elastomer in a Hydrophilic Support Bath via Freeform
   Reversible Embedding}},
Journal = {{ACS BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE \& ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1781-1786}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer is used in a wide range of
   biomaterial applications including microfluidics, cell culture
   substrates, flexible electronics, and medical devices. However, it has
   proved challenging to 3D print PDMS in complex structures due to its low
   elastic modulus and need for support during the printing process. Here
   we demonstrate the 3D printing of hydrophobic PDMS prepolymer resins
   within a hydrophilic Carbopol gel support via freeform reversible
   embedding (FRE). In the FRE printing process, the Carbopol support acts
   as a Bingham plastic that yields and fluidizes when the syringe tip of
   the 3D printer moves through it, but acts as a solid for the PDMS
   extruded within it. This, in combination with the immiscibility of
   hydrophobic PDMS in the hydrophilic Carbopol, confines the PDMS
   prepolymer within the support for curing times up to 72 h while
   maintaining dimensional stability. After printing and curing, the
   Carbopol support gel releases the embedded PDMS prints by using
   phosphate buffered saline solution to reduce the Carbopol yield stress.
   As proof-of-concept, we used Sylgard 184 PDMS to 3D print linear and
   helical filaments via continuous extrusion and cylindrical and helical
   tubes via layer-by-layer fabrication. Importantly, we show that the 3D
   printed tubes were manifold and perfusable. The results demonstrate that
   hydrophobic polymers with low viscosity and long cure times can be 3D
   printed using a hydrophilic support, expanding the range of biomaterials
   that can be used in additive manufacturing. Further, by implementing the
   technology using low cost open-source hardware and software tools, the
   FRE printing technique can be rapidly implemented for research
   applications.}},

   medical instrumentation, soft robotics, microscopy, flexible electronics

   process {[}1] for the fabrication of a `pop-up' flexure-based mesoscale
   system that exploits the simplicity of 2-D manufacturing techniques such
   as sheet-metal operations and laser cutting to realize a 3-D mechanism.
   The fabrication of a laminated Delta robot with prismatic actuation is
   presented to exemplify this process. A working device with actuation and
   functional components such as linear guides, stepper motors and limit
   switches is designed and fully realized. Because the mechanism is popped
   out of the plane to achieve its 3D shape, we present a stiffness
   analysis to arrive at the out-of-plane (or `pop-out') angles that the
   planar system must accommodate so that constraints/limits on actuator
   torque/force can be can satisfied while producing an operational system.
   The simplicity of the processes makes it a candidate for the use in the
   emerging open-source hardware technologies for fabricating low-cost,
   complex, electromechanical systems. (C) 2016 The Society of

Abstract = {{Large-scale high-throughput plant phenotyping (sometimes called
   phenomics) is becoming increasingly important in plant biology and
   agriculture and is essential to cutting-edge plant breeding and
   management approaches needed to meet the food and fuel needs for the
   next century. Currently, the application of these approaches is severely
   limited by the availability of appropriate instrumentation and by the
   ability to communicate experimental protocols, results and analyses. To
   address these issues, we have developed a low-cost, yet sophisticated
   open-source scientific instrument designed to enable communities of
   researchers, plant breeders, educators, farmers and citizen scientists
   to collect high-quality field data on a large scale. The MultispeQ
   provides measurements in the field or laboratory of both, environmental
   conditions (light intensity and quality, temperature, humidity, CO2
   levels, time and location) and useful plant phenotypes, including
   photosynthetic parameters-photosystem II quantum yield (FII),
   non-photochemical exciton quenching (NPQ), photosystem II
   photoinhibition, light-driven proton translocation and thylakoid proton
   motive force, regulation of the chloroplast ATP synthase and potentially
   many others-and leaf chlorophyll and other pigments. Plant phenotype
   data are transmitted from the MultispeQ to mobile devices, laptops or
   desktop computers together with key metadata that gets saved to the
   PhotosynQ platform (https://photosynq.org) and provides a suite of
   web-based tools for sharing, visualization, filtering, dissemination and
   analyses. We present validation experiments, comparing MultispeQ results
   with established platforms, and show that it can be usefully deployed in
   both laboratory and field settings. We present evidence that MultispeQ
   can be used by communities of researchers to rapidly measure, store and
   analyse multiple environmental and plant properties, allowing for deeper
   understanding of the complex interactions between plants and their
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{The use of lasers to weld polymer sheets provides a means of
   highly-adaptive and custom additive manufacturing for a wide array of
   industrial, medical, and end user/consumer applications. This paper
   provides an open source design for a laser polymer welding system, which
   can be fabricated with low-cost fused filament fabrication and
   off-the-shelf mechanical and electrical parts. The system is controlled
   with free and open source software and firmware. The operation of the
   machine is validated and the performance of the system is quantified for
   the mechanical properties (peak load) and weld width of linear low
   density polyethylene (LLDPE) lap welds manufactured with the system as a
   function of linear energy density. The results provide incident laser
   power and machine parameters that enable both dual (two layers) and
   multilayer (three layers while welding only two sheets) polymer welded
   systems. The application of these parameter sets provides users of the
   open source laser polymer welder with the fundamental requirements to
   produce mechanically stable LLDPE multi-layer welded products, such as
   heat exchangers.}},

Abstract = {{The advent of massively interconnected objects, devices, and sensors
   raises equally substantial challenges regarding the resources that will
   allow makers to manage the complexity of such systems and to exploit the
   opportunities such technologies open up. Simplicity in management and a
   smooth, creative integration of everyday life objects empowered by
   digital technology in our own environment are two key factors for a
   successful penetration of Internet of Things (IoT). We present UDOO IoT,
   a combined set of open hardware (UDOO Quad, Blu and Bricks) and open
   software (UAPPI, an extension of MIT App Inventor) technologies that
   allow novices from their early steps in the maker's world to create
   their own digital objects connected to the cloud, easily defining custom
   behavior logic for sensors and actuators. UDOO IoT is illustrated
   through one of the field studies carried out along its design process.}},

Abstract = {{The commercial data acquisition systems used for seismic exploration are
   usually expensive equipment. In this work, a low cost data acquisition
   system (Geophonino) has been developed for recording seismic signals
   from a vertical geophone. The signal goes first through an
   instrumentation amplifier, INA155, which is suitable for low amplitude
   signals like the seismic noise, and an anti-aliasing filter based on the
   MAX7404 switched-capacitor filter. After that, the amplified and
   filtered signal is digitized and processed by Arduino Due and registered
   in an SD memory card. Geophonino is configured for continuous
   registering, where the sampling frequency, the amplitude gain and the
   registering time are user-defined. The complete prototype is an open
   source and open hardware system. It has been tested by comparing the
   registered signals with the ones obtained through different commercial
   data recording systems and different kind of geophones. The obtained
   results show good correlation between the tested measurements,
   presenting Geophonino as a low-cost alternative system for seismic data
   recording. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The miniaturization, sophistication, proliferation, and accessibility of
   technologies are enabling the capture of more and previously
   inaccessible phenomena in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, more
   information has not translated into a greater understanding of disease
   complexity to satisfy diagnostic and therapeutic needs. Challenges
   include noncompatible technology platforms, the need for wide-scale and
   long-term deployment of sensor technology (among vulnerable elderly
   patients in particular), and the gap between the big data acquired with
   sensitive measurement technologies and their limited clinical
   application. Major opportunities could be realized if new technologies
   are developed as part of open-source and/or open-hardware platforms that
   enable multichannel data capture sensitive to the broad range of motor
   and nonmotor problems that characterize PD and are adaptable into
   self-adjusting, individualized treatment delivery systems. The
   International Parkinson and Movement Disorders Society Task Force on
   Technology is entrusted to convene engineers, clinicians, researchers,
   and patients to promote the development of integrated measurement and
   closed-loop therapeutic systems with high patient adherence that also
   serve to (1) encourage the adoption of clinico-pathophysiologic
   phenotyping and early detection of critical disease milestones, (2)
   enhance the tailoring of symptomatic therapy, (3) improve subgroup
   targeting of patients for future testing of disease-modifying
   treatments, and (4) identify objective biomarkers to improve the
   longitudinal tracking of impairments in clinical care and research. This
   article summarizes the work carried out by the task force toward
   identifying challenges and opportunities in the development of
   technologies with potential for improving the clinical management and
   the quality of life of individuals with PD. (c) 2016 International

Abstract = {{The maker movement has shown how off-the-shelf devices can be combined
   to perform operations that, until recently, required expensive
   specialized equipment. Applying this philosophy to microfluidic devices
   can play a fundamental role in disseminating these technologies outside
   specialist labs and into industrial use. Here we show how nanoliter
   droplets can be manipulated using a commercial DVD writer, interfaced
   with an Arduino electronic controller. We couple the optical setup with
   a droplet generation and manipulation device based on the ``confinement
   gradients{''} approach. This device uses regions of different depths to
   generate and transport the droplets, which further simplifies the
   operation and reduces the need for precise flow control. The use of
   robust consumer electronics, combined with open source hardware, leads
   to a great reduction in the price of the device, as well as its
   footprint, without reducing its performance compared with the laboratory
   setup.}},

Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Wireless Sensor and Actuators Networks (WSANs) constitute one of the
   most challenging technologies with tremendous socio-economic impact for
   the next decade. Functionally and energy optimized hardware systems and
   development tools maybe is the most critical facet of this technology
   for the achievement of such prospects. Especially, in the area of
   agriculture, where the hostile operating environment comes to add to the
   general technological and technical issues, reliable and robust WSAN
   systems are mandatory. This paper focuses on the hardware design
   architectures of the WSANs for real-world agricultural applications. It
   presents the available alternatives in hardware design and identifies
   their difficulties and problems for real-life implementations. The paper
   introduces SensoTube, a new WSAN hardware architecture, which is
   proposed as a solution to the various existing design constraints of
   WSANs. The establishment of the proposed architecture is based, firstly
   on an abstraction approach in the functional requirements context, and
   secondly, on the standardization of the subsystems connectivity, in
   order to allow for an open, expandable, flexible, reconfigurable, energy
   optimized, reliable and robust hardware system. The SensoTube
   implementation reference model together with its encapsulation design
   and installation are analyzed and presented in details. Furthermore, as
   a proof of concept, certain use cases have been studied in order to
   demonstrate the benefits of migrating existing designs based on the
   available open-source hardware platforms to SensoTube architecture.}},

Abstract = {{The open-source release of self-replicating rapid prototypers (RepRaps)
   has created a rich opportunity for low-cost distributed digital
   fabrication of complex 3-D objects such as scientific equipment. For
   example, 3-D printable reactionware devices offer the opportunity to
   combine open hardware microfluidic handling with lab-on-a-chip
   reactionware to radically reduce costs and increase the number and
   complexity of microfluidic applications. To further drive down the cost
   while improving the performance of lab-on-a-chip paper-based
   microfluidic prototyping, this study reports on the development of a
   RepRap upgrade capable of converting a Prusa Mendel RepRap into a wax
   3-D printer for paper-based microfluidic applications. An open-source
   hardware approach is used to demonstrate a 3-D printable upgrade for the
   3-D printer, which combines a heated syringe pump with the
   RepRap/Arduino 3-D control. The bill of materials, designs, basic
   assembly, and use instructions are provided, along with a completely
   free and open-source software tool chain. The open-source hardware
   device described here accelerates the potential of the nascent field of
   electrochemical detection combined with paper-based microfluidics by
   dropping the marginal cost of prototyping to nearly zero while
   accelerating the turnover between paper-based microfluidic designs.}},

Abstract = {{Additive manufacturing with 3-D printers may be a key technology enabler
   for entrepreneurs seeking to use disruptive innovations such as business
   models utilizing distributed manufacturing. Unlike centralized
   manufacturing, distributed manufacturing makes the parts and products
   (the prints) at (or closer to) the source of the demand, cutting out
   much of the traditional supply chain. Although many expect 3-D printing
   to take off at the household level and previous work has shown
   significant returns for those choosing to do so, there are still
   significant barriers to entry for typical consumers. Our analysis
   demonstrates that for an individual to make an abnormally high return on
   their investments in 3-D printers, they must serve others to achieve
   high utilization rates. The impetus to do so is created by a service
   that can undercut traditionally manufactured products due to
   affordability and customizability. Low-cost, open-source 3-D printers
   are now priced within range of individual entrepreneurs who can take
   advantage of the long tail of consumers with highly varied interests.
   The margin advantage, net present value, and return on investment (ROI)
   analysis provided herein could form the basis of thousands of new
   small-business ventures in the coming years.}},

Abstract = {{The precision and repeatability offered by computer-aided design and
   computer-numerically controlled techniques in biofabrication processes
   is quickly becoming an industry standard. However, many hurdles still
   exist before these techniques can be used in research laboratories for
   cellular and molecular biology applications. Extrusion-based bioprinting
   systems have been characterized by high development costs, injector
   clogging, difficulty achieving small cell number deposits, decreased
   cell viability, and altered cell function post-printing. To circumvent
   the high-price barrier to entry of conventional bioprinters, we designed
   and 3D printed components for the adaptation of an inexpensive
   `off-the-shelf' commercially available 3D printer. We also demonstrate
   via goal based computer simulations that the needle geometries of
   conventional commercially standardized, `luer-lock' syringe-needle
   systems cause many of the issues plaguing conventional bioprinters. To
   address these performance limitations we optimized flow within several
   microneedle geometries, which revealed a short tapered injector design
   with minimal cylindrical needle length was ideal to minimize cell strain
   and accretion. We then experimentally quantified these geometries using
   pulled glass microcapillary pipettes and our modified, low-cost 3D
   printer. This systems performance validated our models exhibiting:
   reduced clogging, single cell print resolution, and maintenance of cell
   viability without the use of a sacrificial vehicle. Using this system we
   show the successful printing of human induced pluripotent stem cells
   (hiPSCs) into Geltrex and note their retention of a pluripotent state 7
   d post printing. We also show embryoid body differentiation of hiPSC by

Abstract = {{Supporting learners affectively while carrying out stressful educational
   activities is an open research issue. It requires the appropriate
   infrastructure for recognizing emotional states and reacting accordingly
   in runtime. In this paper, we describe the open platform that we have
   implemented (named AICARP v2) to detect changes in physiological signals
   that can be associated with stressful situations, and when this happens,
   it recommends the learner to relax by delivering modulated sensorial
   support in terms of light, sound, or vibration at a relaxation breath
   rate. In this way, by taking advantage of ambient intelligence, the
   learner can perceive the recommended action without interrupting the
   learning activity (in this case, practicing the oral exam of a second
   language). The signal acquisition of the system (which combines sensors
   from Libellium e-Health platform with others integrated ad hoc) has been
   compared with a commercial system (J\&J Engineering I-330-C2), obtaining
   similar outcomes as to identifying significant changes in the
   physiological signals when the learner experiments an emotional
   reaction. However, the cost of AICARP v2 is much lower, and at the same
   time, it is open hardware and flexible and, thus, has the advantage of
   providing runtime data processing. User studies have served to evaluate
   participants' perception of the sensorial support, as well as to
   calibrate the delivery rule and to evaluate the effectiveness of the
   support provided to them.}},

Abstract = {{Smart meters are an enabling technology for many smart grid
   applications. This paper introduces a design for a low-cost smart meter
   system as well as explaining fundamentals of smart metering. The smart
   meter platform, provided as open hardware, is designed with a connector
   interface compatible to the Arduino platform, thus opening the
   possibilities for smart meters with flexible hardware and computation
   features, starting from low-cost 8 bitmicro controllers up to powerful
   single board computers that can run Linux. The metering platform
   features a current transformer which allows a non-intrusive installation
   of the current measurement unit. The suggested design can switch loads,
   offers a variable sampling frequency, and provides measurement data such
   as active power, reactive and apparent power. Results indicate that
   measurement accuracy and resolution of the proposed metering platform
   are sufficient for a range of different applications and loads from a
   few watts up to 5 kW.}},

Abstract = {{Open reduction internal fixation of proximal humerus fractures is often
   accomplished with proximal humerus locking plates. While these plates
   have a good track record, they can become symptomatic and require
   removal once the fracture has healed. Open hardware removal is
   associated with a number of additional risks to the patient, including
   infection, scarring, nerve damage, and blood loss. In addition, the
   recovery time after open hardware removal may be prolonged, thereby
   predisposing the patient to postoperative stiffness. The purpose of this
   article is to describe a technique for removing proximal humerus locking
   plates arthroscopically. Although technically demanding, the benefits of
   this technique include smaller incisions, quicker recovery time,
   decreased risk of infection, and reduced blood loss. Arthroscopy also
   provides the surgeon with the ability to address concomitant
   intra-articular pathology at the time of surgery. Additionally, we use a
   bone-void filler to reduce the risk of fracture through stress caused by
   previous screw holes.}},

Volume = {{39}},

Abstract = {{The need for automated analyzers for industrial and environmental
   samples has triggered the research for new and cost-effective strategies
   of automation and control of analytical systems. The widespread
   availability of open-source hardware together with novel analytical
   methods based on pulsed flows have opened the possibility of
   implementing standalone automated analytical systems at low cost. Among
   the areas that can benefit from this approach are the analysis of
   industrial products and effluents and environmental analysis. In this
   work, a multi-pumping flow system is proposed for the determination of
   phosphorus in effluents and polluted water samples. The system employs
   photometric detection based on the formation of molybdovanadophosphoric
   acid, and the fluidic circuit is built using three solenoid micropumps.
   The detection is implemented with a low cost LED-photodiode photometric
   detection system and the whole system is controlled by an open-source
   Arduino Uno microcontroller board. The optimization of the timing to
   ensure the color development and the pumping cycle is discussed for the
   proposed implementation. Experimental results to evaluate the system
   behavior are presented verifying a linear relationship between the
   relative absorbance and the phosphorus concentrations for levels as high
   as 50 mg L-1.}},

Abstract = {{The availability of free and open source hardware designs that can be
   replicated with low-cost 3D printers provides large values to scientists
   who need highly-customized low-volume production scientific equipment.
   Digital manufacturing technologies have only recently become widespread
   and the return on investment (ROI) was not clear, so funding for open
   hardware development was historically sparse. This paper clarifies a
   method for determining an ROI for the development of scientific free and
   open source hardware (FOSH). By using an open source hardware design
   that can be manufactured digitally, the relatively minor development
   costs result in enormous ROIs for the scientific community. A case study
   is presented of a syringe pump released under open license, which
   results in ROIs for funders ranging from hundreds to thousands of
   percent after only a few months. It is clear that policies encouraging
   FOSH scientific hardware development should be adopted by organizations
   interested in maximizing return on public investments for science.}},

Abstract = {{OpenPET is an open source, modular, extendible, and high-performance
   platform suitable for multi-channel data acquisition and analysis. Due
   to the flexibility of the hardware, firmware, and software
   architectures, the platform is capable of interfacing with a wide
   variety of detector modules not only in medical imaging but also in
   homeland security applications. Analog signals from radiation detectors
   share similar characteristics-a pulse whose area is proportional to the
   deposited energy and whose leading edge is used to extract a timing
   signal. As a result, a generic design method of the platform is adopted
   for the hardware, firmware, and software architectures and
   implementations. The analog front-end is hosted on a module called a
   Detector Board, where each board can filter, combine, timestamp, and
   process multiple channels independently. The processed data is formatted
   and sent through a backplane bus to a module called Support Board, where
   1 Support Board can host up to eight Detector Board modules. The data in
   the Support Board, coming from 8 Detector Board modules, can be
   aggregated or correlated (if needed) depending on the algorithm
   implemented or runtime mode selected. It is then sent out to a computer
   workstation for further processing. The number of channels (detector
   modules), to be processed, mandates the overall OpenPET System
   Configuration, which is designed to handle up to 1,024 channels using
   16-channel Detector Boards in the Standard System Configuration and
   16,384 channels using 32-channel Detector Boards in the Large System
   Configuration.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the low cost of easy-to-use components of open-source hardware
   and software, the Internet of Things may be pervading through everything
   everywhere. The dependability of the Internet of Things is critical
   because the services will be concerned with real life. However, the
   inexpensive hardware provides limited resources for communication. In
   this paper, we present exact all-terminal reliability of the wireless
   networks of which the number of links of each node is bounded. First, we
   analyze the all-terminal reliability of the regular wireless network,
   where any two nodes are connected by a wireless link consisting of a
   pair of radio modules. The reliability polynomial is derived from the
   Tutte polynomial that is the seminal work of the algebraic graph theory.
   Second, we analyze the all-terminal reliability of the wireless network
   including the random mesh network under the assumption that if the
   module fails, all radio links connected through a radio module are cut
   off. We consider both the fault of the communication module and the
   fading of the wireless channel in the indoor channel condition. For
   improving the reliability, we also propose a fault-tolerant method
   giving redundant radio modules into each node. We also analyze
   cost-effectiveness. We also calculate the mean-time-to-failure (MTTF)
   for wireless networks. We show that the random mesh network of which
   each node includes three or more the radio-broadcast modules is more
   dependable than any other regular network of which each node comprises
   four point-to-point modules if it is the connected graph in the static
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{The deformation monitoring of structures and buildings is an important
   task field of modern engineering surveying, ensuring the standing and
   reliability of supervised objects over a long period. Several commercial
   hardware and software solutions for the realization of such monitoring
   measurements are available on the market. In addition to them, a
   research team at the University of Applied Sciences in Neubrandenburg
   (NUAS) is actively developing a software package for monitoring purposes
   in geodesy and geotechnics, which is distributed under an open source
   licence and free of charge.
   The task of managing an open source project is well-known in computer
   science, but it is fairly new in a geodetic context. This paper
   contributes to that issue by detailing applications, frameworks, and
   interfaces for the design and implementation of open hardware and
   software solutions for sensor control, sensor networks, and data
   management in automatic deformation monitoring. It will be discussed how
   the development effort of networked applications can be reduced by using
   free programming tools, cloud computing technologies, and rapid

Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{A critical parameter to assess the environmental status of water bodies
   is the transparency of the water, as it is strongly affected by
   different water quality related components (such as the presence of
   phytoplankton, organic matter and sediment concentrations). One
   parameter to assess the water transparency is the diffuse attenuation
   coefficient. However, the number of subsurface irradiance measurements
   obtained with conventional instrumentation is relatively low, due to
   instrument costs and the logistic requirements to provide regular and
   autonomous observations. In recent years, the citizen science concept
   has increased the number of environmental observations, both in time and
   space. The recent technological advances in embedded systems and sensors
   also enable volunteers (citizens) to create their own devices (known as
   Do-It-Yourself or DIY technologies). In this paper, a DIY instrument to
   measure irradiance at different depths and automatically calculate the
   diffuse attenuation K-d coefficient is presented. The instrument, named
   KdUINO, is based on an encapsulated low-cost photonic sensor and Arduino
   (an open-hardware platform for the data acquisition). The whole
   instrument has been successfully operated and the data validated
   comparing the KdUINO measurements with the commercial instruments.
   Workshops have been organized with high school students to validate its
   feasibility.}},

Abstract = {{The smart e-bike monitoring system (SEMS) is a platform for the
   real-time acquisition of usage data from electrically-assisted bikes
   (also called pedelecs or e-bikes). It is autonomous (runs off the bike
   battery), replicable (open source and open hardware), scalable
   (different fleet sizes) and modular (sensors can be added), so it can be
   used for further research and development. The system monitors location
   (global positioning system), rider control data (level of assistance)
   and other custom sensor input in real time. The SEMS data feeds an
   online interface for data analysis, for riders to view their own data
   and for sharing on social media. The basic system can be replicated by
   other researchers and can be extended with modules to explore various
   issues in e-bike research. The source code and hardware design are
   publicly available, under the General Public License, for non-commercial
   use. SEMS was implemented on 30 bikes and collected data during 10
   months of real-word trials in the UK. This study details the design and
   implementation of the hardware and software, discusses the system use
   and explores features for future design iterations. The SEMS turns
   singular e-bikes into a networked fleet and is an example of the
   internet of things in the cycling context.}},

   printers, mechanical designs can now be shared, improved, and replicated
   faster and more easily than ever before. However, printed parts are
   typically plastic and often perform poorly compared to traditionally
   machined mechanisms. We have overcome many of the limitations of 3D
   printed mechanisms by exploiting the compliance of the plastic to
   produce a monolithic 3D printed flexure translation stage, capable of
   sub-micron-scale motion over a range of 8 x 8 x 4 mm. This requires
   minimal post-print clean-up and can be automated with readily available
   stepper motors. The resulting plastic composite structure is very stiff
   and exhibits remarkably low drift, moving less than 20 mu m over the
   course of a week, without temperature stabilisation. This enables us to
   construct a miniature microscope with excellent mechanical stability,
   perfect for time-lapse measurements in situ in an incubator or fume
   hood. The ease of manufacture lends itself to use in containment
   facilities where disposability is advantageous and to experiments
   requiring many microscopes in parallel. High performance mechanisms
   based on printed flexures need not be limited to microscopy, and we
   anticipate their use in other devices both within the laboratory and
   beyond. (C) 2016 Author(s).}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes the use of OSHW to successfully penetrate the
   Internet of Things (IoT) market by using a social platform with a new
   interdisciplinary perspective rather than through the use of existing
   technical approaches. Snowball sampling was used in this study to survey
   300 people who work and have had experiences with online brand
   communities for open source hardware (OSHW) at Fab Lab Seoul. The
   findings of this study indicate that content, consumer support, user
   interface, and reward are among the five factors that trigger an online
   brand community to develop a social OSHW platform. However, this study
   also found that brand reputation was insignificant relative to
   activating a social media platform for open-source software. In
   addition, activating a social platform for OSHW can positively affect to
   the brand community's loyalty for OSHW, which means that social platform
   innovation for OSHW can help form the positive attitude necessary to
   develop and diffuse an OSHW culture in a rapidly changing ICT ecosystem.
   This can be an important strategy for OSHW business and can contribute
   to the growth of the IoT market in South Korea. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to articulate the need for an open,
   extensible robot platform to support swarm robotic research using vision
   and to propose one such platform. The platform proposed here is intended
   for research which trades smaller population size with more
   sophisticated individual robot capabilities. The validation of proposed
   swarm robotic algorithms using real-world hardware is essential, but is
   fraught with difficulty due to the expense and complexity of developing
   and maintaining multiple operational units. A number of open hardware
   platforms have been proposed, although most prioritize small size and
   low cost over advanced capabilities such as vision. We are interested in
   a number of different research directions which utilize vision as a core
   capability and find the existing open hardware platforms to be
   insufficient (and existing commercial platforms too expensive). In this
   paper we describe a set of desirable characteristics for an open,
   extensible visually-guided robot platform. We then present our solution,
   the BuPiGo (pronounced buppy-go), describing the hardware itself and a
   model developed for simulation purposes. We also present some initial
   results on using the BuPiGo for visual homing an individual navigation
   task that we hope to exploit for swarm tasks in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Machines in general and robots in particular, appeal greatly to children
   and youth. With the widespread availability of low-cost open source
   hardware and free open source software, robotics has become central to
   the promotion of STEM education in schools, and active learning at
   college/university level. With robots, children in developed countries
   gain from technological immersion, or exposure to the latest
   technologies and gadgets. Yet, developing countries like India still lag
   in the use of robots at school and even college level. In this paper, an
   innovative and low-cost educational outdoor mobile robot is developed
   for deployment by school children during volunteer trash pickup. The
   wheeled mobile robot is constructed with inexpensive commercial
   off-the-shelf components, including single board computer and
   miscellaneous sensors. It is remote controlled by children using smart
   phone app or video game controller. The robot is also equipped with air
   quality sensors to display air pollution levels to the children and
   public. The project can improve STEM education, environmental literacy
   and civic engagement among school children, while providing
   interdisciplinary service learning opportunities for college and
   university students. Results of a prototype mobile robot design,
   development, and deployment are presented to illustrate the
   effectiveness of the approach.}},

Abstract = {{Electrophysiology has recently evolved into an interactive,
   high-throughput endeavor. Recording from dozens to hundreds of
   electrodes is today routine; novel means of manipulating the system in
   real time, through electrical stimulation, optogenetics or sensory
   manipulation are allowing us to decipher neural circuit function at an
   unparalleled rate. To contribute to the wide dissemination of such
   techniques, we present an open hardware project, High-Channel Count
   Electrophysiology (HiCCE), aiming to produce low-cost, high-channel
   count (>= 128 channels) electrophysiology instrumentation capable of
   fast data acquisition rates, real-time processing and feedback
   capabilities. Our design is centered on an open standard, FPGA Mezzanine
   Card (FMC), which permits a varied choice of FPGA carrier architectures
   suited to different laboratory experimental needs. The HiCCE-128, a
   low-cost high-performance 128-channel data acquisition board for small
   voltage signals, is being introduced. It is a FMC module that can be
   operated from any FPGA carrier conforming to the FMC/VITA57 standard.
   This specialized board with a low input referred noise of about 3 mu V
   is capable of acquiring 128 channels simultaneously at 31.25 kS/s per
   channel with 16 effective bits of resolution. We present the global
   architecture and some preliminary measurement to illustrate its
   potential for electrophysiological and medical applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a methodology for learning of languages programming
   using open hardware tools. It has chosen as study case, the teaching of
   Python language due to versatility, structure and robustness that this
   language provides in the design and construction of hardware and
   software elements in devices such as Arduino or Raspberry PI. However,
   this methodology can be employed in the teaching of other type of
   programming languages such as C, Java, or Dart. It has selected as
   educational framework of the methodology some sections of the model
   known as Stage Self Direct Learning (SSDL) which provides a conceptual
   base that serves as reference model allowing to build a methodology in
   which the students will be participant of their own educational process.
   In order to enhance the learning process in the students, in the
   structure of course, it has designed an e-learning course taking as
   platform to ILIAS (Integriertes Lern-, Informations-und
   Arbeitskooperations-System). It is an open source platform with some
   features such as Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM)
   resources, forums, surveys, taxonomy services, exercises and assessment.
   During the development of course, different kinds of resources were
   created and shared through this platform, these were subject to
   discussion providing a space for the exchange of ideas and experiences
   associated with the main topics of this course. The methodology
   established allowed to encourage the interest of the students in the
   learning and use of programming languages as likewise using them in the
   design of projects that require the use of open hardware resources.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-Physical Production System (CPSS) and Service Provisioning are two
   inevitable trends and challenges for factories of the future. Existing
   literature in the Internet of Things (IoT) landscape detail
   opportunities and difficulties, but performance data to evaluate the
   overheads and suitability of services provisioning for industrial
   applications is not readily available. So, we designed and developed a
   General Telematic Framework for Rapid Application Development using
   Service-Oriented Architectural (SOA) principles and then provisioned
   services used in typical CPSS environments on embedded Raspberry Pi
   hardware modules. Performance profiling demonstrates the suitability for
   Industry-grade CPSS applications. Other applications such as Unmanned
   Aerial Vehicle search and rescue, Vehicular Tracking, and distributed
   management systems are also possible with OSGi-based, embedded
   telematics system.}},

Abstract = {{The growing availability of robotic platforms and open-source software
   presents a striking opportunity for the advancement of scientific
   instrumentation. Multirotors are particularly versatile platforms which
   offer some clear advantages for marine-based research missions including
   mapping and surveying of coastal, glacial, or marine features,
   photogrammetry, remote atmospheric or water sample collection, specimen
   tracking, and rare-event monitoring. The Olin College Intelligent
   Vehicle Laboratory has been actively developing on multirotor platforms
   to autonomously perform these missions, with special focus on
   photogrammetric and breath condensate sample collection from cetaceans.
   A critical part of our work is the design of an intelligent controller
   which will allow the multirotor to land on the deck of a research vessel
   or vessel of opportunity following the completion of a mission. A
   central control computer that may be located on the vessel will call the
   multirotor to return to the research vessel's deck, which has continued
   to travel during the mission. A global positioning system (GPS) attached
   to a specialized platform on the deck of the boat provides the current
   position of the landing platform to the multirotor. Once the multirotor
   arrives above the perceived location of the landing platform, a downward
   facing camera mounted onto the vehicle is used to identify a fiducial
   element that is located on the platform. Using the fiducial element and
   known state of the vehicle, a visual surveying methodology is used to
   allow the vehicle to land accurately on the specialized landing
   platform.
   Unlike in most simulated or controlled environments, the deck of a
   vessel of opportunity can move unpredictably in 5 axes (roll, pitch,
   yaw, longitudinal, latitudinal) due to oceanic characteristics and
   weather conditions. At present, trained multirotor pilots are the
   standard for controlling air vehicles, especially under these
   conditions. The scalability, risk, and cost of using a highly skilled
   human pilot limits the usefulness of these platforms in large-scale
   research missions. We are aiming to minimize the cost and risk
   associated with these platforms by making them accessible to untrained
   pilots as well as allowing for use of multiple platforms at one time and
   allowing for easy design of missions that the vehicle can conduct
   semi-supervised.
   Beyond obvious physical changes to the multirotor, including reinforcing
   structures or waterproofing, the multirotor itself must behave
   adaptively and sensitively to its environment. Our multirotors are
   equipped with the open hardware/software PixHawk autopilot system, which
   automatically rejects small environmental disturbances and provides
   telemetry data, such as GPS position and state of the vehicle which we
   use for our controller. A camera mounted to a stabilizing gimbal at the
   nose of the multirotor captures HD images, and a wireless video link
   transmits these images and the data from the autopilot to the
   vessel-mounted computer for processing. Our landing platform is also
   equipped with a GPS and streams information to the central computer.
   Two types of error are calculated by the computer: macro-error and
   micro-error. Macro-error refers to the gross positions of the landing
   platform and the vehicle using GPS signals. Microerror refers to the
   position of the vehicle in reference to the position of the landing
   platform fiducial element. These are used to determine the appropriate
   thrust and directional vectors to give to the vehicle to make a
   successful landing.
   In Spring of 2016, we implemented successful fiducial identification
   using computer vision techniques which extract vehicle state and image
   information to determine relative location of the vehicle to a known
   fiducial. Using this, we have developed a preliminary controller which
   allows for station-keeping of the vehicle above an identified fiducial
   on the ground. In the Summer of 2016, we will continue to develop the
   control scheme for fiducial identification, vehicle navigation, and
   landing procedure through field tests at locations including Buzzards
   Bay, Lake Waban, and the Gloucester Harbor.
   Our technology depends upon, and is itself, open-source. This allows for
   rapid iteration of controller design and means that what we develop can
   be made widely available to the marineresearch community for immediate
   use or customization. By putting these powerful tools in the hands of
   marine researchers, the need for completing missions manually can be
   eliminated. Landing on a vessel of opportunity is a significant step
   towards fully autonomous aerial instrumentation for marine-based
   research.}},

Abstract = {{Precision Agriculture in conjunction with Variable Rate Technology aims
   at increasing productivity while reducing resource usage (water,
   fertilizers, pesticides and others). Within this context, the farm's
   management decisions include information from data collected about the
   crops health development, which need to be gathered in a timely basis.
   There are several means of obtaining information about the plants
   health, including manual data collection from sensors installed in the
   soil and/or its vicinity, mobile sensor systems, for example embedded
   sensors in UAVs, or aircrafts, or other vehicles, and satellite imagery,
   to name just a few examples. The adoption of UAVs in such applications
   has gaining a lot of attention in recent years due to ease of access,
   low cost and available flight control software. UAV systems may carry
   several sensors, which include RGB, infrared, multispectral and
   hyper-spectral cameras. These cameras are respectively more powerful, in
   terms of data quality, as well as more expensive. The current paper
   contribution include the platform model, design and characterization of
   a multispectral camera system made from two low cost, commercial of the
   shelf cameras that can be integrated in a small UAV. These
   aforementioned cameras are compatible with open source hardware, namely
   Raspberry Pi boards, that are used to collect, process and store
   information. (C) 2016, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic

   and software is increasingly being used in innovative STEM education.
   But, developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America are well
   behind the curve in the use of robots in schools and colleges. An
   innovative and extremely affordable robotic system is developed in this
   paper, whereby school children anywhere can go online and race multiple
   indoor mobile robots over the Internet. Virtual reality and force
   feedback are used to make the racing realistic and interactive. Children
   will be introduced to building their own inexpensive mobile robots using
   commercial, off-the-shelf components and materials. Advanced learners,
   e.g., college and university students, can modify and improve the
   hardware and software for Internet-based teleoperation. The project can
   be used to introduce or improve robotics education at a low cost among
   school children, while providing opportunities in service learning for
   college/university students.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is focused in the inclusion of open software tools and
   standard hardware devices into advanced mobility aids. Its urgency is
   due to the incorporation need of the numerous advances in mobile
   robotics to the area of the Assistive Technologies, and more
   specifically in the field of the so called Intelligent Wheelchairs (IW).
   In this paper we propose a common core for IWs based both on an open
   robotic platform and an open and a well extended software for robotics
   (ROS ``Robotic Operating System{''}). Such an IW core has got a
   distributed architecture whose processing nodes are linked through a CAN
   standard bus, which connects the low level control functions based on
   low cost and highly portable Cortex platforms. This paper describes also
   the autonomous navigation algorithm developed for the Intelligent
   Wheelchair by using an Extended Kalman Filter. In the chosen approach
   the absolute position of the IW (a mobile robot) is estimated using
   sensor fusion which combines data from two of the sensory systems
   included in the described open platform: the dead-reckoning system and a
   visual system based on QR landmarks located on the ceiling. Within this
   context, the paper demonstrates the potential of the platform proposal
   in relation to the quick and easy incorporation of recent advances in
   mobile robotics.}},

Abstract = {{Having a shared and accurate sense of time is critical to distributed
   Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the Internet of Things (IoT). Thanks to
   decades of research in clock technologies and synchronization protocols,
   it is now possible to measure and synchronize time across distributed
   systems with unprecedented accuracy. However, applications have not
   benefited to the same extent due to limitations of the system services
   that help manage time, and hardware-OS and OS-application interfaces
   through which timing information flows to the application. Due to the
   importance of time awareness in a broad range of emerging applications,
   running on commodity platforms and operating systems, it is imperative
   to rethink how time is handled across the system stack. We advocate the
   adoption of a holistic notion of Quality of Time (QoT) that captures
   metrics such as resolution, accuracy, and stability. Building on this
   notion we propose an architecture in which the local perception of time
   is a controllable operating system primitive with observable
   uncertainty, and where time synchronization balances applications'
   timing demands with system resources such as energy and bandwidth. Our
   architecture features an expressive application programming interface
   that is centered around the abstraction of a timeline -a virtual
   temporal coordinate frame that is defined by an application to provide
   its components with a shared sense of time, with a desired accuracy and
   resolution. The timeline abstraction enables developers to easily write
   applications whose activities are choreographed across time and space.
   Leveraging open source hardware and software components, we have
   implemented an initial Linux realization of the proposed timeline-driven
   QoT stack on a standard embedded computing platform. Results from its
   evaluation are also presented.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new cost-effective data acquisition system using
   open-source hardware and Matlab/Simulink. The proposed data acquisition
   (DAQ) system has features that it uses the framed data protocol based on
   hex encoding, it can acquire multiple data which are not of the same
   type at different sample rates, and the system receives data through USB
   communication or serial communication. The software of the proposed
   system consists of the firmware of a microcontroller and user-defined
   Simulink function block. The firmware of a microcontroller is in the
   form of a header file, and the data acquisition can be easily achieved
   by calling a few functions defined in the header file. The developed
   user-defined Simulink block can get multiple data at different sample
   rates by configuring the GUI parameters appropriately. For
   implementation of the system, we use the Arch Max, which is the
   open-source hardware with an ARM Cortex-M4 core, and also use a
   user-defined c-code S-function of Matlab/Simulink. For the demonstration
   of the superiority of the implemented system, we compare the proposed
   system's performance with that of the data acquisition system provided
   in Matlab/Simulink Instrument Control Toolbox. Finally we illustrate how
   presented system can be actually used by applying the proposed system to
   DC motor control.}},

Abstract = {{Biologically inspired vision systems, such as convolutional networks,
   have begun to rival humans in some vision tasks. A key difference
   between such systems and the human visual system is that the latter
   dedicates most of its resources to a small fraction of the visual field
   (the fovea), which it moves frequently and rapidly to acquire a series
   of rich representations of small parts of a scene. We are developing an
   artificial system to approximate this aspect of human vision on a robot.
   The main components are a novel foveating lens, and a novel gimbal that
   can perform rapid and precise stereo camera orientation. This paper
   focuses on the gimbal design, which we are releasing under an open
   hardware license. We expect that it will serve as both an advanced robot
   vision system, and a source of further insight into human vision.}},

Abstract = {{Modern industry requires an improved motor performance and the permanent
   magnet brushless DC (BLDC) motors are especially appropriate for
   applications that require a high level of accuracy and performance. The
   advanced control strategies when applied into BLDC motor drive systems
   may further enhance their performance. However, these methods are
   relatively complex and computationally intensive, which may hamper the
   implementation. Fuzzy logic control algorithm has been developed in this
   investigation and embedded into a commercially available motion control
   system for the position control of BLDC motors. BLDC motor drives
   offered by PicoMotion Inc. and Motion Control Framework software
   platform have been selected for the experiments due to their
   compactness, flexibility and the open hardware and software concept they
   have been created upon. The obtained comparative results with respect to
   the built in PI control law have confirmed that the implementation of
   more advanced control strategies on inexpensive hardware and software
   platforms, nowadays available on the market for the control of BLDC
   motors, can be practically feasible and can enhance their performance.}},

Abstract = {{Power Park comprised of multiple modular microgrids exhibits advantages
   including: better control flexibility, higher scalability, higher
   reliability, etc. The energy management system (EMS) of the Power Park
   can be divided into three layers, namely, converter layer, microgrid
   module layer and Power Park layer. In order to realize system control
   objectives in different layers, Beaglebone Black (BBB) is implemented
   for both microgrid module controller and Power Park Controller. BBB is a
   low-power open-source hardware single-board computer. Different control
   algorithms are implemented in each layer to realize respective control
   objectives. In converter layer control, converter controllers are
   scheduled to operate based on local information to realize systematic
   coordination in distributed control. In microgrid module layer, BBB
   coordinates various converters based on the Field-Area Network (FAN)
   communication. Functions like secondary voltage/frequency regulation,
   contingency analysis, etc. are executed to enhance control accuracy
   within the module. In Power Park layer, Park-Area Network (PAN) is
   implemented for communication between the central controller and
   multiple module controllers. Unit Commitment (UC), Economic Dispatch
   (ED) and Optimal Power Flow (OPF) are executed to schedule the
   coordination among modules as well as power exchange with utility grid
   to realize economic optimization.}},

   build an open-source hardware and software framework to enable
   hydroclimatic monitoring in a more cost effective manner. At present,
   several prototype system components have been designed, fabricated, and
   tested. Our design demonstrates that a complete hydroclimatic monitoring

   available systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability to interface

Abstract = {{The electrocardiographic signal (ECG) reflects the electrical behavior
   of the human heart. The ECG signal is composed by different waveforms:
   P, Q, R, S and T. The R wave is normally the easiest waveform to
   identify on the ECG. The R wave is also the component with the highest
   amplitude and its detection allows the estimation of the heart rate.
   This paper is devoted to present the design of a digital filter
   implemented on an open hardware platform called Arduino to detect the R
   wave of the ECG signal. The filter design is based on the integration of
   a smooth filter and the first order derivative. The implemented digital
   filter has been tested using different ECG signals generated by a
   patient simulator. Finally, this paper shows a positive performance of
   the implemented filter in tests related to R wave detection even in the
   presence of unwanted noise components.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents prototype implementation of low-cost, open hardware,
   static - gesture recognition system. The implemented system has three
   major components: A Glove and Sensor Unit (GSU) - consisting of a pair
   of gloves embedded with custom made, low-cost flex and contact sensors,
   a Primary Supporting Hardware (PSH) that maps change in input values
   from GSU, a Secondary Supporting Hardware (SSH) that processes the input
   values and recognizes the gesture accurately. When a gesture is signed,
   the GSU tracks the change in orientation of the fingers, which results
   in a change in voltage levels of the sensors. This change is mapped by
   the PSH and passed on to SSH which comprises of two ATmega328P
   microcontrollers, one connected to each of the glove. The two
   microcontrollers are connected in a master-slave configuration and
   communication between them is facilitated through an XBee module. The
   performance of this gesture recognition system is evaluated using a data
   set comprising of 36 unique gestures. These gestures represent a total
   of 120 gestures that include all gestures across five globally used sign
   languages. A gesture recognition engine that resides in the master
   microcontroller processes the input and identifies the gesture. The
   gesture recognition engine comprises of a two stage
   selection-elimination embedded intelligence algorithm that is used to
   enhance the system efficiency from 83.1\% to 94.5\% without any
   additional hardware. The cost of the system is USD 30, which the authors
   believe on commercialization, could be brought under USD 9.}},

Abstract = {{The deformation monitoring of structures and buildings is an important
   task field of modern engineering surveying, ensuring the standing and
   reliability of supervised objects over a long period. Several commercial
   hardware and software solutions for the realization of such monitoring
   measurements are available on the market. In addition to them, a
   research team at the Neubrandenburg University of Applied Sciences
   (NUAS) is actively developing a software package for monitoring purposes
   in geodesy and geotechnics, which is distributed under an open source
   licence and free of charge. The task of managing an open source project
   is well-known in computer science, but it is fairly new in a geodetic
   context. This paper contributes to that issue by detailing applications,
   frameworks, and interfaces for the design and implementation of open
   hardware and software solutions for sensor control, sensor networks, and
   data management in automatic deformation monitoring. It will be
   discussed how the development effort of networked applications can be
   reduced by using free programming tools, cloud computing technologies,

Abstract = {{Membrane-based water treatment processes often require sophisticated
   control and monitoring that is not possible through manual operation.
   Automated regulation of pressure or flux through a membrane is required
   to minimize membrane fouling, thus maximizing efficiency and lifespan.
   Myriad automation tools exist, ranging from single purpose-built
   solutions to numerous linked sensors and hardware controls, all analyzed
   and controlled though commercially-available proprietary hardware and
   software. This paper outlines a way to design control systems for
   membrane-based filtration that utilize open source hardware and
   software, increasing the flexibility of a system to changing performance
   requirements while simultaneously minimizing the expense in time and
   resources to implement the control scheme. The method presented here can
   reduce the capital requirement for system control by one to two orders
   of magnitude while enhancing flexibility for system expansion and
   process sharing.}},

Abstract = {{There are some data centers that are located far from the main data
   center for ensuring continuity of company's Information Technology
   operations in case the main data center encounters a serious downtime
   especially for companies engaged to work in distributed manner to
   increase quality-of-service to their customers. Environmental downtime
   is a significant cost to organizations and makes them unable to do
   business because what happens in the data center affects everyone. In
   addition, the amount of electrical energy consumed by data center
   increases with the amount of computing power installed. One strategy of
   reducing energy consumption in data centers is to adjust the temperature
   and humidity data. Installation of physical Information Technology and
   facilities related to environment on monitoring temperature, humidity,
   power, flood, smoke, air flow, room entry is the most proactive way to
   reduce the unnecessary costs of expensive hardware replacement or
   unplanned downtime and decrease energy consumed by servers. In this
   paper, we present remote system for monitoring auxiliary data centers
   implemented using open-source hardware platforms, Arduino, Raspberry Pi,
   and the Gobetwino. The objective of collecting temperature and humidity
   data allows monitoring server's health and gets alerts if things start
   to go wrong. When the temperature hits 50 degrees C., the supervisor at
   remote headquarters would get a SMS, then take appropriate actions that
   make sense to reduce electrical costs and preserve functionality of
   servers in auxiliary data centers. The data center environmental
   monitoring represents a step forward towards addressing awareness
   monitoring of energy efficiency and data centers located far with
   ability to receive a notification by email. (C) 2016 Published by

   follow-up project in which we use TalkBox as a prototyping platform to
   facilitate co-design and co-fabrication of DIY-AT. We present results
   from (1) a workshop in which users with disabilities and their
   parents/caregivers fabricated their own TalkBoxes, and (2) a
   collaborative co-design session with a nonverbal child and his mother
   wherein the potential for TalkBox variants led to novel design
   decisions. We illustrate the outcome of our process by describing the
   multi-vocabulary variant called Hot Swappable TalkBox, in which RFID
   technology is used to afford easy switching among different vocabulary

Abstract = {{Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) are promising communication devices
   between humans and machines. BCI based on non-invasive neuroimaging
   techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG) have many applications,
   however the dissemination of the technology is limited, in part because
   of the price of the hardware. In this paper we compare side by side two
   EEG amplifiers, the consumer grade OpenBCI and the medical grade g. tec
   g. USBamp. For this purpose, we employed an original montage, based on
   the simultaneous recording of the same set of electrodes. Two set of
   recordings were performed. During the first experiment a simple adapter
   with a direct connection between the amplifiers and the electrodes was
   used. Then, in a second experiment, we attempted to discard any possible
   interference that one amplifier could cause to the other by adding
   ``ideal{''} diodes to the adapter. Both spectral and temporal features
   were tested - the former with a workload monitoring task, the latter
   with an visual P300 speller task. Overall, the results suggest that the
   OpenBCI board - or a similar solution based on the Texas Instrument
   ADS1299 chip - could be an effective alternative to traditional EEG
   devices. Even though a medical grade equipment still outperforms the
   OpenBCI, the latter gives very close EEG readings, resulting in practice
   in a classification accuracy that may be suitable for popularizing BCI
   uses.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, many services and applications need to be secured. In this
   paper we present the design and the initial development of a new
   security-oriented open hardware and software platform easy to be
   integrated and capable of hiding significant complexity behind a set of
   simple high-level APIs. This SoC platform is called SEcube (TM) (Secure
   Environment cube). It is a single-chip design that embeds three main
   cores: a highly powerful processor, a Common Criteria certified
   smartcard, and a flexible FPGA. The SEcube (TM) platform provides
   several functional entry levels, ranging from the hardware to software
   APIs amenable to become service-ready in a near future. This way,
   developers who do not feel comfortable on security aspects can use the
   easy-to-use API abstraction layer and experience the Cube as a
   high-security black box. Conversely, security experts can avail of the
   open source character, and verify, change, or write from scratch the
   entire system, starting from the elementary low-level blocks.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet of Things promises an always-connected future where the
   objects surrounding us will communicate in order to make our lives
   easier, more secure, etc. This evolution is a research opportunity as
   new solutions must be found to problems ranging from network
   interconnection to data mining. In the networking community, innovative
   solutions are being developed for the Device Layer of the Internet of
   Things, which includes the IoT wireless protocols. In order to study
   their performance, researchers turn more often to real world platforms,
   commonly designated by the term ``testbeds{''}, on which they may
   implement and test the protocols and algorithms. This is even more
   important in the Industrial IoT field, where environments are perturbed
   by industrial systems like automated production systems. In this paper,
   after a brief presentation of the context of testbeds, we introduce WiNo
   and OpenWiNo, an open hardware and software framework for
   fast-prototyping in the field of the Internet of Things. Compared to
   existing platforms, the solution WiNo+OpenWiNo offers a wide array of
   Physical layers and easy integration of various sensors as it is
   developed as part of the Arduino ecosystem. It also allows research
   teams to easily and quickly deploy their own testbed into real
   environments.}},

   of OSD for environmental sustainability are hypothesized and confronted
   with the analysis of the environmental friendliness of four open source
   products. Two synergies between sustainable design and OSD are
   identified (product modularity and design for local manufacturing) as
   well as corresponding challenges for further research.}},

Abstract = {{We describe an autonomous, fully functional implementation of the BB84
   quantum key distribution protocol using open source hardware
   microcontrollers for the synchronization, communication, key sifting and
   real-time key generation diagnostics. The quantum bits are prepared in
   the polarization of weak optical pulses generated with light emitting
   diodes, and detected using a sole single-photon counter and a temporally
   multiplexed scheme. The system generates a shared cryptographic key at a
   rate of 365 bps, with a raw quantum bit error rate of 2.7\%. A detailed
   description of the peripheral electronics for control, driving and
   communication between stages is released as supplementary material. The
   device can be built using simple and reliable hardware and it is
   presented as an alternative for a practical realization of
   sophisticated, yet accessible quantum key distribution systems.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to design intelligent robots
   operating in such dynamic environments like the RoboCup Middle-Size
   League (MSL). In the RoboCup MSL, two teams of five autonomous robots
   play on an 18- x 12-m field. Equipped with sensors and on-board
   computers, each robot should be able to perceive the environment, make
   decision and control itself to play the soccer game autonomously.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents the design of our
   soccer robots, participating in RoboCup MSL. The mechanical platform,
   electrical architecture and software framework are discussed separately.
   The mechanical platform is designed modularly, so easy maintainability
   is achieved; the electronic architecture is built on industrial
   standards using PC-based control technique, which results in high
   robustness and reliability during the intensive and fierce MSL games;
   the software is developed upon the open-source Robot Operating System
   (ROS); thus, the advantages of ROS such as modularity, portability and
   expansibility are inherited.
   Findings - Based on this paper and the open-source hardware and
   software, the MSL robots can be re-developed easily to participate in
   the RoboCup MSL. The robots can also be used in other research and
   education fields, especially for multi-robot systems and distributed
   artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the main designing ideas proposed
   in the paper, i.e. using a modular mechanical structure, an industrial
   electronic system and ROS-based software, provide a common solution for
   designing general intelligent robots.
   Originality/value - The methodology of the intelligent robot design for
   highly competitive and dynamic RoboCup MSL environments is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{We implemented an educational program, based on the use of free software
   and low-cost open hardware, to excite high school students' curiosity
   about seismic-hazard issues and to engage them in the process of
   learning the best practices of seismic safety. This program was
   developed in a senior class at the high school Liceo Paschini in
   Tolmezzo (northeast Italy). The students under the supervision of their
   physics teacher and seismologists, used an Arduino board, ADXL345
   accelerometers, and open-source software to create a low-cost
   seismometer able to record local strong motion. In this article, we
   provide a ``how-to{''} (instructional) guide to enable other students to
   reproduce the experiment. Certain introductory lessons in computer
   sciences and electronics were required for the students to acquire the
   necessary skills and to fill gaps in their background knowledge. In
   addition, lectures by seismologists and specific laboratory activities
   allowed the class to explore different aspects of the physics of
   earthquakes, particularly of the seismic waves, and to become familiar
   with seismic-hazard topics through inquiry-based learning. We believe
   that this exercise is a good example of how earthquake issues can be
   taught through a multidisciplinary approach in subjects traditionally
   covered by scientific and technological disciplines.}},

Abstract = {{Health monitoring is nowadays one of the hottest markets due to the
   increasing interest in prevention and treatment of physical problems. In
   this context the development of wearable, wireless, open-source, and
   nonintrusive sensing solutions is still an open problem. Indeed, most of
   the existing commercial architectures are closed and provide little
   flexibility. In this paper, an open hardware architecture for designing
   a modular wireless sensor node for health monitoring is proposed. By
   separating the connection and sensing functions in two separate boards,
   compliant with the IEEE1451 standard, we add plug and play capabilities
   to analog transducers, while granting at the same time a high level of
   customization. As an additional contribution of the work, we developed a
   cosimulation tool which simplifies the physical connection with the
   hardware devices and provides support for complex systems. Finally, a
   wireless body area network for fall detection and health monitoring,
   based on wireless node prototypes realized according to the proposed
   architecture, is presented as an application scenario.}},

Volume = {{40}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Soldercubes are a self-reconfiguring modular robot (MR) system whose
   modules are light weight, low cost, and designed with manufacturability
   for large batch production in mind. The frequently cited promises of
   modular robotics-versatility, robustness, and low cost-assume the
   availability of large numbers of modules. However, modules in most MR
   prototypes are large, mechanically complex, expensive, and difficult to
   manufacture. Soldercubes partially overcome this contradiction through
   optimizing some components for volume manufacturing processes. With the
   integration of a soldering connector which weighs only 2 g and has no
   moving parts, Soldercubes are among the cheapest, lightest and smallest
   among comparable self-reconfiguring MR systems. This paper describes the
   Soldercube module design in detail, reports on experiments in a lattice
   configuration, explores non-lattice applications of the system, and
   discusses the effects of utilising volume manufacturing processes in
   module production. All Soldercubes design files are released as open
   source hardware.}},

   compromising IEC 60598-2-22 compliance. A systems level approach has
   been adopted, leading to the development of a diode bridge based AC/DC
   power converter. Modified COTS luminaires including this converter
   design have been irradiated (to 100 kGy TID using a Cobalt-60 source),
   with results of a subsequent photometric analysis presented. Following
   encouraging tests results, a reference design for the power converter
   has been released under the CERN Open Hardware License to encourage
   manufacturer adoption. The paper concludes with areas of interest for
   future research in further improving the radiation hardness of LED

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the programming and the use of Arduino Mega, an
   open hardware microcontroller board in generating the Space Vector
   Modulation (SVM) for three phase inverters. The design can be used for
   interfacing renewable energy sources such as solar cells and fuel cells
   to ac utility grid directly. The low cost and easily programmable
   Arduino makes the renewable energy power system more economical and
   simple. The architecture and functions of Arduino Mega is explained
   briefly. The output results are verified using the simulation carried
   out in MATLAB Simulink}},

Abstract = {{The OpenOrbiter CubeSat Development Initiative is working to build a
   small spacecraft system using open source software and open hardware
   principles. The important design considerations for the CubeSat include
   availability and performance. The essential contribution of this paper
   is the requirement elicitation and specification of system-wide
   qualities such as availability, performance, and security using quality
   attribute scenarios. The effect of using the quality-based scenarios is
   that it allows more rigorous treatment of non-functional requirements
   and hence proper selection of an architecture modeling to satisfy these
   requirements.}},
