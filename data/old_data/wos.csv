quickly developed innovative research and technology as a result of
continued funding. Synthetic biology is also growing in many developing
countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America, where it could have a large
economic impact by helping its use of genetic biodiversity in order to
boost existing industries. Starting in 2011, Argentine synthetic biology
developed along an idiosyncratic path. In 2011-2012, the main focus was
not exclusively research but also on community building through teaching
and participation in iGEM, following the template of the early ``MIT
school{''} of synthetic biology. In 2013-2015, activities diversified
and included society-centered projects, social science studies on
synthetic biology and bioart. Standard research outputs such as articles
and industrial applications helped consolidate several academic working
groups. Since 2016, the lack of a critical mass of researchers and a
funding crisis were partially compensated by establishing links with
Latin American synthetic biologists and with other socially oriented
open technology collectives. The TECNOx community is a central node in
this growing research and technology network. The first four annual
TECNOx meetings brought together synthetic biologists with other open
science and engineering platforms and explored the relationship of Latin
American technologies with entrepreneurship, open hardware, ethics and
human rights. In sum, the socioeconomic context encouraged Latin
American synthetic biology to develop in a meandering and diversifying
manner. This revealed alternative ways for growth of the field that may
be relevant to other developing countries.}",{APR 2},{357-364},{3},{40},{2020},{CRITICAL REVIEWS IN BIOTECHNOLOGY},"{Developing synthetic biology in Argentina: the Latin American TECNOx

2017, there is an increasing need for incorporating intermittent
renewable energy sources and other alternative supply/demand management
strategies into the supply grid networks. Short-term load forecasting
models enable prediction of future power consumption, thereby
encouraging shifting of loads and optimizing the use of stochastic power
sources and stored energy. To make the electric grid system smart and
sustainable, two-way communication between the utility and consumers
must be set up and the working equipment must respond digitally to the
quickly changing electric demand. The proposed work exploits the power
of embedded systems to design a low-cost solution for interconnecting
electrical and electronic devices, controlled by the intelligent
Internet of Things (IoT) paradigms. This work primarily focuses on
implementing standard regression and machine learning-based
architectures for smart grid load analysis and forecasting. A state of
the art ecosystem for a portable load forecasting device is proposed by
means of low-cost, open-source hardware that is experimentally found to
be functioning with a high degree of accuracy. Further, the performance
of the classical and advanced machine learning models, emulated on the
device, are analyzed on the basis of various parameters, including error
percentage, execution time, CPU core temperatures, and resource

specific machine learning models which are considered to be suitable for

can be seamlessly integrated into current ANSS quake monitoring systems.

There remain,
however, various challenges with respect to the concept of Industry 4.0
before this new reality is fully integrated into the industrial sector.
One such challenge is ensuring security, an essential issue in terms of
both management and operational technology involving the configuration
and administration of physical equipment. Another is integrating
equipment from different manufacturers which must be configured and/or
administered with incompatible protocols. Likewise, remote access to
systems must be carried out from a browser in the web frame. This paper
presents a set of tools, available as a cloud-based service, which
facilitates access to the physical equipment located in a business. The
access enables the end user to see and/or modify the configuration and
management of data in a secure, controlled, organized and collaborative
manner. In order to unify different protocols, the service makes use of
the Modbus TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)
protocol, one of the most commonly used by industry in local networks.
The local Modbus communications are encapsulated in the Websocket
protocol to make them accessible from the cloud. The tools proposed in
this paper are based on open hardware platforms and free software, and
they permit local and remote sensors and actuators to be fully and
easily accessed. Hence, their chief advantage is that they allow access
from any internet connection, via a browser, to the physical equipment
located in an industry by means of user profiles in accordance with the

broader concept and its related movement. One of the most fundamental
questions relating to these phenomena is why developers contribute their
private resources to these public goods. While this question has been
discussed, theorized, and empirically investigated in the context of
OSS, there has been no research so far in the context of OSH. Can we
really assume the motivations behind the development of the OSH to be
the same as those behind OSS? Based on the self-determination theory
(SDT), we provide original insights into the motivations behind
contributions to OSH development. We collected data from the most common
and active 3D printing communities, which are the main loci of OSH
development. We thus have a unique cross-sectional data set with
participants from over 30 different countries using all kinds of
different OSH platforms. Our analysis reveals several important
findings: firstly, the motivations are in some aspects very similar to
those in open source software notwithstanding different possibilities,
hurdles, and incentives regarding the OSS and OSH. Above all,
enjoyment-based intrinsic motivation is a major factor affecting
contribution levels. Secondly, among internalized extrinsic motivations,
expected private benefits through improving own skills stands out.
Thirdly, different factors of internalized extrinsic motivations can
have different moderating effects on the effect of enjoyment-based
intrinsic motivation. Given the imminent changes in business models
throughout manufacturing industries in order to adapt to the challenge
that OSH will increasingly pose, our findings have important
implications not only for OSH communities and 3D development platforms,
but also for businesses that want and probably soon have to engage in
open innovation.}",{JAN},{75-95},"{1, SI}",{50},{2020},{R \& D MANAGEMENT},"{Why makers make what they make: motivations to contribute to open source

back of strong institutional knowledge, but academic projects face
difficulties in replicating that scale. To alleviate these difficulties
and to develop and share knowledge, the community needs open
architecture frameworks for simulation, chip design, and software
exploration that support extensibility, scalability, and
configurability, alongside an established base of verification tools and
supported software. In this article, we present OpenPiton, an open
source framework for building scalable architecture research prototypes
from one core to 500 million cores. OpenPiton is the world's first open
source, general-purpose, multithreaded manycore processor, and
framework. OpenPiton is highly configurable, providing a rich design
space spanning a variety of hardware parameters that researchers can
change. OpenPiton designs can be emulated on FPGA5, where they can run
full-stack multiuser Debian Linux. OpenPiton is designed to scale to
very large core fabrics, enabling researchers to measure operating
system, compiler, and software scalability. The mature code-base
reflects the complexity of an industrial-grade design and provides the
necessary scripts to build new chips, making OpenPiton a natural choice
for computer-aided design (CAD) research. OpenPiton has been validated
with a 25-core chip prototype, named Piton, and is bolstered by a
validation suite that has thousands of tests, providing an environment
to test new hardware designs while verifying the correctness of the
whole system. OpenPiton is being actively used in research both
internally to Princeton and in the wider community, as well as being
adopted in education, industry, and government settings.}",{DEC},{79-87},{12},{62},{2019},{COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM},{OpenPiton: An Open Source Hardware Platform For Your Research},"Balkind, Jonathan and McKeown, Michael and Fu, Yaosheng and Tri Nguyen

state of users with affective computing. This has lately been applied in
the educational domain, aimed to better support learners during the
learning process. For this purpose, we have developed the AICARP
(Ambient Intelligence Context-aware Affective Recommender Platform)
infrastructure, which detects changes in the emotional state of the user
and provides personalized multisensorial support to help manage the
emotional state by taking advantage of ambient intelligence features. We
have developed a third version of this infrastructure, AICARP.V3, which
addresses several problems detected in the data acquisition stage of the
second version, (i.e., intrusion of the pulse sensor, poor resolution
and lowsignal to noise ratio in the galvanic skin response sensor and
slow response time of the temperature sensor) and extends the
capabilities to integrate new actuators. This improved incorporates a
new acquisition platform(shield) called PhyAS (Physiological Acquisition
Shield), which reduces the number of control units to only one, and
supports both gathering physiological signalswith better precision and
delivering multisensory feedback with more flexibility, by means of new
actuators that can be added/discarded on top of just that single shield.
The improvements in the quality of the acquired signals allow better
recognition of the emotional states. Thereof, AICARP.V3 gives a more
accurate personalized emotional support to the user, based on a
rule-based approach that triggers multisensorial feedback, if necessary.
This represents progress in solving an open problem: develop systems
that perform as effectively as a human expert in a complex task such as
the recognition of emotional states.}",{OCT 2},,{20},{19},{2019},{SENSORS},"{Impact of Physiological Signals Acquisition in the Emotional Support

those into vehicle automation. Advances in open hardware platforms and
off-the-shelf photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensors allow the non-intrusive
collection of heart rate data at very low cost. However, the signal is
not trivial to analyse, since the morphology of PPG waveforms differs
from electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms and shows different noise
patterns. Few validated open source available algorithms exist that
handle PPG data well, as most of these algorithms are specifically
designed for ECG data.
In this paper we present the validation of a novel algorithm named
HeartPy, useful for the analysis of heart rate data collected in noisy
settings, such as when driving a car or when in a simulator. We
benchmark the performance on two types of datasets and show that the
developed algorithm performs well. Further research steps are discussed.

with greater flexibility than is provided by previous systems by using
an innovative camera triggering solution. The main objective was to
synchronize image acquisitions with proton beam deliveries. A 3D
detector composed of 3 scientific complementary
metal-oxide-semiconductor cameras and a volumetric liquid scintillator
(20 x20x 20 cm) were used. We identified relevant signals from the
synchrotron beam delivery system to trigger the cameras. These signals
were processed using an open hardware microcontroller and monitored
using an oscilloscope. We evaluated the camera triggering scheme by
comparing the mean signal intensity and standard deviations for
triggered versus non-triggered image acquisitions at 5 energies (161.6,
140.9, 124.0, 100.9, and 85.6 MeV) with 50 spots per energy. The
performance of the triggering scheme was further investigated by testing
the image intensity variability for 5 energies delivered at 9 different
location (2 spots/location). We also measured the background signals for
different exposure times (1-1000 ms) using both triggered and
non-triggered schemes. The mean signal intensity difference between
triggered and non-triggered schemes was 10\% +/- 0.4\% for low SNR
(similar to 20 dB). The image intensity variability was within 2\%. The
background signal intensity varied by only 0.6\% from the shortest
exposure time (1 ms) to the longest (1 s). We demonstrated a flexible

radio frequency (RF) transceivers for wireless sensors, control nodes,
and USB gateway, (ii) a Raspberry Pi 3B with custom firmware acting as

using InfluxDB, and data visualization using Grafana. The platform is
built around the idea of a private, secure, and open technology for the
built environment. Among its many applications, the platform allows
occupants to investigate anomalies in energy usage, environmental
quality, and thermal performance via a comprehensive dashboard with rich
querying capabilities. It also includes multiple frontends to view and
analyze building activity data, which can be used directly in building
controls or to provide recommendations on how to increase operational
efficiency or improve operating conditions. Here, we demonstrate three
distinct applications of the Elemental platform, including: (1)
deployment in a research lab for long-term data collection and automated

contribute to conceptual theorizing about open design or study its
practical operationalization, in do-it-yourself `making,' manufacturing
and practices in-between these domains. Most of the papers reviewed were
empirical studies from diverse fields. Open design was analyzed not only
as contributions and solutions, but also as open-to-participate
processes, openly shared processes, and open, closed, and modular (open
and closed) outcomes. Various research fields presented an open design
framing as an alternative to the status quo: new ways to do business
and/or to foster socio-environmental sustainability. On the
manufacturing side, open design was sought especially to accelerate
innovation cycles; on the making side, it was espoused to foster
democratization. However, the studies reviewed indicated that companies
do not appear to develop much beyond business-as-usual. From the
research perspective, the conceptual potential of open design to promote
sustainability saw little practical exploration. Additionally, issues
around open design community governance and ownership, safety and

extend the culture of making, social innovation, open-source software,
and open-source hardware. A cornerstone for Open Design is to broaden
participation in technology innovation by allowing people to use and
contribute to publicly shared resources. Makerspaces are important
access points to share and contribute to these resources. However, prior
to entering the physical door of a makerspace, makerspaces' social media
presence serve as the `front door' for Open Design activities. In this
paper, we examine different `front doors' of Open Design, asking: What
are the characteristics that produce makerspaces' social media
presences, and how do these representations shape potential access to
Open Design activities? We manually collected and qualitatively analyzed
500 public posts on the Facebook sites of five makerspaces in
Copenhagen, Denmark. By choosing the same geographical area, we were
able to explore the characteristics of makerspaces' social media
presences for the same potential population of Open Design participants.
Our analysis identifies three main characteristics of makerspaces'
social media presence, which together shape access to Open Design
activities, namely reach, transparency, and discourse. The display of
these characteristics produce openness and availability in unique ways,
and is constitutive for how Open Design activities are produced online.
In this paper, we do not argue for or against specific social media
representations. Instead, we argue that the specificities and
differences between makerspaces' social media presences in the same
geographical region have the strength of producing different identities

studies of reward, metabolism, and circadian biology. Common approaches
for measuring liquid intake in real time include computer-tethered
lickometers or video-based systems. Additionally, liquids can be
measured or weighed to determine the amount consumed without real-time
sensing. Here, we built a photobeam-based sipper device that has the
following advantages over traditional methods: (1) it is battery powered
and fits in vivarium caging to allow home-measurements; (2) it
quantifies the intake of two different liquids simultaneously for
preference studies; (3) it is low cost and easily constructed, enabling
high-throughput experiments; and (4) it is open source so that others
can modify it to fit their experimental needs. We validated the
performance of this device in three experiments. First, we calibrated
our device using time-lapse video-based measurements of liquid intake
and correlated sipper interactions with liquid intake. Second, we used
the sipper device to measure preference for water versus chocolate milk,
demonstrating its utility for two-bottle choice tasks. Third, we
integrated the device with fiber photometry, establishing its utility
for measuring neural activity in studies of ingestive behavior. This
device requires no special equipment or caging, and is small, battery
powered, and wireless, allowing it to be placed directly in rodent home

the miniaturization of sensors and reductions in component costs.
Retrieval of animal-borne devices is often advantageous for several
reasons, including data retrieval and animal welfare considerations;
however, commercially available drop-off units are often prohibitively
expensive and/or unreliable. Here, we present `OpenDropOff', an
open-source, low-cost electronic drop-off unit for remotely detaching
animal-borne sensors from individuals. OpenDropOff devices function by
using heat, produced by running an electrical current through resistance
wire (nichrome), to melt nylon (e.g. fishing) line, detaching sensors
from animals at or after a pre-determined time. OpenDropOff can be
constructed using commercially available components (costing < USD \$15
in total; approximately 10\% or less of many commercially available
drop-off units) and can be customized to fit project- and
species-specific needs. Fourteen OpenDropOff devices have been field
deployed on koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) (n = 11), swamp wallaby
(Wallabia bicolor) (n = 1), Australian brush turkey (Alectura lathami)
(n = 1) and Australian white ibis (Threskiornis molucca) (n = 1), with
the only detachment failure occurring after a device was damaged during
the koala's unrelated death. OpenDropOff devices provide a wider range
of researchers with a reliable, cost-effective tool for detaching

The coefficient of determination between the cup Anemometer and the

low-cost UAVs for the mapping and monitoring of alpine glaciers, we
conducted multiple aerial surveys on the Kanderfirn in the Swiss Alps in
2017 and 2018 using open hardware and software of the Paparazzi UAV
project. The open-source photogrammetry software OpenDroneMap was tested
for the generation of high-resolution orthophotos and digital surface
models (DSMs) from aerial imagery and cross-checked with the
well-established proprietary software Pix4D. Accurately measured ground
control points served for the determination of the geometric accuracy of
the orthophotos and DSMs. A horizontal (xy) accuracy of 0.7-1.2 m and a
vertical (z) accuracy of 0.7-2.1 m was achieved for OpenDroneMap,
compared to a xy-accuracy of 0.3-0.5 m and a z-accuracy of 0.4-0.5 m
obtained for Pix4D. Based on the analysis and comparison of different
orthophotos and DSMs, surface elevation, roughness and brightness
changes from 3 June to 29 September 2018 were quantified. While the
brightness of the glacier surface decreased linearly over the ablation
season, the surface roughness increased. The mean DSM-based elevation
change across the glacier tongue was 8 m, overestimating the measured
melting and surface lowering at the installed ablation stakes by about
1.5 m. The presented results highlight that self-built fixed-wing UAVs
in tandem with open-source photogrammetry software are an affordable

the assessment of simulator sickness are required. The main aim of this
paper was to present a non-invasive method for assessing simulator

possible solutions. This research was conducted under an IoT design,
implementation, and assessment model for the remote monitoring of pulse
oximetry via oxygen partial saturation (SpO(2)) and heart rate (HR) with
low-energy consumption. Methods: This study focused on the development
of SpO(2) and HR measurements that will allow the monitoring and
estimation in real time of the user's state and health related to the
established parameters. Measurements were acquired and recorded using a
remote web server that recorded the acquired variables for further
processing. The statistical analysis data allows comparison of the
registered data measured with theoretical models. Results: The IoT model
was developed use Bluetooth low-energy devices, which comply with
low-cost and open-hardware solutions operated via `HTTP requests' for
data transmission and reception from a cloud server to an edge device.
Network performance assessment was conducted to guarantee the
availability and integrity of the acquired values and signals. The
system measured SpO(2) and HR variables. The most significant result was
to achieve energy consumption 20\% lower than that of devices in the

can be built using facilities frequently available at academic
institutions (machine shop, 3-D printer, open-source hardware and

rover presented in this study was equipped with a dual-frequency GPS
receiver and a digital SLR camera for constructing digital elevation
models using structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry. We deployed
this prototype rover on the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream to map local
variations in snow accumulation and surface topography. The rover
conducted four autonomous missions based out of the East Greenland
Ice-Core Project (EastGRIP) camp during July 2017, measuring surface
elevation transects across the hazardous ice-stream shear margins.
During these missions, the rover proved capable of driving over 20 km on
a single charge with a drawbar pull of 250 N, sufficient to tow
instrumentation of up to 100 kg. The rover also acquired photographs
that were subsequently used to construct digital elevation models of a
site monitored for spatiotemporal variability in snow accumulation,
demonstrating adequate stability for high-resolution imaging
applications. Due to its low cost, low-power requirements, and simple
modular design, mass deployments of this rover design are practicable.
Operation of the rover in hazardous areas circumvents the substantial
expense and risk to personnel associated with conventional, crewed
deployments. Thus, this rover is an investigatory plat-form that enables
direct exploration of polar environments considered too hazardous for

open-source solutions that include telemetry, such as EnviroDIY's
Mayfly, none presently generate real-time, remotely accessible workbooks

achieve real-time data logging from the field to the web. The Hub is an
order of magnitude less expensive than commercial products, inherently
modular and flexible, and aims to reduce technical barriers for users
with little programming experience (DeBell, 2019). Data can be collected
remotely using a host of transmission protocols to relay data from
distributed in situ monitoring devices. The Hub mesh-networks with
several nodes and backs up to an onboard microSD card. Telemetry options
include 900 MHz Long Range Radio (LoRa) with up to 25 km range and
Nordic Radio Frequency (nRF) for higher data rates (Feather, 2018).

contest focusing on multidomain emergency response scenarios. In this
context, the deployed robots are expected to fulfill land, underwater,

Robotics Team at ERL Emergency Robots 2017 was deeply affected by damage
to (and resulting unavailability of) the unmanned ground vehicle to be
used in the competition. This damage occurred 3 days before the
challenge. An entirely new working mobile platform was built from
scratch using a low-cost chassis. It was able to compete with the other
participants in the challenge and achieved various tasks (similar to
83\% of the tasks completed by the best performer). The paper provides a
complete description of the work carried out and the system used during
the competition. The development was based on low-cost solutions, in
particular: Adoption of open-hardware and open-software technology,
providing cheap and fast-prototyping solutions. Use of smartphones,
allowing sophisticated sensors to be exploited in an affordable way.
Employment of Cloud infrastructures, to reduce the computational burden
of offloading heavy processes. Results of this experience represent a
concrete demonstration, showing that even low-cost solutions can achieve
complex tasks, such as those required for the European robotic
competition. The presented lessons learned aim to provide guidelines
useful for reacting to unexpected events. Finally, the team was honored

approaches for indoor localization due to its accurate positioning
capabilities, immunity against multipath fading, and excellent
resilience against narrowband interference. However, UWB researchers are
currently limited by the small amount of feasible open source hardware
that is publicly available. We developed a new open source hardware
platform, Wi-PoS, for precise UWB localization based on Decawave's
DW1000 UWB transceiver with several unique features: support of both
long-range sub-GHz and 2.4 GHz back-end communication between nodes,
flexible interfacing with external UWB antennas, and an easy
implementation of the MAC layer with the Time-Annotated Instruction Set
Computer (TAISC) framework. Both hardware and software are open source
and all parameters of the UWB ranging can be adjusted, calibrated, and
analyzed. This paper explains the main specifications of the hardware
platform, illustrates design decisions, and evaluates the performance of
the board in terms of range, accuracy, and energy consumption. The
accuracy of the ranging system was below 10 cm in an indoor lab
environment at distances up to 5 m, and accuracy smaller than 5 cm was
obtained at 50 and 75 m in an outdoor environment. A theoretical model
was derived for predicting the path loss and the influence of the most
important ground reflection. At the same time, the average energy
consumption of the hardware was very low with only 81 mA for a tag node
and 63 mA for the active anchor nodes, permitting the system to run for
several days on a mobile battery pack and allowing easy and fast

Smart converters are simple or interleaved converters. They are equipped
with controllers that are able to online impedance match for the maximum
power transfer. These conversion systems are particularly feasible for
photovoltaic and all renewable energies systems working in continuous
changing operating conditions. Smart converters represent promising
solutions in recent energetic scenarios, in fact their application is
deepening and widening. In this context, the availability of a hardware
platform could represent a useful tool. The platform was conceived and
released as an open hardware instrument for academy and industry to
benefit from the improvements brought by the researchers' community. The
usage of a novel, open-source platform would allow many developers to
design smart converters, focusing on algorithms instead of electronics,
which could result in a better overall development ecosystem and rapid
growth in the number of smart converter applications. The platform
itself is proposed as a benchmark in the development and testing of
different maximum power point tracking algorithms. The designed system
is capable of accurate code implementations, allowing the testing of
different current and voltage-controlled algorithms for different
renewable energies systems. The circuit features a bi-directional radio
frequency communication channel that enables real-time reading of
measurements and parameters, and remote modification of both algorithm
types and settings. The proposed system was developed and successfully
tested in laboratory with a solar module simulator and with real
photovoltaic generators. Experimental results indicate state-of-art
performances as a converter, while enhanced smart features pave the way
to system-level management, real-time diagnostics, and on-the-flight
parameters change. Furthermore, the deployment feasibility allows
different combinations and arrangements of several energy sources,
converters (both single and multi-converters), and modulation
strategies. To our knowledge, this project remains the only open-source

downstream firms collaborate to develop open substitute designs for
proprietary hardware they would otherwise purchase from upstream
suppliers. This strategy centrally involves the downstream firms
distributing design costs over multiple down-stream firms-a strategy
that is routine to producers selling to multiple down-stream firms but
which has been in the past typically not practical for coalitions of
downstream firms. Today, downstream firms find it increasingly feasible
to codesign products they may all purchase because of two technological
trends. First, computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing and
other design technologies are lowering downstream firms' costs to
develop designs for purchased hardware inputs. Second, better
communication technologies are lowering the costs of doing such projects
collaboratively, even among large groups of downstream customer firms.
Downstream firms collaborating to develop a design for a hardware input
they can all purchase could in principle choose to protect their design
as a club good. However, opening up collaboratively created designs to
free riders can increase the profits of the contributing firms for
several reasons we explore and model. Important among these is that free
revealing draws free riders away from purchases of proprietary software

``scale-stealing{''} mechanism reduces the markets of up-stream
suppliers of competing proprietary inputs. In the case of hardware only,
free riders also contribute to reducing the average manufacturing costs

increased economies of scale. Resulting reduced unit purchase costs
benefit downstream firms contributing to the free design as well as free
riders.}",{MAR},{41-57},{1},{4},{2019},{STRATEGY SCIENCE},{Open Sourcing as a Profit-Maximizing Strategy for Downstream Firms},"Gambardella, Alfonso and Von Hippel, Eric",article,ISI:000461813400004,,,{Bronze},"{von Hippel, Eric/0000-0002-7235-1032}",,,,,,,,,,,,,

technology. However, affordable tools are often constrained to
short-term studies due to high energy consumption and limited storage.
To enable long-term monitoring, energy and space efficiency must be
improved on such tools. This paper describes the development and
deployment of three acoustic detection algorithms that reduce the power
and storage requirements of acoustic monitoring on affordable,
open-source hardware. The algorithms aim to detect bat echolocation, to
search for evidence of an endangered cicada species, and also to collect
evidence of poaching in a protected nature reserve. The algorithms are
designed to run on AudioMoth: a low-cost, open-source acoustic
monitoring device, developed by the authors and widely adopted by the
conservation community. Each algorithm addresses a detection task of
increasing complexity, implementing extra analytical steps to account
for environmental conditions such as wind, analysing samples multiple
times to prevent missed events, and incorporating a hidden Markov model
for sample classification in both the time and frequency domain. For
each algorithm, we report on real-world deployments carried out with
partner organisations and also benchmark the hidden Markov model against
a convolutional neural network, a deep-learning technique commonly used
for acoustics. The deployments demonstrate how acoustic detection
algorithms extend the use of low-cost, open-source hardware and
facilitate a new avenue for conservation researchers to perform
large-scale monitoring.}",{FEB 1},,{3},{19},{2019},{SENSORS},"{Deploying Acoustic Detection Algorithms on Low-Cost, Open-Source

traditional power systems to a decentralized model based on renewable
energy sources. In this new scenario, advanced devices are needed for
real-time monitoring and control of the energy flow and power quality
(PQ). Ideally, the data collected by Internet of Thing (IoT) sensors
should be shared to central cloud systems for online and off-line
analysis. In this paper openZmeter (oZm) is presented as an advanced
low-cost and open-source hardware device for high-precision energy and
power quality measurement in low-voltage power systems. An analog front
end (AFE) stage is designed and developed for the acquisition,
conditioning, and processing of power signals. This AFE can be stacked
on available quadcore embedded ARM boards. The proposed hardware is
capable of adapting voltage signals up to 800 V AC/DC and currents up to
thousands of amperes using different probes. The oZm device is described
as a fully autonomous open-source system for the computation and
visualization of PQ events and consumed/generated energy, along with
full details of its hardware implementation. It also has the ability to
send data to central cloud management systems. Given the small size of
the hardware design and considering that it allows measurements under a
wide range of operating conditions, oZm can be used both as bulk
metering or as metering/submetering device for individual appliances.

basic and preclinical research. High-resolution anatomical and
functional studies of the brain require artifact-free images that are
acquired with a highly sensitive radiofrequency (RF) coil.
New Method: The animal holder plays an important role in mitigating
image artifacts: motion artifacts are reduced by immobilizing the animal
and geometric-distortion artifacts are reduced by accurately positioning
the animal to improve static-field shimming. The RF coil, in turn, must
provide high sensitivity over the whole brain and not physically
interfere with the animal holder. To accomplish these tasks, the animal
holder and RF coil should be designed in tandem. In this manuscript,
animal holders and RF coils for mice, rats, and marmoset monkeys are
described. Each animal holder includes components for anesthesia
delivery and animal immobilization, as well as a compatible receive
coil.
Results/Comparison with Existing Method(s): Animal holders were capable
of accurate and reproducible positioning (for the marmoset, this was in
the stereotactic plane), consequently reducing geometric distortion in
echo-planar images. Ear bars were designed in conjunction with
receive-coil formers, thereby maximizing the sensitive region of coils,
while concurrently reducing motion to less than a pixel over EPI time
series. Motion and SNR were quantified to facilitate direct comparison
to existing animal holders and RF coils. All computer-aided-design (CAD)
files of animal holders and RF coils are provided to promote
dissemination.
Conclusions: The confluence of design between the animal holder and RF
coil provides a pragmatic solution for routine imaging of small animals.}",{JAN 15},{65-72},,{312},{2019},{JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS},"{Open-source hardware designs for MRI of mice, rats, and marmosets:

floating-point numbers. It is a floating-point system that trades
exponent bits for significand bits, depending on the magnitude of the
numbers. Thus, it provides more precision for numbers around 1, at the
expense of lower precision for very large or very small numbers. Several
works have demonstrated that this trade-off can improve the accuracy of
applications. However, the variable-length exponent and significand
encoding impacts the hardware cost of posit arithmetic. The objective of
the present work is to enable application-level evaluations of the posit
system that include performance and resource consumption.
To this purpose, this article introduces an open-source hardware
implementation of the posit number system, in the form of a C++
templatized library compatible with Vivado HLS. This library currently
implements addition, subtraction and multiplication for custom-size
posits. In addition, the posit standard also mandates the presence of
the ``quire{''}, a large accumulator able to perform exact sums of
products. The proposed library includes the first open-source
parameterized hardware quire.
This library is shown to improve the state-of-the-art of posit
implementations in terms of latency and resource consumption. Still,
standard 32 bits posit adders and multipliers are found to be much
larger and slower than the corresponding floating-point operators. The
cost of the posit 32 quire is shown to be comparable to that of a
Kulisch accumulator for 32 bits floating-point.}",,{106-113},,,{2019},,{Evaluating the hardware cost of the posit number system},"Uguen, Yohann and Forget, Luc and de Dinechin, Florent",inproceedings,ISI:000518670300016,"{This work was partly funded by the Imprenum project of Agence Nationale

increasingly interconnected with each generation. Thus, these platforms
grow more complex, with new features continually introducing the
possibility of new bugs. Although the semiconductor industry employs a
combination of different verification techniques to ensure the security
of System-on-Chip (SoC) designs, a growing number of increasingly
sophisticated attacks are starting to leverage cross-layer bugs. These
attacks leverage subtle interactions between hardware and software, as
recently demonstrated through a series of real-world exploits that
affected all major hardware vendors.
In this paper, we take a deep dive into microarchitectural security from
a hardware designer's perspective by reviewing state-of-the-art
approaches used to detect hardware vulnerabilities at design time. We
show that a protection gap currently exists, leaving chip designs
vulnerable to software-based attacks that can exploit these hardware
vulnerabilities. Inspired by real-world vulnerabilities and insights
from our industry collaborator (a leading chip manufacturer), we
construct the first representative testbed of real-world
software-exploitable RTL bugs based on RISC-V SoCs. Patching these bugs
may not always be possible and can potentially result in a product
recall. Based on our testbed, we conduct two extensive case studies to
analyze the effectiveness of state-of-the-art security verification
approaches and identify specific classes of vulnerabilities, which we
call HardFails, which these approaches fail to detect. Through our work,
we focus the spotlight on specific limitations of these approaches to
propel future research in these directions. We envision our RISC-V
testbed of RTL bugs providing a rich exploratory ground for future
research in hardware security verification and contributing to the

environment was developed based on Raspberry Pi, MySQL and Android. The
system consists of a greenhouse control system (subsystem A), an
environment monitoring system (subsystem B), a MySQL remote database
(subsystem C), and an Android monitoring software (subsystem D). The
subsystem A is used to implement automatic fertigation and collect data
from subsystem B, which will be uploaded to cloud server database
(subsystem C). The subsystem B is used to monitor the environmental
parameters in the greenhouse such as air temperature/humidity, soil
temperature/humidity etc. The subsystem C is used for storage of
greenhouse environment data and communication between subsystem B and
subsystem D. The subsystem D is used for data visualization including
real-time display, storage and analysis of greenhouse environmental
data, and remote control of fertigation system including the EC/pH
control of the fertigation solution, irrigation scheduling, and
fertigation settings. A proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control
algorithm is used for the fertigation process of the subsystem A. The
low-power LoRa technology is used for subsystem B to achieve low-power
long-distance data transmission, which is especially suitable to
greenhouses. All monitoring settings can be operated remotely by users.

great importance. Recent news regarding global warming has increased the
need to save energy. In Finland, one of the major sources of energy
consumption is housing. Furthermore, the heating of residential
buildings accounts for up to 68\% of housing energy consumption.
Therefore, it is not surprising that apartment energy consumption and
ways to save energy in housing are a popular research topic in Finland.
In this paper, two different research areas are introduced: First, a
literature survey is presented on the research subjects of energy saving
in the area of real estate and housing. The goal is to gain overall
knowledge of the current state of energy saving research. The overall
conclusion is that knowledge of energy consumption improves efforts
toward energy saving. Second, rapid prototyping with off-the-shelf
devices and open source software are described. These devices are cheap
to install, and a wide range of sensors are available. Consequently, it
is important to deal with these topics together. The former studies
provide knowledge about the usage of open hardware, open software, and
open architectures with the development of prototype systems for
gathering data. The literature survey gives us new information on the
specialties of energy consumption measuring, offering a new area for
modeling and developing prototype systems. These experiences will be
taken forward and utilized in energy saving and environmentally

wide range of real-world problems. However, they suffer from some design
issues related to the difficulty to implement them on different hardware
platforms without additional efforts. To bridge this gap, recently, the
IEEE Computational Intelligence Society has sponsored the publication of
the standard IEEE Std 1855-2016 which is aimed at providing the fuzzy
community with a well-defined approach to model FRBSs in a
hardware-independent way. In order to provide a runnable version of an
FRBS that is designed in accordance with the IEEE Std 1855-2016, the
open source library Java Fuzzy Markup Language (JFML) has been
developed. However, due to hardware and/or software limitations of
embedded systems, it is not always possible to run an IEEE Std 1855-2016
FRBS on this kind of systems. The aim of this paper is to overcome this
drawback by developing a new JFML module that assists developers in the
design and implementation of FRBSs for open hardware-embedded systems.
In detail, the module supports several connection types (WiFi,
Bluetooth, and USB) in order to make feasible running FRBSs in a remote
computer when, due to hardware limitations, it is not possible that they
run locally in the embedded systems. The new JFML module is ready for
ArduinoTM and Raspberry Pi, but it can be easily extended to other
hardware architectures. Moreover, the new JFML module allows to
automatically generate runnable files on Arduino(TM) or Raspberry Pi in
order to support nonexpert users, that is, users without specific
knowledge about embedded systems or without strong programming skills.
The use of the new JFML module is illustrated in two case studies. (c)

a high volume of entries in a reference data set, according to a chosen
similarity metric such as the L1-norm, L2-norm, or Hamming distance.
Large-scale research and commercial applications of these computations
are developing rapidly across artificial intelligence fields as diverse
as semantic text querying, retrieval of multimedia materials, and
prediction of the properties of pharmacological molecules and engineered
materials. While vector similarity searching is, at present,
predominantly implemented on standard central processing unit (CPU)
hardware running optimized indexing algorithms, the interest in
massively-parallel computing architectures is increasing. Accordingly, a
range of systems based on graphics processing units (GPU) and
field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) have been proposed; however, the
availability of the design materials for these systems remains largely
confined to a small number of corporations and research institutions.
Here, we introduce a fully open-source hardware accelerator for vector
similarity searching, based on an array of 21 FPGAs densely intertwined
with 42 GB of high-speed dynamic memory and installed on a
custom-designed compute node board, which yields an aggregate bandwidth
of 33.6 GB/s and can be seamlessly reconfigured to implement nearly
arbitrary distance calculations. A novel logic and software
architecture, based on a lane-wise organization of independent engines
implementing distributed distance calculation and sorting, allows
attaining noteworthy query latency and power consumption performance on
both single- and multi-node system configurations. The entire circuit

inspecting bodies of water, such as lakes and ponds is a research area
of growing interest. However, using real aquatic vehicles to test and
develop software and control systems is often not feasible for many
researchers, due to the limited access to testing pools and the lack of
availability of low-cost, off-the-shelf surface vehicles. An alternative
is to utilise software simulations, but these can fail to test important
system features, such as error characteristics of real sensors, on-board
processing and the effect of external disturbances on the performance of
positional control systems. The contribution of the present paper is a
third method that allows the robot's full software system including real
world sensors to be tested without the need for pool facilities. This is
achieved by mapping the physics of an omnidirectional aquatic surface
robot onto an omnidirectional ground vehicle. A dynamic model of the
aquatic surface vehicle is deployed within an embedded control system on
the ground vehicle, meaning that for a given command signal ( applied
force) the motion of the ground vehicle mimics the motion that would
occur if it were a surface vehicle floating on a body of water.
Validation tests demonstrate that the ground vehicle's dynamic behaviour
matches well with that of a specific aquatic surface vehicle that was
utilised in this study. However, by changing the dynamic model within
the embedded control system, the ground vehicle is able to approximate
the motion of any aquatic surface vehicle. The newly constructed ground
robot is now an open-source and open-hardware platform.}",,{182-186},,,{2019},,"{Embodiment of an Aquatic Surface Vehicle in an Omnidirectional Ground

communication is virtually impossible, being reduced to communicating
with their eyes or using sophisticated systems that translate thoughts

suitable systems for those people but their main drawback is their cost.
More affordable devices are capable of detecting voluntary blinks and
translating them into a binary signal that allows the selection, for
example, of an ideogram on a communication board. We tested four
different systems based on infrared, bioelectrical signals
(Electro-Oculography (EOG) and Electro-Encephalography (EEG)), and video
processing. The experiments were performed by people with/without
disabilities and analyzed the systems' performances, usability, and
method of voluntary blinking (long blinks or sequence of two short
blinks). The best accuracy (99.3\%) was obtained using
Infrared-Oculography (IR-OG) and the worst with the EEG headset (85.9\%)
and there was a statistical influence of the technology on accuracy.
Regarding the method of voluntary blinking, the use of long or double
blinks had no statistical influence on accuracy, excluding EOG, and the
time taken to perform double blinks was shorter, resulting in a
potentially much faster interface. People with disabilities obtained
similar values but with greater variability. The preferred technology
and blinking methods were Video-Oculography (VOG) and long blinks,
respectively. The several Open-Source Hardware (MEW) devices have been

number of wells to be used as small test tubes in cell-culture studies.
In most of the low-budget mammalian cell study laboratories, highly
skilled laboratory personnel should determine microscopic changes in
microplate well media by taking the microplate outside the incubator and
by imaging each well medium under a microscope, with the risk of
contamination and reliability degrading. An alternative solution is to
use an in-incubator operated live-cell imaging device, which, however,
cannot be afforded by low-cost laboratories. In this paper, we present
the design, realization, and test stages of a microplate compatible
inverted bright-field microscope system that can be used in incubators.
The developed system enables real-time and long-term in-incubator
imaging of any user-selectable microplate type. The device can capture
bright-field microscopic images by using a low-cost CMOS image sensor,
an inverted varifocal CCTV lens and an array of light emitting diodes.
In addition, by developed two-axial movement stage and image augmenting
algorithms, the whole area of a user selectable well (e.g. area of a 6.5
mm diameter well in a 96-well plate) can be automatically imaged without
using any other third party software. The long-term performance of the

Peer-production and contribution cultures are enfolded in a dynamic of
resistance and appropriation in relation to capitalism. Open-source and

towards bureaucracy or becoming enfolded in a never-ending neoliberal
imaginary from which escape or transcendence become impossible. An
examination of the values expressed within a peer-production community
challenges these perspectives and shows how ``operational pragmatics{''}
can provide moral justifications through reference to matters of
principle and matters of design. Conflating these matters complicates
claims about the inherent virtues of participation, especially in
technical cultures. A qualitative analysis of an open-source hardware

environments. Rapid advancements in electronic technologies in the last
few decades, as well as more recent widespread proliferation and
adoption of electronic sensing and communications, have created many
options to address the needs of professional, as well as amateur,
researchers. In this study, an agricultural research project was
undertaken to collect data and examine the effects of different
agronomic practices on yield, with the objectives being to develop a
monitoring system to measure soil moisture and temperature conditions in
field plots and to upload the data to an internet website. The developed
system included sensor nodes consisting of sensors and electronic
circuitry to read and transmit sensor data via radio and a cellular
gateway to receive node data and forward the data to an internet website
via cellular infrastructure. Microcontroller programs were written to
control the nodes and gateway, and an internet website was configured to
receive and display sensor data. The battery-powered sensor nodes cost
\$170 each, including electronic circuitry and sensors, and they were
operated throughout the cropping season with little maintenance on a
single set of batteries. The solar-powered gateway cost \$163 to
fabricate, plus an additional cost of \$2 per month for cellular network
access. Wireless and cellular data transmissions were reliable,
successfully transferring 95\% of sensor data to the internet website.
Application of open-source hardware, wireless data transfer, and
internet-based data access therefore offers many options and advantages
for agricultural sensing and monitoring efforts.}",{DEC},,{4},{7},{2018},{JOURNAL OF SENSOR AND ACTUATOR NETWORKS},{Open-Source Wireless Cloud-Connected Agricultural Sensor Network},"Fisher, Daniel K. and Woodruff, Lisa K. and Anapalli, Saseendran S. and

different improvements such as: the possibility of remote updates using
Over-the-Air (OTA) updates; autonomy, using 3G connectivity, a solar
panel, and applied energy strategies to prolong its life; and
replicability, because it is made up of open hardware and other elements
such as 3D-printed pieces. The node is validated in the field of smart

because it maintains the detailed product information and tells us in
which stockroom the product is present. The warehouse inventory
management system is playing a significant aspect in many productions
and goods based methodology. Though there are many wireless
communication technologies the RFID suits the best for the warehouse
inventory management system. The tag information is transferred from the
transmitter section to open source hardware via a wireless link with the
aid of internet. The warehouse inventory management system built on the
architecture of the Internet of Things is developed to track the
products attached to the tags with product information and their
respective time stamps for further verification. The Raspberry Pi acts

area where such low-cost technology is needed is to characterize thin

holder to the user specified angle where two stepper motors control the
motion providing two degrees of freedom. The sample holder is made in
such a way that samples can easily be mounted on it by two movable
latches. The system was validated and characterized for: i)
unidirectional accuracy, ii) repeatability, iii) backlash, iv) speed
resolution and v) microstep size. Finally, the mechatronic system is
tested for the intended application using a halogen light source and a
spectrometer to measure transmission through glass TCO samples through a

the open source gimbal system performed adequately while measuring

intellectual property management extending the principles of Open Source
Software (OSS) to the domain of physical products. These principles
support the development of products in transparent processes allowing
the participation of any interested person. While increasing numbers of
products have been released as OSH, little is known on the prevalence of
participative development practices in this emerging field. It remains
unclear to which extent the transparent and participatory processes
known from software reached hardware product development. To fill this
gap, this paper applies repository mining techniques to investigate the
transparency and workload distribution of 105 OSH product development
projects. The results highlight a certain heterogeneity of practices
filling a continuum between public and private development settings.
They reveal different organizational patterns with different levels of
centralization and distribution. Nonetheless, they clearly indicate the
expansion of the open source development model from software into the
realms of physical products and provide the first large-scale empirical
evidence of this recent evolution. Therewith, this article gives body to
an emerging phenomenon and contributes to give it a place in the

techniques to investigate them in further detail as well as a large

on two System on Chip (SoC) solutions and Raspberry PI, implementing
both a full three-lead ECG recorder and an impedance cardiographer, for

biopotential is the ADAS1000, and for the EBI measurement is the AD5933.
The recordings were wirelessly transmitted through Bluetooth to a PC,
where the waveforms were displayed, and hemodynamic parameters such as
heart rate, stroke volume, ejection time and cardiac output were
extracted from the ICG and ECG recordings. These results show how
Raspberry PI can be used for quick prototyping using relatively widely

Although there have been a large number of works done in the field of
traffic data collection, there are several barriers which restrict the
collection of traffic data at higher resolution in the cities.
Installation and maintenance costs can act as a disincentive to use
existing methods (e.g., loop detectors, video analysis) at a large scale
and hence limit their deployment to only a few roads of the city. This
paper presents an approach for vehicle counting using a low cost, simple
and easily installable system. In the proposed system, vehicles (i.e.,
bicycles, cars, trucks) are counted by means of variations in the WiFi
signals. Experiments with the developed hardware in two different
scenarios-low traffic (i.e., 400 objects) and heavy traffic roads (i.e.,
1000 objects)-demonstrate its ability to detect cars and trucks. The

diagnostic contrasts and thermal therapies, RF pulses for MR spin
excitation can be deliberately used to apply a thermal stimulus. This
application requires dedicated transmit/receive (Tx/Rx) switches that
support high peak powers for MRI and high average powers for RF heating.
To meet this goal, we propose a high-performance Tx/Rx switch based on
positive-intrinsic-negative diodes and quarter-wavelength (lambda/4)
stubs.
Methods: The lambda/4 stubs in the proposed Tx/Rx switch design route
the transmitted RF signal directly to the RF coil/antenna without
passing through any electronic components (e.g.,
positive-intrinsic-negative diodes). Bench measurements, MRI, MR
thermometry, and RF heating experiments were performed at f = 297 MHz
(B-0 = 7 T) to examine the characteristics and applicability of the
switch.
Results: The proposed design provided an isolation of -235.7dB/-241.5dB
during transmission/reception. The insertion loss was -20.41dB/-20.27dB
during transmission/reception. The switch supports high peak (3.9 kW)
and high average (120 W) RF powers for MRI and RF heating at f = 297
MHz. High-resolution MRI of the wrist yielded image quality competitive
with that obtained with a conventional Tx/Rx switch. Radiofrequency
heating in phantom monitored by MR thermometry demonstrated the switch
applicability for thermal modulation. Upon these findings, thermally
activated release of a model drug attached to thermoresponsive polymers
was demonstrated.
Conclusion: The high-power Tx/Rx switch enables thermal MR applications
at 7 T, contributing to the study of the role of temperature in
biological systems and diseases. All design files of the switch will be
made available open source at www.opensourceimaging.org.}",{NOV},{2246-2255},{5},{80},{2018},{MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE},"{High peak and high average radiofrequency power transmit/receive switch

UAV platform properties such as functionality, reliability, fault

controller hardware and software. The lack of standardization of flight
controller architectures and the use of proprietary closed-source flight
controllers on many UAV platforms, however, complicates this work:
solutions developed for one flight controller may be difficult to port
to another without substantial extra development and testing. Using
open-source flight controllers mitigates some of these challenges and
enables other researchers to validate and build upon existing research.

two decades, their applications to industrial instruments, vehicles, and

the field of lab-on-a-chip research and technology has seen major
technological leaps towards sample handling, sample preparation, and

from a laboratory based lab-on-a-chip technology to actual point-of-care

that becomes available with open source microcontrollers, especially
when embedded in easy-to-use development environments, such as the

between lab-on-a-chip technology and real-life point of care

microcontrollers, namely within computation, communication, and

as a very active and fast moving community of makers, who are eager to

dreadful chip-in-a-lab-situation, and the next successful start-up. Here

based on the performance of experts and nonexperts is presented. The
system uses computer vision, augmented reality, and artificial
intelligence algorithms, implemented into a Raspberry Pi board with
Python programming language. Methods. Two training tasks were evaluated
by the laparoscopic system: transferring and pattern cutting. Computer
vision libraries were used to obtain the number of transferred points
and simulated pattern cutting trace by means of tracking of the
laparoscopic instrument. An artificial neural network (ANN) was trained
to learn from experts and nonexperts' behavior for pattern cutting task,
whereas the assessment of transferring task was performed using a
preestablished threshold. Four expert surgeons in laparoscopic surgery,
from hospital Raymundo Abarca Alarcon, constituted the experienced class
for the ANN. Sixteen trainees (10 medical students and 6 residents)
without laparoscopic surgical skills and limited experience in minimal
invasive techniques from School of Medicine at Universidad Autonoma de
Guerrero constituted the nonexperienced class. Data from participants
performing 5 daily repetitions for each task during 5 days were used to
build the ANN. Results. The participants tend to improve their learning
curve and dexterity with this laparoscopic training system. The
classifier shows mean accuracy and receiver operating characteristic
curve of 90.98\% and 0.93, respectively. Moreover, the ANN was able to
evaluate the psychomotor skills of users into 2 classes: experienced or
nonexperienced. Conclusion. We constructed and evaluated an affordable

This is done using the capabilities of the Programmable System on a Chip

necessary electrical components. This is in contrast to other recent
papers that have developed potentiostats but require technical skills or
specialized equipment to produce. This eliminates the process of having
to make a printed circuit board and soldering on electronic components.
To control the device, a graphical user interface (GUI) was developed in
the python programming language. Python is open source, with a style
that makes it easy to read and write programs, making it an ideal choice
for open source projects. As the developed device is open source and
based on a PSoC, modification to implement other electrochemical
techniques is straightforward and only requires modest programming
skills, but no expensive equipment or difficult techniques. The
potentiostat developed here adds to the growing amount of open source
laboratory equipment. To demonstrate the PSoC potentiostat in a wide
range of applications, we performed cyclic voltammetry (to measure
vitamin C concentration in orange juice), amperometry (to measure

are well-established, the potential for system-scale control of

stormwater system can be leveraged to shape streamflow within an urban
watershed. Specifically, we coordinate releases from two
internet-controlled stormwater basins to achieve desired control
objectives downstream such as maintaining the flow at a set-point, and
generating interleaved waves. In the first part of the study, we
describe the construction of the control network using a low-cost,
open-source hardware stack and a cloud-based controller scheduling
application. Next, we characterize the system's control capabilities by
determining the travel times, decay times, and magnitudes of various
waves released from the upstream retention basins. With this
characterization in hand, we use the system to generate two desired
responses at a critical downstream junction. First, we generate a
set-point hydrograph, in which flow is maintained at an approximately
constant rate. Next, we generate a series of overlapping and interleaved
waves using timed releases from both retention basins. We discuss how
these control strategies can be used to stabilize flows, thereby
mitigating streambed erosion and reducing contaminant loads into

fabrication processes, integrated circuits are becoming increasingly
vulnerable to malicious attacks. The most concerning threats are
hardware trojans. A hardware trojan is a malicious inclusion or
alteration to the existing design of an integrated circuit, with the
possible effects ranging from leakage of sensitive information to the
complete destruction of the integrated circuit itself. While the
majority of existing detection schemes focus on test-time, they all
require expensive methodologies to detect hardware trojans.
Off-the-shelf approaches have often been overlooked due to limited
hardware resources and detection accuracy. With the advances in
technologies and the democratisation of open-source hardware, however,
these tools enable the detection of hardware trojans at reduced costs
during or after production. In this manuscript, a hardware trojan is
created and emulated on a consumer FPGA board. The experiments to detect
the trojan in a dormant and active state are made using off-the-shelf
technologies taking advantage of different techniques such as Power
Analysis Reports, Side Channel Analysis and Thermal Measurements.
Furthermore, multiple attempts to detect the trojan are demonstrated and
benchmarked. Our simulations result in a state-of-the-art methodology to

respects. However, their computational demands are also growing, which
constraints their use in mobile and time-sensitive robots. Biological
vision presents a well known practical solution. Specifically, primates
limit the computational demands of vision by processing only small parts
of the scene in detail, and frequently reorienting the eyes to different
locations. Artificial vision is much more power-intensive than
biological vision, so this strategy is likely to be increasingly
relevant to robots, as they become more visually sophisticated. To
facilitate progress and reduce duplication of work in this area, we have
developed a 7-degree-of-freedom robotic head that supports such rapid
saccade-like camera movements, and we are releasing the design files
under an open-hardware license. The system supports C-mount cameras,
large foveated lenses, and liquid lenses that allow rapid changes in
focus distance. It also has a stereo baseline that is roughly the same
as that of humans, to support stereo processing of nearby objects in
grasping and manipulation tasks. The main contributions of this work are
the mechanical design, and the demonstration that its stereo baseline,
range of motion, and saccade velocity are similar to those of primate
systems. The main general advantages over existing robotic heads are
speed and the open-hardware license. The system would also be an ideal

differential-drive robots) from a centralized computer, you need to
control them in the same way even if the robots come from different

same type of sensors and the same type of control commands. Currently,
if we need to add sensors on a robot, we should first find out what are
the hardware capabilities and what are the tools provided by the
manufacturer (some have microcontrollers, others have ARM processors).
The protocol to communicate with the onboard card (often a serial
protocol) is different for each robot and we have to take that in
account in our software so that the robots can be interchangeable.
This paper describes the design and the results of using a standard
interface (bridge) on a robot which allows wireless communication with a
centralized computer and local serial communication with a mobile robot.
On this interface, we can connect every sensor we want (infrared,
ultrasound, laser, Kinect etc.) and we can always use the same tools to
control them.
Extension of the protocol of the Kobuki base (TurtleBot 2) is proposed
to be able to use the same type of frame as the TurtleBot 2 uses and to
continue to use ROS middleware as is, but with the possibility to use
data from new sensors implemented on the bridge. This article will focus
on the use of the TurtleBot 2, but the same bridge will be adapted to

limited funding resources, researchers and students are often unable to
access or purchase the ideal equipment for their projects. In the fields
of materials science and mechanical engineering, fundamental equipment
such as tensile testing devices can cost tens to hundreds of thousands
of dollars. While a research lab often has access to a large-scale
testing machine suitable for conventional samples, loading devices for
meso-and micro-scale samples for in-situ testing with the myriad of
microscopy tools are often hard to source and cost prohibitive.
Open-source software has allowed for great strides in the reduction of
costs associated with software development and open-source hardware and
additive manufacturing have the potential to similarly reduce the costs
of scientific equipment and increase the accessibility of scientific
research. To investigate the feasibility of open-source hardware, a
micro-tensile tester was designed with a freely accessible
computer-aided design package and manufactured with a desktop 3D-printer
and off-the-shelf components. To our knowledge this is one of the first
demonstrations of a tensile tester with additively manufactured
components for scientific research. The capabilities of the tensile
tester were demonstrated by investigating the mechanical properties of
Graphene Oxide (GO) paper and thin films. A 3D printed tensile tester
was successfully used in conjunction with an atomic force microscope to
provide one of the first quantitative measurements of GO thin film
buckling under compression. The tensile tester was also used in
conjunction with an atomic force microscope to observe the change in
surface topology of a GO paper in response to increasing tensile strain.
No significant change in surface topology was observed in contrast to
prior hypotheses from the literature. Based on this result obtained with
the new open source tensile stage we propose an alternative hypothesis
we term `superlamellae consolidation' to explain the initial deformation
of GO paper. The additively manufactured tensile tester tested
represents cost savings of > 99\% compared to commercial solutions in
its class and offers simple customization. However, continued
development is needed for the tensile tester presented here to approach
the technical specifications achievable with commercial solutions.}",{MAY 29},,{5},{13},{2018},{PLOS ONE},"{Open-source micro-tensile testers via additive manufacturing for the

monitoring equipment currently inhibits full ground-level coverage of
many natural systems. Developments over the last decade in technology,
open science, and the sharing economy promise to bring global access to
more versatile and more affordable monitoring tools, to improve coverage
for conservation researchers and managers.
2. Here we describe the development and proof-of-concept of a low-cost,
small-sized and low-energy acoustic detector: ``AudioMoth.{''} The
device is open-source and programmable, with diverse applications for
recording animal calls or human activity at sample rates of up to 384
kHz. We briefly outline two ongoing real-world case studies of
large-scale, long-term monitoring for biodiversity and exploitation of
natural resources. These studies demonstrate the potential for AudioMoth
to enable a substantial shift away from passive continuous recording by
individual devices, towards smart detection by networks of devices
flooding large and inaccessible ecosystems.
3. The case studies demonstrate one of the smart capabilities of
AudioMoth, to trigger event logging on the basis of classification
algorithms that identify specific acoustic events. An algorithm to
trigger recordings of the New Forest cicada (Cicadetta montana)
demonstrates the potential for AudioMoth to vastly improve the spatial
and temporal coverage of surveys for the presence of cryptic animals. An
algorithm for logging gunshot events has potential to identify a shotgun
blast in tropical rainforest at distances of up to 500 m, extending to 1
km with continuous recording.
4. AudioMoth is more energy efficient than currently available passive
acoustic monitoring devices, giving it considerably greater portability
and longevity in the field with smaller batteries. At a build cost of
similar to US\$43 per unit, AudioMoth has potential for varied
applications in large-scale, long-term acoustic surveys. With continuing
developments in smart, energy-efficient algorithms and diminishing
component costs, we are approaching the milestone of local communities
being able to afford to remotely monitor their own natural resources.}",{MAY},{1199-1211},{5},{9},{2018},{METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},"{AudioMoth: Evaluation of a smart open acoustic device for monitoring

blackened aluminum disk is used as a hot junction, and the cold junction
is exposed to ambient air. The two terminals are connected to a digital
amplifier with output signal directed to an Arduino board. A device
calibration was performed by comparing the results with a commercial
photodiode sensor. Statistical analysis of the calibration data
considering a 99\% confidence level leads to an estimated standard error
of 20.8 W/m(2). An analysis of its response time also estimated from a
dynamic model. This model uses a numerical solution of the energy
balance on heat exchange between the aluminum disc and the environment.
The instrument response time based on the average of the estimates
obtained from the dynamic model is about 1.5 minutes. Based on these

operational cost and easily scaled processing technique for depositing
thin and uniform films rapidly, while minimizing material waste. The
complex inner geometry of conventional slot dies require expensive
machining that limits accessibility and experimentation. In order to
overcome these issues this study follows an open hardware approach,
which uses an open source 3-D printer to both fabricate the slot die and
then to functionalize a 3-D slot die printing system. Polymer materials
are tested and selected for compatibility with common solvents and used
to fabricate a custom slot die head. This slot die is then integrated
into a 3-D printer augmented with a syringe pump to form an additive
manufacturing platform for thin film semiconductor devices. The full
design of the slot die system is disclosed here using an open source
license including software and operational protocols. This study
demonstrates that functional lab-grade slot dies may be 3-D printed
using low-cost open source hardware methods A case study using NiO2
found an RMS value 0.486 nm, thickness of 17-49 nm, and a maximum
optical transmission of 99.1\%, which shows this additive manufacturing
approach to slot die depositions as well of fabrication is capable of
producing viable layers of advanced electronic materials. Using this
method, a cost savings of over 17,000\% was obtained when compared to
commercial slot die systems for laboratories. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All

indicators is introduced to differentiate between congestion levels and
handle them accordingly. Second, a feedback-based rate controller is
developed to maximize received video quality, in which sensor nodes can
adaptively adjust their sending rates. Finally, a different
retransmission mechanism for different packets is proposed. Lost packets
can be stored temporarily and resend when free channel is available to
avoid congestion. The core component of IVSP is an open source hardware
platform, which is based on Raspberry Pi sensor nodes. IVSP is
extensively evaluated on 7 Raspberry Pi sensor nodes. We present the

challenge to date. The well-known simultaneous localization and mapping
problem of mobile robots has been addressed in the literaturewithout
specifically taking into account the robot's motion control tasks.
Moreover, its implementation can cost more than the robot itself. Robot
motion control strategies developed in the literature either 1) rely on
sophisticated hardware platforms, 2) assume noise-free environment, or
3) are based on abstract theories, which are validated using computer
simulations only. The current work solves the navigation and mapping

in this work is customized such that it is cost-effective and
easy-to-implement, addressing the aforementioned issues in developing
motion control strategies. The current strategy permits the robot to
estimate its position and orientation and builds a map of its operating
environment using radio frequency signals received from radio sources.
It then navigates through a path defined by a set of two-dimensional
points on the ground using a motion control strategy in cooperation with

constraint faced by the majority of MANET (Mobile Ad-hoc Network)

experimental studies that are costlier, in favour of opting for cheaper
simulation tools instead. While simulation tools provide a simple and
inexpensive method to gain an understanding of algorithms and protocols
in MANET research, its reliability and accuracy in representing real
systems and contexts are critically limited. Thus, this paper unveils
the ToMRobot, created with low budget using ordinary remote control (RC)
car coupled with a few low cost electronic components, to serve as a
fully functional MANET testbed. Provided in this paper are practical
knowhow to model and produce ToMRobot from scratch specifically targeted
to facilitate less technical savvy MANET researchers. Despite being
really economical, significantly inexpensive to create, highly
customizable with flexible option that allows researchers to upgrade by
utilizing components such as Arduino and Cubieboard2 from technologies
that can be sourced from open hardware, ToMRobot still maintains all
aspects of MANET rudimentary structures. It is hoped that the guidelines

Despite the recent popularity of the RISC-V architecture, there is
currently very little support for performing architectural experiments
of high performance RISC-V devices designed to target high performance
computing and high performance analytics applications. Further, there
are no general purpose simulation infrastructures that support
developing architectural experiments using RISC-V cores coupled to
emerging memory devices such as HBM and HMC. As a result, there is
currently a significant gap for those seeking to develop high
performance architectural models using emerging memory devices and the
RISC-V instruction set.
The Stake infrastructure is designed to provide integrated simulation
capabilities that supports experimentation using RISC-V processing cores
as well as emerging memory devices. Stake is constructed using a fusion
of the existing RISC-V Spike functional simulation infrastructure
coupled to a custom memory generation component within the Sandia
Structural Simulation (SST) framework. The result being an integrated
simulation infrastructure that has the ability to simulate heterogeneous
mixtures of hierarchical caches, traditional DRAM memories and emerging
memory devices. We demonstrate this infrastructure with a design study
to elicit the efficacy of 64 bit RISC-V cores on executing graph
applications using different mixtures of cache, DRAM memories and HMC
memories. In this study, we utilize the Graph Analytics Benchmark Suite
to drive simulated memory traffic into mixtures of single level and
multi-level caches coupled to each of the aforementioned backend memory
devices. From this, we determine that in our simulated architecture, the
HMC memory configuration with a single (L1) caching layer provides the
most advantageous system configuration for executing graph algorithms
and applications.}",,{365-376},,,{2018},,{Stake: A Coupled Simulation Environment for RISC-V Memory Experiments},"Leidel, John D.",inproceedings,ISI:000473509400038,,,,,,,"{Rambus; Arm; Intel; Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab; Micron; Northrop

as, it searches that the students learn a second programming language,
using hands-on designs and activities that require the components
mentioned. In addition, the methodology has been employed into the
curriculum of a course of programming known as (open hardware) for
students of technology in electronics (n=22), observing that the
students learn programming concepts in a better way and their motivation
and engagement towards the software area was increased during the
course. To technical level, the methodology uses the programming
language Python in order to interact with the different ports,
peripherals and utilities of the platforms mentioned, creating a link
between these elements and the aspects concerning the software design,
e.g., data types, classes, methods or Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs).
Finally, the methodology takes into account two important aspects,
firstly, the skills developed by the students in the proposal are
involved into the BoK (Body of Knowledge) of different engineering areas
as embedded systems, control and computer science and, secondly,
programming is perhaps one of the most difficult areas in engineering

multiple industrialists. Robots are faster, more accurate, less
error-prone and cost-effective when compared to human beings. For big
companies, it is estimated that by 2025, labor cost savings from the
adoption of advanced industrial robots would surpass 20\%. However, for
small and medium companies, industrial robots are still expensive and
unaffordable. Fortunately, with the advent of Internet of Things (IoT),
artificial intelligence, open source hardware and software, and the
declining price of electronic components, a new generation of smaller,
cheaper and friendlier robots are emerging, for small and medium
businesses. In this paper, we propose the simulation of an Indoor
Positioning System (IPS) robot, which performs a forklift operation in a
warehouse. The system uses Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
technology, and Java programming language for exchanging data from a
server. An ESP8266 NodeMCU module, an Arduino microcontroller and
various components such as MFRC522 to read RFID tags, Ultrasonic Sensors
HC-SR04 for detecting obstacles are used. This resulted in a very low
cost, reliable and multifunctional system. Simulations have demonstrated
that the mobile robot can transmit packets over the network to a local
server for mapping without losses. Moreover, it can receive packets from
the server to obtain destination points and mapping obstacles while
moving around the RFID tagged floor.}",,{986-991},,,{2018},,"{Indoor Positioning System Simulation for a Robot using Radio Frequency

Technology, Engineering and Mathematics - STEM for high school students
is growing. Within this context, the need for solutions that decreases
the overall cost of hardware is mandatory. In this work, a 25 euros
Android-based mobile robot that allows connecting a smartphone to
different robot ``bodies{''} (each composed by different hardware:
Arduino, LEGO, etc.) is proposed, targeting mainly high school students.
The mobile platform was built using 3D printed parts and uses an Arduino
board to control the servos used for the locomotion. To communicate with
the Android application, a Bluetooth module is also used. The Android
application takes advantage of the smartphone camera and has some
pre-implemented image processing modules, allowing actions such as
coloured line following, colour proximity detection and coloured object
tracking. Another import feature present in the Android application is
its coding capability, thanks to an embedded code interpreter. This
feature was implemented using BeanShell, a lightweight script
interpreter for Java. It allows writing scripts in Java programming
language, which are then executed by the robot. This interpreter also
provides a way for the user to write a set of instructions that defines
the behaviour of the robot, primarily by checking the current status of
the sensors and the smartphone camera, and manipulating the velocity of
the motors.
All of the necessary components (3D source CAD + STLs) of the mobile
platform presented here are available online, enabling the recreation of
a replica of the robot body. A detailed list of electronic components
and its connections are also provided, as well as the Arduino source
code along with the installation file needed for the Android
application. All the necessary information can be accessed at:
https://github.com/ee09115/squirlrob.
The high school students are then challenged to solve classical robotics
tasks like line following, obstacle avoidance, and using the virtual
sensors to create new challenges.
By providing this set of tools (Android app, source code, 3D CAD models,
documentation), a promotion of knowledge is expected, thus developing
enthusiast students in robotics multidisciplinary fields, such as
mechanical designing, electronics designing, mathematics, coding, etc.
(in short, all the relevant STEM areas).
Finally, a general analysis of the usability, interoperability and
feature extension capacity is made, always taking into consideration the

algorithm was done in terms of response time and oscillations around the

several problems such as increased transportation costs and high
corrosion rate due to dissolved salts. Indirect low frequency ultrasonic
energy (US), using baths, has been recently proposed as an effective
alternative for crude oil demulsification. However, the reactor position
during sonication and its influence on the demulsification efficiency
for crude oil has not been evaluated. In this sense, the aim of this
study was to develop an automated system based on an open source
hardware for mapping the acoustic field distribution in an US bath
operating at 35 kHz using a hydrophone. Data acquired with this system
provided information to evaluate the demulsification efficiency in the
different positions of the US bath and correlate it with the acoustic
intensity distribution. The automated 3D-mapping system revealed a
higher acoustic intensity in the regions immediately above the
transducers (ca. 0.6 W cm(-2)), while the other regions presented a
relatively lower intensity (ca. 0.1 W cm(-2)). Experimental data
demonstrated that reactors positioned in the most intense acoustic
regions provided a much higher efficiency of demulsificadon in
comparison with the ones positioned in the less intense acoustic field
regions. Demulsification efficiency up to 93\% was obtained with 15 min
of sonication (100\% amplitude) using few amount of chemical
demulsifier. Hence, this work demonstrated that the information acquired
with the developed mapping system could be used for inducing a higher
efficiency of demulsification only by finding the more suitable position
of reactor in the US bath, which certainly will help development of
appropriate reactors design when looking for such approach.}",{JAN},{53-59},"{B, SI}",{40},{2018},{ULTRASONICS SONOCHEMISTRY},"{Intensification of ultrasonic-assisted crude oil demulsification based

athletes in sport sciences. Flight time measurement with jump-mat
systems is the most common procedure for this purpose. The aim of this
study was to analyze the concurrent validity and reliability of two
proprietary systems (Globus and Axon) and an open-source system
(Chronojump). Methods: A conditioning electric circuit governed by a
controlled wave generator is designed to substitute athletes jumping on
a physical mat. In order to look for possible differences associated to
timekeeping by each microcontroller device, all three systems are fed by
the circuit simultaneously. Results: Concurrent validity was high for
the three systems. Standarized typical error of estimate (TEE) was
trivial, according to MBI interpretation as well as perfect Pearson
correlation coefficient. Reliability was assessed based on the
coefficient of variation of flight time measure, resulting in
0.17-0.63\% (0.05-0.12 cm) for Globus, 0.01\% (0.09 cm) for Chronojump
and 5.65-9.38\% (2.15-3.53 cm) for Axon. These results show that all
jump-mat system produced nearly identical measures of flight time so
they can be considered valid and reliable for practical purposes. In
comparison, Chronojump showed the best performance whereas Axon showed
enough variability and disagreement to pose a problem in testing elite
athletes. Conclusions: These experiments show that open-source jump mats
are as valid and reliable as their proprietary counterparts at a lower
cost. Therefore, practitioners can be confident in using Globus or
Chronojump systems to test athletes' jump height because of their
negligible errors and Axon system to monitor general population.}",,{51-57},{3},{20},{2018},{ACTA OF BIOENGINEERING AND BIOMECHANICS},"{Concurrent validity and reliability of proprietary and open-source jump

classrooms is a reality for many teachers. These professionals have a
favourable attitude towards the inclusion of pupils with SEN in the
regular teaching classrooms.
An inclusive education system should be ``structured and developed
taking into account the diversity of characteristics of young children,
different needs or problems{''} and for these reasons to differentiate
measures.
Special education is aimed at educational and social inclusion,
educational access and success, autonomy, emotional stability, as well
as the promotion of equal opportunities, preparation for continuing
education or adequate preparation for the professional life and for a
transition from school to employment of children and young people with
permanent special educational needs{''}.
A particular case of SEN is that of people with autism, and they
characterize autism as ``a rare and serious psychiatric illness in
childhood and characterized by imbalanced intellectual development that
affects the ability to socialize.{''} It is also reported in the
literature that these people, with autism, have great difficulties in
communicating verbal and nonverbal, while having a great difficulty in
interpreting language.
Technology-based learning, in particular through the use of visual and
multimedia environments, is a facilitating tool for people with autism
spectrum disorders to learn best when information is presented visually.
This view is also shared by several authors when refer that to
facilitate ``inclusion and children / young people with SEN in today's
society, Information and Communication Technologies play a fundamental
role, as they facilitate a differentiated, active and collaborative
intervention of all stakeholders in the life of each of these
people{''}.
This document reports on an activity project that can be used by
Educators of students with autism. Two tools are used, Makey-Makey
hardware and Scratch software. The use of open-hardware
microcontrollers, with no need for programming and free software, allows
this project to be shared and reconverted to other topics. This work
arose from a challenge of proposing an activity to be used by children
with special educational needs using ICT. In a first step the
bibliography related to the use of ICT in the classroom with these
children and the legislation that served to obtain the first
orientations was consulted. Then a specialist was consulted and then the
prototype of the project was built, succinct enough that it could be
replicated and perceived by these Educators.}",,{1834-1843},,,{2018},,{GAMEYOU: DESIGNING ACTIVITIES USING SCRATCH AND A MICROCONTROLLER},"Rito, Pedro Neves",inproceedings,ISI:000447408801130,,,,"{Rito, Pedro/0000-0002-4507-0323}","{Rito, Pedro/AAE-1271-2020}",,,"{12th International Technology, Education and Development Conference

Researchers and support organizations that are affiliated with the Army
Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center
(AMRDEC) are developing nano based structures and components for
advanced weaponry, aviation, and autonomous air/ground systems
applications. The first key area consists of determining in-plane and
out-of-plane shear properties of test articles made by 3D printing
(Fused Deposition Modeling - FDM) and comparing to the conventional
extrusion/forming sheet process. Test specimens are made from three
polymer materials: acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), high impact
poly-styrene (HIPS), and poly-lactic acid (PLA). Laboratory testing is
performed according to the ASTM D3846-02 method for determining the
in-plane shear strength, while the ASTM D5379 method is used for
determining the out-of-plane shear properties. A description on how the
3D printing process advances the shear properties and has the potential
of improving the in-plane and cross-sectional shear properties over the
conventional manufacturing process is presented. The second key area
demonstrates a set of materials, processes, and techniques that support
the enabling of additive manufacture (AM) of RF components. Research
activities are focused on developing open-source hardware/software
multi-material direct digital printing, and producing 3D printed
antenna, passive components, and connectors for C-band and Ku-band
systems. Material studies have demonstrated a suitable material set for
RF components and identified key material performance limits. Results
show how more enhancement could be achieved by optimizing the variables

Applicability, and Robustness (CAESAR) was started. It aims at
determining a portfolio of ciphers for authenticated encryption that has
advantages over AES-GCM in terms of performance, security, and ease of
implementation. This competition, for the first time, provides a
standardized hardware API, which allows a fair comparison of hardware
implementations. However, the community still lacks a common platform to
automatically test hardware implementations, confirm implementation
claims, and benchmark performance figures on real hardware in terms of
runtime, area, power and energy consumption. In this work, we present a
common platform using the CAESAR-API in a Xilinx Zynq-7000 System on
Chip (SoC) with ARM processors and an AXI interface. This reflects a
typical real world usage scenario for hardware-accelerators and thus
extends the work for a fair comparison of hardware implementations in
three dimensions: first the API is evaluated on a real SoC, which shows,
e.g. the performance of the API. Second, it provides a hardware platform
to test the proposed implementations of the candidates easily. This can
be used by future designers, as we will provide it as open source
hardware. Finally, we ran all published hardware implementations of the
current 3rd-round candidates during which we identified several
implementation weaknesses, e.g. presumably unintended latches in the
design, hence emphasizing the importance of testing hardware proposals
on real hardware.}",,{73-80},,,{2018},,"{The CAESAR-API in the Real World - Towards a Fair Evaluation of Hardware

geology, amplifying the ground motion, especially in soft soils. This
amplification is connected with the resonant frequency, which can be
estimated applying the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (1-1/V)
method on seismic noise measurements. In this work, a low-cost
user-friendly data acquisition system (Geophonino-3D) has been designed
for three-component seismic noise recording. The developed system
consists of the signal conditioning circuit and the Arduino Due with an
SD Shield for data storage. The suitability of the equipment for the
application of the H/V method has been first assessed in the laboratory,
according to the experimental sensitivity, the internal noise stability
and the channel consistency. Subsequently, experimental verification has
been carried out by recording seismic noise at eight different sites
along the province of Alicante (southeast Spain), with different soil
characteristics. The performance of the developed acquisition system has
been evaluated in terms of the power spectral density and the H/V peaks
by comparison with the results obtained through a commercial seismic
recorder. The obtained results show the applicability of the developed
acquisition system to record seismic noise and to apply the H/V method.
Geophonino-3D is an open source and open hardware system and the price
of its components is much lower than any other commercial equipment,

the design process by creating a novel reconfigurable testbed called

e.g., power conversion, energy storing and power routing. This interface
results in a clear layout because power and status pins are strictly
separated, and inputs and outputs have fixed positions. Medlay is the
ready-to-use and open-hardware platform based on the interface. It
consists of a base board and small modules incorporating e.g., dc-dc
converters, power switches and supercapacitors. Measurements confirm
that Medlay represents a system on one circuit board, as parasitic
effects of the interconnections are negligible. The versatility
regarding different setups on the testbed is determined to over 250,000
combinations by layout graph grammar. Lastly, we underline the
applicability by recreating three state-of-the-art systems with the
testbed. In conclusion, Medlay facilitates building and testing power

Revenue Registry Act was adopted in the Czech Republic. The first and
main reason for introducing the revenue registry was the lack of
instruments of the Tax Administration to fight tax evasions. The second
reason was the elimination of unfair competition based on gain of undue
advantage by not paying the value added tax (VAT) and the income tax.
The system of the revenue registry in the Czech Republic is founded on
several principles that distinguish it from other systems based on a
cash register or other systems of electronic evidence. The revenue
registry is based on the principles of electronisation, on-line access
of tax administrator to information, the possibility of voluntary public
involvement into oversight and open hardware and software solution.
Unfortunately, shortly after the adoption by the Parliament, the group
of legislators started a case at the Constitutional Court, demanding the
abolition of the Revenue Registry Act or at least some parts of the Act
because of its unconstitutionality. They were partially successful and
now the Ministry of Finance has been tasked with the preparation of an
amendment to the Act. The goal of this contribution is to briefly
introduce and describe the Revenue Registry Act, critically analyse the
fundamental provisions of the Act, summarize pros and cons of the
regulation, critically analyse the decision of the Constitutional Court
and introduce the Ministry's proposal of amendments. The hypothesis that
the electronic revenue registry is an effective tool for fair tax
payments was neither confirmed nor disproved: The electronic revenue
registry might be an effective tool for fair tax payments, but only in
case of unified rules for all businessmen. The higher the number of
exemptions is, the less effective tool the revenue registry is.}",,{333-339},,,{2018},,{ELECTRONIC REVENUE REGISTRY AS A TOOL FOR FAIR TAX PAYMENTS},"Radvan, Michal",inproceedings,ISI:000506077900029,,,,,,,"{Voronezh State Univ, Law Fac, Financial Law Dept}","{International Conference on Financial Law: Tax Sovereignty and the

custom, high-voltage, floating electronics. In this report we detail the
operation and performance characteristics of a wifi-enabled,
MOSFET-based pulser design that uses a lithium-polymer battery and does
not require high voltage isolation transformers. Currently, each output
of this circuit follows a TTL signal with similar to 20 ns rise and fall

the development of inexpensive scientific devices and laboratory

low-cost and open-source hardware, software and genetic resources. The
multi-fluorescence imaging system consists of readily available 470 nm
LEDs, a Raspberry Pi camera and a set of filters made with low cost
acrylics. This device allows imaging in scales ranging from single
colonies to entire plates. We developed a set of genetic components
(e.g. promoters, coding sequences, terminators) and vectors following
the standard framework of Golden Gate, which allowed the fabrication of
genetic constructs in a combinatorial, low cost and robust manner. In
order to provide simultaneous imaging of multiple wavelength signals, we
screened a series of long stokes shift fluorescent proteins that could
be combined with cyan/green fluorescent proteins. We found CyOFP1,
mBeRFP and sfGFP to be the most compatible set for 3-channel fluorescent
imaging. We developed open source Python code to operate the hardware to
run time-lapse experiments with automated control of illumination and
camera and a Python module to analyze data and extract meaningful
biological information. To demonstrate the potential application of this
integral system, we tested its performance on a diverse range of imaging
assays often used in disciplines such as microbial ecology, microbiology
and synthetic biology. We also assessed its potential use in a high

contact with different materials and contact with the human body. As
such, distributing these sensors across a robot's body could be
beneficial for operation in human environments. We present a stretchable
fabric-based skin with force and thermal sensors that is suitable for
covering areas of a robot's body, including curved surfaces. It also
adds a layer of compliance that conforms to manipulated objects,
improving thermal sensing. Our open hardware design addresses thermal
sensing challenges, such as the time to heat the sensors, the efficiency
of sensing, and the distribution of sensors across the skin. It
incorporates small self-heated temperature sensors on the surface of the
skin that directly make contact with objects, improving the sensors'
response times. Our approach seeks to fully cover the robot's body with
large force sensors, but treats temperature sensors as small, point-like
sensors sparsely distributed across the skin. We present a mathematical
model to help predict how many of these point-like temperature sensors
should be used in order to increase the likelihood of them making
contact with an object. To evaluate our design, we conducted tests in
which a robot arm used a cylindrical end effector covered with skin to
slide objects and press on objects made from four different materials.
After assessing the safety of our design, we also had the robot make
contact with the forearms and clothed shoulders of 10 human
participants. With 2.0 s of contact, the actively-heated temperature
sensors enabled binary classification accuracy over 90\% for the
majority of material pairs. The system could more rapidly distinguish
between materials with large differences in their thermal effusivities
(e.g., 90\% accuracy for pine wood vs. aluminum with 0.5 s of contact).
For discrimination between humans vs. the four materials, the skin's
force and thermal sensing modalities achieved 93\% classification
accuracy with 0.5 s of contact. Overall, our results suggest that our

multiple channels in a manner such that the time of day at which each
sample is taken is known. This allows measurements taken at multiple

wide area electrical power system measurements, in particular phasor
measurement units (PMUs). The novelty of the authors' design is the
application of an open hardware development platform to discipline a
commodity analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to a broadcast time signal,
usually but not exclusively GPS. The methodology used creates a driver
layer for the ADC to achieve real-time sampling in a nonpreemptive Linux
environment. The use of open hardware and software addresses the need
for a transparent instrument for use in research and development of PMU
technology. Through a choice of either a software or hardware
phase-locked loop, the ADC is controlled to acquire exactly 256 samples
per nominal power system cycle (i. e., 50/60 Hz), precisely time
synchronized to GPS, at 16-b resolution and 94.2-dB SNR. The design of a
printed circuit board expansion board featuring all necessary components
is provided. The performance of the system is evaluated.
Interoperability and data exchange with other systems is achieved by use

conditioned on the state of the system under investigation, have become
increasingly common in neuroscience. Such experiments can have a high
degree of explanatory power, but they require a precise implementation
that can be difficult to replicate across laboratories. We sought to
overcome this limitation by building open-source software that makes it
easier to develop and share algorithms for closed-loop control.
Approach. We created the Open Ephys GUI, an opensource platform for
multichannel electrophysiology experiments. In addition to the standard
`open-loop' visualization and recording functionality, the GUI also
includes modules for delivering feedback in response to events detected
in the incoming data stream. Importantly, these modules can be built and
shared as plugins, which makes it possible for users to extend the
functionality of the GUI through a simple API, without having to
understand the inner workings of the entire application. Main results.
In combination with low-cost, open-source hardware for amplifying and
digitizing neural signals, the GUI has been used for closedloop
experiments that perturb the hippocampal theta rhythm in a
phase-specific manner. Significance. The Open Ephys GUI is the first
widely used application for multichannel electrophysiology that
leverages a plugin-based workflow. We hope that it will lower the
barrier to entry for electrophysiologists who wish to incorporate
real-time feedback into their research.}",{AUG},,{4},{14},{2017},{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING},"{Open Ephys: an open-source, plugin-based platform for multichannel

important tools not only in compliance testing of industrial chemicals
and plant protection products, but also in the monitoring of
environmental quality. With few exceptions, such test systems are
discontinuous. They require exposure of the biological test material in
small units, such as multiwell plates, during prolonged incubation
periods, and do not allow online read-outs. It is mostly due to these
shortcomings that applications in continuous monitoring of, e.g.,
drinking or surface water quality are largely missing. We propose the
use of pipetting robots that can be used to automatically exchange
samples in multiwell plates with fresh samples in a semi-static manner,
as a potential solution to overcome these limitations. In this study, we
developed a simple and low-cost, versatile pipetting robot constructed
partly using open source hardware that has a small footprint and can be
used for online monitoring of water quality by means of an automated
whole-organism bioassay. We tested its precision in automated 2-fold
dilution series and used it for exposure of zebrafish embryos (Danio
rerio) a common model species in ecotoxicology to cadmium chloride and
permethrin. We found that, compared to conventional static or
semi-static exposure scenarios, effects of the two chemicals in
zebrafish embryos generally occurred at lower concentrations, and
analytically verified that the increased frequency of media exchange
resulted in a greater availability of the chemical. In combination with
advanced detection systems this custom-made pipetting robot has the

problems and the inspection of components such as absorber tubes in
parabolic trough concentrators (PTC), which are widely deployed, is
necessary to guarantee plant efficiency. This article presents a system
for real-time industrial inspection of CSP plants using low-cost,
open-source components in conjunction with a thermographic sensor and an
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The system, available in open-source
hardware and software, is designed to be employed independently of the
type of device used for inspection (laptop, smartphone, tablet or
smartglasses) and its operating system. Several UAV flight missions were
programmed as follows: flight altitudes at 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 m
above ground level; and three cruising speeds: 5, 7 and 10 m/s. These
settings were chosen and analyzed in order to optimize inspection time.
The results indicate that it is possible to perform inspections by an
UAV in real time at CSP plants as a means of detecting anomalous
absorber tubes and improving the effectiveness of methodologies
currently being utilized. Moreover, aside from thermographic sensors,
this contribution can be applied to other sensors and can be used in a

platform to readout microwave multiplexed X-ray TES. ROACH is an
open-source hardware and software platform featuring a large Xilinx
Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), Power PC processor, several 10 GB
Ethernet SFP+ interfaces, and a collection of daughter boards for analog
signal generation and acquisition. The combination of a ROACH board,
ADC/DAC conversion daughter boards, and hardware for RF mixing allows
for the generation and capture of multiple RF tones for reading out
microwave multiplexed X-ray TES microcalorimeters. The FPGA is used to
generate multiple tones in base band, from 10 MHz to 250 MHz, which are
subsequently mixed to RF in the multiple GHz range and sent through the
microwave multiplexer. The tones are generated in theFPGAby storing a
large lookup table in Quad Data Rate SRAM modules and playing out the
waveform to a DAC board. Once the signal has been modulated to RF,
passed through the microwave multiplexer, and has been modulated back to
base band, the signal is digitized by an ADC board. The tones are
modulated to 0 Hz by using a FPGA circuit consisting of a polyphase
filter bank, several Xilinx FFT blocks, Xilinx CORDIC blocks (for
converting to magnitude and phase), and special phase accumulator
circuit for mixing to exactly 0 Hz. Upwards of 256 channels can be
simultaneously captured and written into a bank of 256
First-In-First-Out (FIFO) memories, with each FIFO corresponding to a
channel. Individual channel data can be further processed in the FPGA
before being streamed through a 10 GB Ethernet fiber-optic interface to
a Linux system. The Linux system runs software written in Python and QT
C++ for controlling the ROACH system, capturing data, and processing

First, we used Openspritzer to deliver precise amounts of reagents to

accelerated in a lot of fields such as databases, image processing, and
genome analysis. Given that advent of Internet of Things (IoT) era due
to mobile technology progressions, the future needs a sorting method
that is available on any environment, such as not only high performance
systems like servers but also low computational performance machines
like embedded systems. In this paper, we present an FPGA-based sorting
accelerator combining Sorting Network and Merge Sorter Tree, which is
customizable by means of tuning design parameters. The proposed FPGA
accelerator sorts data sent from a host PC via the PCIe bus, and sends
back the fully sorted data sequence to it. We also present a detailed
analytical model that accurately estimates the sorting performance. Due
to these characteristics, designers can know how fast a developed
sorting hardware is in advance and can implement the best one to fulfill
the cost and performance constraints. Our experiments show that the
proposed hardware achieves up to 19.5x sorting performance, compared
with Intel Core i7-3770K operating at 3.50GHz, when sorting 256M 32-bits
integer elements. However, this result is limited because of
insufficient memory bandwidth. To overcome this problem, we propose a
data compression mechanism and the experimental result shows that the
sorting hardware with it achieves almost 90\% of the estimated
performance, while the hardware without it does about 60\%. In order to
allow every designer to easily and freely use this accelerator, the RTL
source code is released as open-source hardware.}",{MAY},{1003-1015},{5},{E100D},{2017},{IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS},"{A High Performance FPGA-Based Sorting Accelerator with a Data

our understanding and attachment to them is rather limited. One way to
support stronger end users' engagement with such complex technologies is
by involving them in the design process and, with the advent of Arduino

the potential for stronger user engagement with physical artifacts, we
know little about end users' DIY practice of making complex electronic
technologies and their potential to ensure engagement with such devices.
In this article, we report on interviews with 18 participants from two
green communities who built and used an open source DIY energy monitor,
with the aim to explore the end users DIY practices of making such
complex electronic devices. Findings indicate four key qualities of DIY
monitors: transparent modularity, open-endedness, heirloom, and
disruptiveness, and how they contribute to more meaningful engagement
with the DIY monitors, elevating them from the status of unremarkable
objects to that of things. We conclude with three implications for
design for supporting end user development of complex electronic DIY:
designing transparent open hardware technologies, standardizing

for future medical applications. However, entering this field of
research is difficult since such an implant requires components from
many different areas of technology. Since the complete avoidance of

This raises the question if it is possible to create a reusable design

groups to use it as a starting point. In this article, we try to answer
this question by presenting a design based exclusively on commercial
off-the-shelf components and studying the properties of the resulting

interconnectivity in the traditional Internet; and piggybacking on the
success of IP, 6LoWPAN has been the first standardized technology to
realize it for networks of resource-constrained devices. In the recent
past Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) a.k.a Bluetooth Smart - a subset of the

However, BLE is a closed standard and lacks open hardware and firmware
support, something that hinders innovation and development in this
field. In this article, we aim to overcome some of the constraints in
BLE's core building blocks by making three contributions: first, we
present the design of a new open hardware platform for BLE; second, we

mobile sensor network in cities at fine spatial resolution was developed
and tested. First, a com-pact, mobile system was built using an infrared
gas analyzer combined with open-source hardware to control,
georeference, and log measurements of CO2 mixing ratios on ve-hicles
(car, bicycles). Second, two measurement campaigns, one in summer and
one in winter (heating season) were carried out. Five mobile sensors
were deployed within a 1x12.7 km transect across the city of Vancouver,
BC, Canada. The sensors were operated for 3.5 h on pre-defined routes to
map CO2 mixing ratios at street level, which were then averaged to 100 x
100m grid cells. The averaged CO2 mixing ratios of all grids in the
study area were 417.9 ppm in summer and 442.5 ppm in winter. In both
campaigns, mixing ratios were highest in the grid cells of the downtown
core and along arterial roads and lowest in parks and well vegetated
residential areas. Third, an aerodynamic resistance approach to
calculating emissions was used to derive CO2 emissions from the gridded
CO2 mixing ratio mea-surements in conjunction with mixing ratios and
fluxes collected from a 28 m tall eddycovariance tower located within
the study area. These measured emissions showed a range of 12 to
226CO(2) ha 1 h 1 in summer and of -14 to 163 kgCO(2) ha 1 h 1 in
winter, with an average of 35.1 kgCO(2) ha (-1) h (-1) (summer) and 25.9
kgCO(2) ha 1 h 1 (winter). Fourth, an independent emissions inventory
was developed for the study area using buildings energy simulations from
a previous study and routinely available traffic counts. The emissions
inventory for the same area averaged to 22.06 kgCO(2) ha (-1) h (-1)
(summer) and 28.76 kgCO(2) ha (-1) h (-1) (winter) and was used to
compare against the measured emissions from the mobile sensor network.
The comparison on a grid-by-grid basis showed linearity between CO2
mixing ratios and the emissions inventory (R (2) =53 in summer and R (2)
= 47 in winter). Also, 87\% (summer) and 94\% (winter) of measured grid
cells show a difference within +/- 1 order of magnitude, and 49\%
(summer) and 69\% (winter) show an error of less than a factor 2.
Although associated with considerable errors at the individual grid cell
level, the study demonstrates a promising method of using a network of
mobile sensors and an aerody-namic resistance approach to rapidly map
greenhouse gases at high spatial resolution across cities. The method
could be improved by longer measurements and a refined calculation of
the aerodynamic resistance.}",{MAR 1},{1-21},{2},{10},{2017},{ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES},"{A mobile sensor network to map carbon dioxide emissions in urban

supply. Thermal desorption modulation (TDM) was attained using a
dual-stage heater-based modulator in a novel segmented-loop
configuration. TDM was achieved by alternating analyte trapping and
thermal desorption. Former process relied on analyte partition to
sorbent phase, while latter explored direct resistive heating.
Introduction of an intermediate delay segment between the two stages
mitigated analyte breakthrough, improving peak symmetry and
chromatographic efficiency. This feature was critical to acquire
reliable GCxGC modulation using such simple heater-based device. The
effects of important modulation variables on 2D separations were
investigated, including TDM stage length, dimension of delay loop, and
outlet pressure. Significant advances and limitations of proposed TDM
strategy were carefully determined. Proposed GCxGC prototype by using an
in-oven TDM modulator was successfully applied to a series of
challenging matrices, including petroleum distillates, biodiesel, and
essential oil. This open-hardware, cost-effective modulator was easy to
install and operate, as it circumvented the need for sophisticated

increasingly being used in several fields. In this study, as a first
step a 3d printer is constructed by modifying open source hardware and
controlled by improving open source software. Subsequently, an ankle
foot orthosis (AFO) is designed and constructed by using this 3d
printer.
The ankle foot orthosis, very important for human walking, is designed
to control motion of the ankle and prevents deformities. An AFO can
generally be used for following purposes: brace weak limbs, grasp ankle
and foot in the right position and correct the foot drop. Since the
users have different sizes of ankles and different types of deformities,
an AFO must be produced to match in size to the end-user. Therefore
off-the-shelf AFOs may not suitable for the each end user. Considering
these factors, 3d printers are of great importance for producing
individualized biomedical equipment. In this study, a distinctive ankle
foot orthosis is first modelled by using CAD software and then produced
by using constructed 3d printer. This AFO is the first ankle foot
orthosis produced by a 3d printer in the literature of our country. This
study is a proof that biomedical equipments can be produced in a shorter
time and less costly by using 3d printers.}",{MAR},{1-8},{1},{20},{2017},{JOURNAL OF POLYTECHNIC-POLITEKNIK DERGISI},"{Design and Construction of Ankle Foot Orthosis By Means Of Three

was then compared to two commercial proprietary systems. Results of
resistors from 10 to 1 M show errors of less than 1\% for the OS4PP. The
3-D mapping of sheet resistance of ITO samples successfully demonstrated
the automated capability to measure non-uniformities in large-area

environmental monitoring devices that more effectively express their
experiences and address gaps in regulation? This paper describes and
shows the results of a novel method of visualizing environmental
emissions of corrosive gases such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S) exposure
using photographic paper. H2S is a neurotoxic and flammable gas that
smells like rotten eggs and is frequently associated with oil and
natural gas extraction. Communities living with oil and gas development
in Wyoming report odors of rotten eggs and describe symptoms of H2S
exposure. H2S is recognized as an acute and chronic threat to human and
environmental health and oil and gas companies are required to have
plans in place to prevent and respond to accidental, high concentration
releases of H2S. They are not, however, required to monitor, report or
prevent routine daily emissions. Yet 15-25\% of the oil and gas wells in
the US are predicted to contain H2S, and some communities surrounded by
multiple wells report chronic, routine exposure. Chronic exposure is
difficult to represent with current tools for monitoring H2S because
they are designed to measure acute workplace exposure. Informed by STS
theories of black boxes and regimes of imperceptibility that focus on
the need to revise not only regulations but also material tools of
science, this paper describes the development of an indexical approach
to visualizing this hazard. In indexical design, the reactive sensing
element of a scientific instrument is brought to the foreground. The
silver in the photopaper is an index as it tarnishes with H2S exposure.
Discolored tests strips can be arranged together to form data-rich maps
of the exposure landscape where this discoloration both represents how
the gas spreads through a space and is a physical trace of the gas.
Preliminary results in the form of data-rich maps show that regulating
H2S emissions as primarily accidental is inappropriate and fails to
adequately protect human health.}",,{426-463},,{3},{2017},{ENGAGING SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY},"{Materializing Exposure: Developing an Indexical Method to Visualize

issue for food production. An understanding of whether the soil is
adequately treated with appropriate crop management practices in
real-time during production cycles could prevent soil erosion and the
overuse of natural or artificial resources to keep the soil healthy and
suitable for planting. Precision agriculture traditionally uses
expensive techniques to monitor the health of soil and crops including
images from satellites and airplanes. Recently there are several studies
using drones and a multitude of sensors connected to farm machinery to
observe and measure the health of soil and crops during planting and
harvesting. This paper describes a real-time, in-situ agricultural
internet of things (IoT) device designed to monitor the state of the
soil and the environment. This device was designed to be compatible with
open hardware and it is composed of temperature and humidity sensors
(soil and environment), electrical conductivity of the soil and
luminosity, Global Positioning System (GPS) and a ZigBee radio for data
communication. The field trial involved soil testing and measurements of
the local climate in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The measurements of soil
temperature, humidity and conductivity are used to monitor soil
conditions. The local climate data could be used to support decisions
about irrigation and other activities related to crop health. On-going
research includes methods to reduce the consumption of energy and
increase the number of sensors. Future applications include the use of
the IoT device to detect fire in crops, a common problem in sugar cane

engaged in production, often supported by digital systems and networks,
can be a powerful tool in humanitarian aid. Field Ready uses distributed
manufacturing to produce essential non-food items locally where they are
needed during humanitarian responses. Such supplies can be available to
communities in need and to relief workers more quickly, more cheaply
than alternatives, and provide appropriate solutions to problems, often
engaging local people in designing and making necessary items, and
supporting economic development. Scaling up this requires local
production capabilities (skills, tools, and information such as
designs), which can be boosted by adoption of these methods by aid
agencies, international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) and
others. Local manufacturing offers the potential for disaster affected
communities to be engaged in recovery, and long term to become more
resilient, with access to all the equipment and information required to
make the supplies they need. However, there are challenges: appropriate
quality control for distributed manufacture, unlocking the potential for
in-region manufacturers to engage in humanitarian response, and uptake
of digital knowledge sharing and collaboration to the humanitarian
sector. In this paper, we share experiences of human-centred design and

designing it as an educational-oriented equipment. This approach is
two-fold: as an AFM-unexperienced user discovering its principle of
operation at nanoscale or as a future engineer understanding its

Moore's Law and the rising costs of chip design and verification
(millions of dollars today). Heterogeneous IPs - cores and
domain-specific accelerators - are a promising answer to the first
challenge, enabling performance and energy benefits no longer provided
by technology scaling. IP-reuse with plug-and-play designs can help with
the second challenge, amortizing NRE costs tremendously. A key
requirement in a heterogeneous IP-based plug-and-play SoC environment is
an interconnection fabric to connect these IPs together. This fabric
needs to be scalable - low latency, low energy and low area - and yet be
flexible/parametrizable for use across designs. The key scalability
challenge in any Network-on-Chip (NoC) today is that the latency
increases proportional to the number of hops.
In this work, we present a NoC generator called OpenSMART, which
generates low-latency NoCs based on SMART(1). SMART is a recently
proposed NoC microarchitecture that enables multi-hop on-chip traversals
within a single cycle, removing the dependence of latency on hops. SMART
leverages wire delay of the underlying repeated wires, and augments each
router with the ability to request and setup bypass paths. OpenSMART
takes SMART from a NoC optimization to a design methodology for SoCs,
enabling users to generate verified RTL for a class of user-specified
network configurations, such as network size, topology, routing
algorithm, number of VCs/buffers, router pipeline stages, and so on.
OpenSMART also provides the ability to generate any heterogeneous
topology with low and high-radix routers and optimized single-stage
pipelines, leveraging fast logic delays in technology nodes today.
OpenSMART v1.0 comes with both Bluespec System Verilog and Chisel
implementations, and this paper also presents a case study of our
experiences with both languages. OpenSMART is available for download(2)
and is going to be a key addition to the emerging open-source hardware
movement, providing a glue for interconnecting existing and emerging
IPs.}",,{195-204},,,{2017},,{OpenSMART: Single-Cycle Multi-hop NoC Generator in BSV and Chisel},"Kwon, Hyoukjun and Krishna, Tushar",inproceedings,ISI:000426905600028,,,,,"{Kwon, Hyoukjun/AAD-8374-2020}",,"{IEEE; IEEE Comp Soc; NSF; IEEE TCCA; IEEE TCuARCH; Microsoft; ARM;

this work, a set of RF sensors utilizing the ZigBee protocol are placed
in an indoor environment and a base RF sensor is mounted within a
rotating parabolic reflector on a mobile robot. The proposed range and
bearing approximation framework works in two cascaded phases. In the
first phase, the base RF sensor sends an RF signal to all other RF
sensors within its operating range. These RF sensors then respond to the
base RF module where ZigBee packets are parsed to store raw data for
approximating range. In the second phase, a stepper motor is employed to
rotate the parabolic reflector and the base RF sensor mounted on the
robot. These two phases continue until a full revolution of 360 degrees
has been achieved. The data is processed for approximating the bearing
of each RF sensor with respect to the mobile robot's heading angle, as
well as the distance (range) to the RF sensor at its associated bearing.

permits researchers, educators, and students to share designs arising
from their different perspectives, with the potential to expand
educational applications. In this paper we present a family of open

previous educational haptic device, Hapkit 3.0. First, we discuss
methods for Hapkit personalization and customization that can be
achieved by K-12 students and educators. Next, we describe two
kinesthetic haptic device designs that evolved from the original Hapkit
3.0. One uses two standard Hapkits with additional components to form a
Pantograph mechanism, and the other uses customized Hapkit elements
along with a novel kinematic design to form a serial mechanism. These
designs are modular; after building two Hapkits, a user acquires a small
number of additional parts to transform them into a
two-degree-of-freedom device. The Pantograph mechanism was used in an
undergraduate class to teach robotics and haptics to both engineering

minimally supervised gesture recognition system which identifies static
gestures efficiently and accurately. The proposed system uses ADXL335
accelerometer sensors which track the gestures and these sensors are
interfaced with an Arduino ATMega 2560 micro-controller for data
processing and gesture recognition. The software of the system
implemented in the micro-controller, features a computationally feasible
algorithm which requires only nominal resources to recognize the
gestures. The paper further elucidates on minimizing the number of
accelerometers to reduce the cost and power-consumption of the system.
The performance of the system is assessed using static gestures in the
alphabets of the American Sign Language (ASL) across data-sets obtained
from 3 trained ASL signers. The average run-time efficiency of the
proposed system with a maximum and minimum configuration of 5 and 2
accelerometers was found to be 95.3\% and 87.0\%, with the cost of these
prototype systems being realized at 20 USD and 12.5 USD respectively. It
was also found that the system can be trained for the static gestures of

promising theoretical concepts such as real-time moving horizon
estimation (MHE) and non-linear model predictive control (NMPC) on
hardware developed in parallel. As experimental setups for testing new
control algorithms tend to be fine-tuned by trial and error methods, a
rapid control prototyping system for fast evaluation had to be
implemented. Technical results of this research are presented in the
form of a modular platform for real-time control.
The created platform provides a complete toolchain for performing,
observing and evaluating control experiments. It offers modular low-cost
hardware and free software especially suited for flight control
experiments. Clearly defined interfaces between the components allow for
expanding on its current capabilities for other control scenarios in
need of fast and reliable real-time control. The provided modularity
allows for spatial separation of high performance computing hardware
from low-level components, permits rapid reconfiguration of the

(1) evaluating the degree with which Chisel, an existing HCL, can
support powerfully parameterized libraries, and (2) introducing the
concept and implementation of an HCF that uses an open-source hardware
intermediate representation, FIRRTL (Flexible Intermediate

framework to explain these motivations, where each level of the
framework has been defined, explained and illustrated with

by two categories in the paper: 1) Intrinsic Motivation, which describes
the motivations of an entrepreneur as an individual, who needs personal

end-toend LPWAN architecture built using LoRa Wide-Area Network
(LoRaWAN) with the goal of simplifying the design and deployment of
Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices across wide areas like campuses and
cities. We present a software architecture that exposes an application
layer allowing users to register devices, describe transducer
properties, transfer data and retrieve historical values. We define a
service model on top of LoRaWAN that acts as a session layer to provide
basic encoding and syntax to raw data streams. At the device-level, we
introduce and benchmark an open-source hardware platform that uses
Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) to help provision LoRa clients that can be
extended with custom transducers. We evaluate the system in terms of
end-node energy consumption, radio penetration into buildings as well as
coverage provided by a network currently deployed at Carnegie Mellon

following a do-it-yourself (DIY) approach. This platform is composed of
three main components: a blueprint to build the hardware prototype with
very simple materials and regular tools; a software development kit
(SDK) to help with the development of new applications (e.g. augmented
reality app); and, finally, a second SDK (ControlWear) to interact with
mobile applications through a Smartwatch.
Design/methodology/approach - User experiments were conducted, in which
participants were asked to create, by themselves, the CARTON's hardware
part and perform usability tests with their own creation. A second round
of experimentation was conducted to evaluate three different interaction
modalities.
Findings - Qualitative user feedback and quantitative results prove that
CARTON is functional and feasible to anyone, without specific skills.
The results also showed that ControlWear had the most positive results,
compared with the other interaction modalities, and that user
interaction preference would vary depending on the task.
Originality/value - The authors describe a novel way to create a smart

levelling plate of fused deposition modelling (FDM) additive
manufacturing (AM) systems. This automatic levelling system is presented
as an evolution of actual systems, which uses a new ultrasound sensing
system.
Design/methodology/approach - After obtaining a prototype, different
tests were conducted for getting a system which solves the level plate
problem and can be mounted in any FDM AM machine. Several benchmark
models were obtained and compared with current equipment concepts for
the validity of the product.
Findings - All tests were performed with high accuracy, enabling the
production of geometries that could not have been achieved without this
novel system.
Practical implications - This development will enable experienced users
to set aside the problems of calibration and focus on the purpose of
this type of machines, making prototypes.
Originality/value - A system architecture has been developed and
integrated into an open hardware AM system, allowing real-time
adjustment of the plate during each layer, thus eliminating the need of
levelling the plate, allowing to achieve easier printing, and without
increasing the cost significantly.}",,{401-413},{2},{23},{2017},{RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL},{Plate auto-level system for fused deposition modelling (FDM) 3D printers},"Soriano Heras, Enrique and Blaya Haro, Fernando and de Agustin del

Area Network system that simulates electronic controls in modern
automotive vehicles and to evaluate its effectiveness as a teaching aid.
The Arduino UNO microcontroller hoard was chosen as the desired hardware
platform and the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) using
the Arduino compiler was chosen as the software development environment.
Both the Arduino Uno and Arduino IDE/compiler are open source and freely
available to students and staff with no proprietary intellectual
property costs.
The Arduino UNO was interfaced with the Arduino Controller Area Network
Bus (CANBus) shield which is also open hardware. Unitec Institute of
Technology practices a holistic approach to teaching. As part of its
holistic approach to teaching, senior students are encouraged to develop
technical artefacts that can be used as teaching aids for junior
students, the junior students are introduced to the artefact as part of
their course and the artefact is used to encourage junior students to
increase their technical proficiency so that when they reach a senior
technical level they can develop artefacts too. The holistic approach is
considered to he self-sustaining and provides positive role modelling
for junior students. The project described in this paper was developed
by a senior student and has been used as a teaching aid for junior
students congruent with the holistic teaching philosophy practiced at
Unitec. The code and circuitry was designed by an exchange Masters
student and was used in the papers, APTE 7504 Vehicle Electronic
Diagnostics and APTE 6505 Automotive Electronics, to help students

photosynthetic activity within cnidarian/dinoflagellate symbioses.
Fluorescence measurement is typically achieved by utilizing a blue or
red monochromatic excitation light source. However, algal photosynthetic
pigments can differ in their absorption spectra, potentially leading to
excitation wavelength dependent measurements of maximal and light
acclimated PSII photosynthetic quantum yield (Fv/Fm or Fq'/Fm') and
functional absorption cross section (sigma(PSII) or sigma(PSII)). Here
we utilized an open source hardware development platform to construct a
multispectral excitation fluorometer to assess spectrally dependent
differences in photochemistry within four different Symbiodinium species
(two of each ITS2-type A4 and B1). Multivariate analysis of light
acclimated photochemical signatures showed separation between most alga
types. These spectrally dependent differences in light acclimated PSII
efficiency and PSII functional absorption cross section likely reflect
changes in light harvesting compounds, their connectivity to the PSII
reaction centers and the balance between photochemical and
non-photochemical fluorescence quenching. Additionally, acclimation to
low (20 iLmol photons M-2 s(-1)) and high (200 mu mol photons m(-2)
s(-1)) light conditions was examined in two of these symbionts types
(ITS-2 type A4 and B1) As expected, chlorophyll a cell(-1) decreased
under high light acclimation in both symbionts. However, only A4 saw a
subsequent reduction in absorbance whereas cellular volume decreased in
the B1 (S. minutum) symbiont. In response to high light acclimation,
Fv/Fm was significantly lower at all excitation wavelengths for the B1
symbiont where as efficiencies remained the same for A4. However,
high-light acclimated Fq'/Fm' levels decreased in both symbionts, but
only when measured using the 615 or 625 nm excitation wavelengths.
Non-photochemical quenching within the antennae bed was downregulated
under high light acclimation in the A4 symbiont, but only when measured
using the 505 and 530 nm excitation wavelengths. Such changes in Fq'/Fm'
and antennae bed quenching highlight the benefits of spectrally resolved
photochemical measurements. Additionally, the utilization of Arduino and
Bitscope hardware exemplifies the potential of open source development
platforms for construction of highly customizable instrumentation for
photosynthetic research.}",,,,{4},{2017},{FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},"{Use of Open Source Hardware and Software Platforms to Quantify

and expensive. Development of UUVs has been driven by defense and
commercial requirements. This has allowed for extensive research and
development budgets and long development cycles. This paper briefly
discuses these historic drivers and how this situation has changed. It
focuses on a new compact affordable UUV.
In 2015, several veterans of the conventional UUV sector set out to
change the dynamics of the industry, founding Riptide Autonomous
Solutions. Riptide's first offering was the micro-UUV, a new, highly
flexible, open source autonomous undersea vehicle. The micro-UUV
features open hardware and software interfaces giving users a reliable
and robust platform to advance technology development. The vehicle
design is optimized for high efficiency with the best hydrodynamic
signature in its class. The base micro-UUV is 4 7/8 inches in diameter,
40 inches in length and weighs 22 lbs. The standard system is rated to a
depth of 300 meters.
This paper discuses the technical details of this UUV that make it
distinctive and enabled its rapid development. The entire system was
taken from design to initial delivery in under 12 months. Flexible and
open software interfaces and use of modern three dimensional design and
printing are key enablers of the rapid development. A highly optimized
hydrodynamic design improves the speed and endurance of the vehicle, as
does its compact size. Reducing control fins from the typical four to
three reduces drag and enables active roll control steering, a further
enhancement of the micro-UUV's performance. In addition to describing
the novel features and approach of the micro-UUV design this paper will
discuss the potential for a new aluminum seawater battery to extend the
range of this compact vehicle to nearly 1000km.}",,,,,{2017},,{Rapid Development and Evolution of a Micro-UUV},"Manley, Justin E. and Smith, Jeff",inproceedings,ISI:000455012000096,,,,,,,,"{Conference on OCEANS, Anchorage, AK, SEP 18-21, 2017}",,{OCEANS 2017 - ANCHORAGE},{IEEE},,{OCEANS-IEEE},,,,

the trend of wind turbine upsizing. Consequently, the risk of blades
breakage by hitting the tower has increased. In order to prevent such
incidents, this study proposes a deflection monitoring system that can
be installed to already operating wind turbine's blades. The monitoring
system is composed of an estimation algorithm to detect blade deflection
and a wireless sensor network as a hardware equipment. As for the
estimation method for blade deflection, a strain-based estimation
algorithm and an objective function for optimal sensor arrangement are
proposed. Strain-based estimation algorithm is using a linear
correlation between strain and deflections, which can be expressed in a
form of a transformation matrix. The objective function includes the
terms of strain sensitivity and condition number of the transformation
matrix between strain and deflection. In order to calculate the
objective function, a simplified experimental model of the blade is
constructed by interpolating the mode shape of a blade from modal
testing. The interpolation method is effective considering a practical
use to operating wind turbines' blades since it is not necessary to
establish a finite element model of a blade. On the other hand, a sensor
network with wireless connection with an open source hardware is
developed. It is installed to a 300 W scale wind turbine and vibration
of the blade on operation is investigated. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

The feasibility of the measurement instrument was tested both in

shown that the instrument provides reliable and robust count rate
estimation over a wide reactor power range based on the third order
statistics of the fission chamber signal. In addition, the system is
able to identify whether the measured count rate change is due to the
malfunction of the detector or due to the change in the neutron flux.
The applied self-monitoring method is based on the spectral properties

the field scale. The structure of the device is flexible and can be
adapted to host different types of sensors. The results, obtained
managing irrigation in a peach orchard, show that adoption of the
device, together with a simple irrigation scheduling criterion, allowed
a significant increase of water use efficiency without causing a
reduction of the quantity and quality of crop production. Copyright (C)

foamability, beer color and bubble size. This study describes the
development of an affordable and robust robotic beer pourer using
low-cost sensors, Arduino (R) boards, Lego (R) building blocks and servo
motors for prototyping. The RoboBEER is also coupled with video capture
capabilities (iPhone 5S) and automated post hoc computer vision analysis
algorithms to assess different parameters based on foamability, bubble
size, alcohol content, temperature, carbon dioxide release and beer
color. Results have shown that parameters obtained from different beers
by only using the RoboBEER can be used for their classification
according to quality and fermentation type. Results were compared to
sensory analysis techniques using principal component analysis (PCA) and
artificial neural networks (ANN) techniques. The PCA from RoboBEER data
explained 73\% of variability within the data. From sensory analysis,
the PCA explained 67\% of the variability and combining RoboBEER and
Sensory data, the PCA explained only 59\% of data variability. The ANN
technique for pattern recognition allowed creating a classification
model from the parameters obtained with RoboBEER, achieving 92.4\%
accuracy in the classification according to quality and fermentation
type, which is consistent with the PCA results using data only from
RoboBEER. The repeatability and objectivity of beer assessment offered
by the RoboBEER could translate into the development of an important
practical tool for food scientists, consumers and retail companies to
determine differences within beers based on the specific parameters

bacteria (FIB) is a mandatory activity in many countries and is key in
public health protection. Despite technological advances and a need for
methodological improvements, chromogenic and fluorogenic enzymatic
techniques remain the mainstays of water quality monitoring for both
public health agencies and regulated utilities. We demonstrated that
bioelectroanalytical approaches to FIB enumeration are possible and can
be achieved using commercially available enzyme-specific resorufin
glycosides, although these are expensive, not widely available or
designed for purpose. Following this, we designed two naphthoquinone
glycosides which performed better, achieving Escherichia coli detection
in the range 5.0x10(2) to 5.0x10(5) CFUml(-1) 22-54\% quicker than
commercially available resorufin glycosides. The molecular design of the
naphthoquinone glycosides requires fewer synthetic steps allowing them
to be produced for as little as US\$50 per kg. Tests with environmental
samples demonstrated the low tendency for abiotic interference and that,
despite specificity being maintained between -glucuronidase and
-galactosidase, accurate enumeration of E.coli in environmental samples
necessitates development of a selective medium. In comparison to a
commercially available detection method, which has U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) approval, our approach performed better at high
organism concentrations, detecting 500 organisms in 9h compared with
13.5h for the commercial method. Bioelectroanalytical detection is
comparable to current approved methods and with further development
could result in improved detection times. A recent trend for low-cost

Lay description The concept of open-source technology stems from the
developmental model of accessibility and ease of use, enabling an
environment of continual improvement and open communication. This
approach has the potential to dramatically change many fields of study
including that of microscope use in research settings. Automated
microscopy is often a challenging and inaccessible field due to the cost
and non-interchangeable stages, the flat plate on which samples are
placed for analysis. This paper presents a low-cost, open source
microscope 3-D stage. A RepRap 3-D printer was converted to an optical
microscope equipped with a customized, 3-D printed holder for a USB
microscope. Precision measurements were determined to have an average
error of 10 ?m at the maximum speed and 27 ?m at the minimum recorded
speed. Accuracy tests yielded an error of 0.15\%. The machine is a true
3-D stage and thus able to operate with USB microscopes or conventional
desktop microscopes. Because it is larger than all current commercial
alternative systems, it is capable of high depth images over
unprecedented areas and complex geometries. The repeatibility is below
2-D microscope stages, but testing shows that it is adequate for the
majority of scientific applications. The open source microscope stage
costs less than 3\% to 9\% of the closest proprietary commercial stages.

biomaterial applications including microfluidics, cell culture
substrates, flexible electronics, and medical devices. However, it has
proved challenging to 3D print PDMS in complex structures due to its low
elastic modulus and need for support during the printing process. Here
we demonstrate the 3D printing of hydrophobic PDMS prepolymer resins
within a hydrophilic Carbopol gel support via freeform reversible
embedding (FRE). In the FRE printing process, the Carbopol support acts
as a Bingham plastic that yields and fluidizes when the syringe tip of
the 3D printer moves through it, but acts as a solid for the PDMS
extruded within it. This, in combination with the immiscibility of
hydrophobic PDMS in the hydrophilic Carbopol, confines the PDMS
prepolymer within the support for curing times up to 72 h while
maintaining dimensional stability. After printing and curing, the
Carbopol support gel releases the embedded PDMS prints by using
phosphate buffered saline solution to reduce the Carbopol yield stress.
As proof-of-concept, we used Sylgard 184 PDMS to 3D print linear and
helical filaments via continuous extrusion and cylindrical and helical
tubes via layer-by-layer fabrication. Importantly, we show that the 3D
printed tubes were manifold and perfusable. The results demonstrate that
hydrophobic polymers with low viscosity and long cure times can be 3D
printed using a hydrophilic support, expanding the range of biomaterials
that can be used in additive manufacturing. Further, by implementing the
technology using low cost open-source hardware and software tools, the
FRE printing technique can be rapidly implemented for research
applications.}",{OCT},{1781-1786},{10},{2},{2016},{ACS BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE \& ENGINEERING},"{3D Printing PDMS Elastomer in a Hydrophilic Support Bath via Freeform

instrumentation amplifier, INA155, which is suitable for low amplitude
signals like the seismic noise, and an anti-aliasing filter based on the
MAX7404 switched-capacitor filter. After that, the amplified and
filtered signal is digitized and processed by Arduino Due and registered
in an SD memory card. Geophonino is configured for continuous
registering, where the sampling frequency, the amplitude gain and the
registering time are user-defined. The complete prototype is an open
source and open hardware system. It has been tested by comparing the
registered signals with the ones obtained through different commercial
data recording systems and different kind of geophones. The obtained
results show good correlation between the tested measurements,
presenting Geophonino as a low-cost alternative system for seismic data

technologies are enabling the capture of more and previously
inaccessible phenomena in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, more
information has not translated into a greater understanding of disease
complexity to satisfy diagnostic and therapeutic needs. Challenges
include noncompatible technology platforms, the need for wide-scale and
long-term deployment of sensor technology (among vulnerable elderly
patients in particular), and the gap between the big data acquired with
sensitive measurement technologies and their limited clinical
application. Major opportunities could be realized if new technologies
are developed as part of open-source and/or open-hardware platforms that
enable multichannel data capture sensitive to the broad range of motor
and nonmotor problems that characterize PD and are adaptable into
self-adjusting, individualized treatment delivery systems. The
International Parkinson and Movement Disorders Society Task Force on
Technology is entrusted to convene engineers, clinicians, researchers,
and patients to promote the development of integrated measurement and
closed-loop therapeutic systems with high patient adherence that also
serve to (1) encourage the adoption of clinico-pathophysiologic
phenotyping and early detection of critical disease milestones, (2)
enhance the tailoring of symptomatic therapy, (3) improve subgroup
targeting of patients for future testing of disease-modifying
treatments, and (4) identify objective biomarkers to improve the
longitudinal tracking of impairments in clinical care and research. This

computer-numerically controlled techniques in biofabrication processes
is quickly becoming an industry standard. However, many hurdles still
exist before these techniques can be used in research laboratories for
cellular and molecular biology applications. Extrusion-based bioprinting
systems have been characterized by high development costs, injector
clogging, difficulty achieving small cell number deposits, decreased
cell viability, and altered cell function post-printing. To circumvent
the high-price barrier to entry of conventional bioprinters, we designed
and 3D printed components for the adaptation of an inexpensive
`off-the-shelf' commercially available 3D printer. We also demonstrate
via goal based computer simulations that the needle geometries of
conventional commercially standardized, `luer-lock' syringe-needle
systems cause many of the issues plaguing conventional bioprinters. To
address these performance limitations we optimized flow within several
microneedle geometries, which revealed a short tapered injector design
with minimal cylindrical needle length was ideal to minimize cell strain
and accretion. We then experimentally quantified these geometries using
pulled glass microcapillary pipettes and our modified, low-cost 3D
printer. This systems performance validated our models exhibiting:
reduced clogging, single cell print resolution, and maintenance of cell
viability without the use of a sacrificial vehicle. Using this system we
show the successful printing of human induced pluripotent stem cells
(hiPSCs) into Geltrex and note their retention of a pluripotent state 7
d post printing. We also show embryoid body differentiation of hiPSC by
injection into differentiation conducive environments, wherein we
observed continuous growth, emergence of various evaginations, and
post-printing gene expression indicative of the presence of all three
germ layers. These data demonstrate an accessible open-source 3D
bioprinter capable of serving the needs of any laboratory interested in

it recommends the learner to relax by delivering modulated sensorial
support in terms of light, sound, or vibration at a relaxation breath

learner can perceive the recommended action without interrupting the
learning activity (in this case, practicing the oral exam of a second

from Libellium e-Health platform with others integrated ad hoc) has been
compared with a commercial system (J\&J Engineering I-330-C2), obtaining
similar outcomes as to identifying significant changes in the
physiological signals when the learner experiments an emotional
reaction. However, the cost of AICARP v2 is much lower, and at the same

the areas that can benefit from this approach are the analysis of
industrial products and effluents and environmental analysis. In this
work, a multi-pumping flow system is proposed for the determination of
phosphorus in effluents and polluted water samples. The system employs
photometric detection based on the formation of molybdovanadophosphoric
acid, and the fluidic circuit is built using three solenoid micropumps.
The detection is implemented with a low cost LED-photodiode photometric
detection system and the whole system is controlled by an open-source
Arduino Uno microcontroller board. The optimization of the timing to
ensure the color development and the pumping cycle is discussed for the
proposed implementation. Experimental results to evaluate the system
behavior are presented verifying a linear relationship between the
relative absorbance and the phosphorus concentrations for levels as high
as 50 mg L-1.}",{APR},{305-309},{3},{39},{2016},{QUIMICA NOVA},"{LOW COST ANALYZER FOR THE DETERMINATION OF PHOSPHORUS BASED ON

share similar characteristics-a pulse whose area is proportional to the

networks of which the number of links of each node is bounded. First, we
analyze the all-terminal reliability of the regular wireless network,
where any two nodes are connected by a wireless link consisting of a
pair of radio modules. The reliability polynomial is derived from the
Tutte polynomial that is the seminal work of the algebraic graph theory.
Second, we analyze the all-terminal reliability of the wireless network
including the random mesh network under the assumption that if the
module fails, all radio links connected through a radio module are cut
off. We consider both the fault of the communication module and the
fading of the wireless channel in the indoor channel condition. For
improving the reliability, we also propose a fault-tolerant method
giving redundant radio modules into each node. We also analyze
cost-effectiveness. We also calculate the mean-time-to-failure (MTTF)

scientific instruments; with the advent of readily available 3D
printers, mechanical designs can now be shared, improved, and replicated
faster and more easily than ever before. However, printed parts are
typically plastic and often perform poorly compared to traditionally
machined mechanisms. We have overcome many of the limitations of 3D
printed mechanisms by exploiting the compliance of the plastic to
produce a monolithic 3D printed flexure translation stage, capable of
sub-micron-scale motion over a range of 8 x 8 x 4 mm. This requires
minimal post-print clean-up and can be automated with readily available
stepper motors. The resulting plastic composite structure is very stiff
and exhibits remarkably low drift, moving less than 20 mu m over the
course of a week, without temperature stabilisation. This enables us to
construct a miniature microscope with excellent mechanical stability,
perfect for time-lapse measurements in situ in an incubator or fume
hood. The ease of manufacture lends itself to use in containment
facilities where disposability is advantageous and to experiments
requiring many microscopes in parallel. High performance mechanisms
based on printed flexures need not be limited to microscopy, and we
anticipate their use in other devices both within the laboratory and

interdisciplinary perspective rather than through the use of existing
technical approaches. Snowball sampling was used in this study to survey
300 people who work and have had experiences with online brand
communities for open source hardware (OSHW) at Fab Lab Seoul. The
findings of this study indicate that content, consumer support, user
interface, and reward are among the five factors that trigger an online
brand community to develop a social OSHW platform. However, this study
also found that brand reputation was insignificant relative to
activating a social media platform for open-source software. In
addition, activating a social platform for OSHW can positively affect to
the brand community's loyalty for OSHW, which means that social platform
innovation for OSHW can help form the positive attitude necessary to
develop and diffuse an OSHW culture in a rapidly changing ICT ecosystem.
This can be an important strategy for OSHW business and can contribute
to the growth of the IoT market in South Korea. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

and to propose one such platform. The platform proposed here is intended
for research which trades smaller population size with more
sophisticated individual robot capabilities. The validation of proposed
swarm robotic algorithms using real-world hardware is essential, but is
fraught with difficulty due to the expense and complexity of developing
and maintaining multiple operational units. A number of open hardware
platforms have been proposed, although most prioritize small size and
low cost over advanced capabilities such as vision. We are interested in
a number of different research directions which utilize vision as a core
capability and find the existing open hardware platforms to be
insufficient (and existing commercial platforms too expensive). In this
paper we describe a set of desirable characteristics for an open,
extensible visually-guided robot platform. We then present our solution,
the BuPiGo (pronounced buppy-go), describing the hardware itself and a

this methodology can be employed in the teaching of other type of
programming languages such as C, Java, or Dart. It has selected as

presents a striking opportunity for the advancement of scientific
instrumentation. Multirotors are particularly versatile platforms which
offer some clear advantages for marine-based research missions including
mapping and surveying of coastal, glacial, or marine features,
photogrammetry, remote atmospheric or water sample collection, specimen
tracking, and rare-event monitoring. The Olin College Intelligent
Vehicle Laboratory has been actively developing on multirotor platforms
to autonomously perform these missions, with special focus on
photogrammetric and breath condensate sample collection from cetaceans.
A critical part of our work is the design of an intelligent controller
which will allow the multirotor to land on the deck of a research vessel
or vessel of opportunity following the completion of a mission. A
central control computer that may be located on the vessel will call the
multirotor to return to the research vessel's deck, which has continued
to travel during the mission. A global positioning system (GPS) attached
to a specialized platform on the deck of the boat provides the current
position of the landing platform to the multirotor. Once the multirotor
arrives above the perceived location of the landing platform, a downward
facing camera mounted onto the vehicle is used to identify a fiducial
element that is located on the platform. Using the fiducial element and
known state of the vehicle, a visual surveying methodology is used to
allow the vehicle to land accurately on the specialized landing
platform.
Unlike in most simulated or controlled environments, the deck of a
vessel of opportunity can move unpredictably in 5 axes (roll, pitch,
yaw, longitudinal, latitudinal) due to oceanic characteristics and
weather conditions. At present, trained multirotor pilots are the
standard for controlling air vehicles, especially under these
conditions. The scalability, risk, and cost of using a highly skilled
human pilot limits the usefulness of these platforms in large-scale
research missions. We are aiming to minimize the cost and risk
associated with these platforms by making them accessible to untrained
pilots as well as allowing for use of multiple platforms at one time and
allowing for easy design of missions that the vehicle can conduct
semi-supervised.
Beyond obvious physical changes to the multirotor, including reinforcing
structures or waterproofing, the multirotor itself must behave
adaptively and sensitively to its environment. Our multirotors are
equipped with the open hardware/software PixHawk autopilot system, which
automatically rejects small environmental disturbances and provides
telemetry data, such as GPS position and state of the vehicle which we
use for our controller. A camera mounted to a stabilizing gimbal at the
nose of the multirotor captures HD images, and a wireless video link
transmits these images and the data from the autopilot to the
vessel-mounted computer for processing. Our landing platform is also
equipped with a GPS and streams information to the central computer.
Two types of error are calculated by the computer: macro-error and
micro-error. Macro-error refers to the gross positions of the landing
platform and the vehicle using GPS signals. Microerror refers to the
position of the vehicle in reference to the position of the landing
platform fiducial element. These are used to determine the appropriate
thrust and directional vectors to give to the vehicle to make a
successful landing.
In Spring of 2016, we implemented successful fiducial identification
using computer vision techniques which extract vehicle state and image
information to determine relative location of the vehicle to a known
fiducial. Using this, we have developed a preliminary controller which
allows for station-keeping of the vehicle above an identified fiducial
on the ground. In the Summer of 2016, we will continue to develop the
control scheme for fiducial identification, vehicle navigation, and
landing procedure through field tests at locations including Buzzards
Bay, Lake Waban, and the Gloucester Harbor.
Our technology depends upon, and is itself, open-source. This allows for
rapid iteration of controller design and means that what we develop can
be made widely available to the marineresearch community for immediate
use or customization. By putting these powerful tools in the hands of
marine researchers, the need for completing missions manually can be
eliminated. Landing on a vessel of opportunity is a significant step
towards fully autonomous aerial instrumentation for marine-based
research.}",,,,,{2016},,"{Protocol for Autonomous Landing of Unmanned Air Vehicles on Research

the absolute position of the IW (a mobile robot) is estimated using

Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the Internet of Things (IoT). Thanks to
decades of research in clock technologies and synchronization protocols,
it is now possible to measure and synchronize time across distributed
systems with unprecedented accuracy. However, applications have not
benefited to the same extent due to limitations of the system services
that help manage time, and hardware-OS and OS-application interfaces
through which timing information flows to the application. Due to the
importance of time awareness in a broad range of emerging applications,
running on commodity platforms and operating systems, it is imperative
to rethink how time is handled across the system stack. We advocate the
adoption of a holistic notion of Quality of Time (QoT) that captures
metrics such as resolution, accuracy, and stability. Building on this
notion we propose an architecture in which the local perception of time
is a controllable operating system primitive with observable
uncertainty, and where time synchronization balances applications'
timing demands with system resources such as energy and bandwidth. Our
architecture features an expressive application programming interface
that is centered around the abstraction of a timeline -a virtual
temporal coordinate frame that is defined by an application to provide
its components with a shared sense of time, with a desired accuracy and
resolution. The timeline abstraction enables developers to easily write
applications whose activities are choreographed across time and space.
Leveraging open source hardware and software components, we have
implemented an initial Linux realization of the proposed timeline-driven
QoT stack on a standard embedded computing platform. Results from its
evaluation are also presented.}",,{191-202},,,{2016},,{Timeline: An Operating System Abstraction for Time-Aware Applications},"Anwar, Fatima M. and D'souza, Sandeep and Symington, Andrew and Dongare,

partially addressed by the introduction of open source hardware but it

(DAQ) system has features that it uses the framed data protocol based on

type at different sample rates, and the system receives data through USB
communication or serial communication. The software of the proposed
system consists of the firmware of a microcontroller and user-defined
Simulink function block. The firmware of a microcontroller is in the
form of a header file, and the data acquisition can be easily achieved
by calling a few functions defined in the header file. The developed
user-defined Simulink block can get multiple data at different sample
rates by configuring the GUI parameters appropriately. For
implementation of the system, we use the Arch Max, which is the
open-source hardware with an ARM Cortex-M4 core, and also use a
user-defined c-code S-function of Matlab/Simulink. For the demonstration
of the superiority of the implemented system, we compare the proposed
system's performance with that of the data acquisition system provided

amplitude and its detection allows the estimation of the heart rate.
This paper is devoted to present the design of a digital filter
implemented on an open hardware platform called Arduino to detect the R
wave of the ECG signal. The filter design is based on the integration of
a smooth filter and the first order derivative. The implemented digital

static - gesture recognition system. The implemented system has three
major components: A Glove and Sensor Unit (GSU) - consisting of a pair
of gloves embedded with custom made, low-cost flex and contact sensors,
a Primary Supporting Hardware (PSH) that maps change in input values
from GSU, a Secondary Supporting Hardware (SSH) that processes the input
values and recognizes the gesture accurately. When a gesture is signed,
the GSU tracks the change in orientation of the fingers, which results
in a change in voltage levels of the sensors. This change is mapped by
the PSH and passed on to SSH which comprises of two ATmega328P
microcontrollers, one connected to each of the glove. The two
microcontrollers are connected in a master-slave configuration and
communication between them is facilitated through an XBee module. The
performance of this gesture recognition system is evaluated using a data
set comprising of 36 unique gestures. These gestures represent a total
of 120 gestures that include all gestures across five globally used sign
languages. A gesture recognition engine that resides in the master
microcontroller processes the input and identifies the gesture. The
gesture recognition engine comprises of a two stage
selection-elimination embedded intelligence algorithm that is used to
enhance the system efficiency from 83.1\% to 94.5\% without any

center for ensuring continuity of company's Information Technology
operations in case the main data center encounters a serious downtime
especially for companies engaged to work in distributed manner to
increase quality-of-service to their customers. Environmental downtime
is a significant cost to organizations and makes them unable to do
business because what happens in the data center affects everyone. In
addition, the amount of electrical energy consumed by data center
increases with the amount of computing power installed. One strategy of
reducing energy consumption in data centers is to adjust the temperature
and humidity data. Installation of physical Information Technology and
facilities related to environment on monitoring temperature, humidity,
power, flood, smoke, air flow, room entry is the most proactive way to
reduce the unnecessary costs of expensive hardware replacement or
unplanned downtime and decrease energy consumed by servers. In this
paper, we present remote system for monitoring auxiliary data centers
implemented using open-source hardware platforms, Arduino, Raspberry Pi,
and the Gobetwino. The objective of collecting temperature and humidity
data allows monitoring server's health and gets alerts if things start
to go wrong. When the temperature hits 50 degrees C., the supervisor at
remote headquarters would get a SMS, then take appropriate actions that
make sense to reduce electrical costs and preserve functionality of

between humans and machines. BCI based on non-invasive neuroimaging
techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG) have many applications,
however the dissemination of the technology is limited, in part because
of the price of the hardware. In this paper we compare side by side two
EEG amplifiers, the consumer grade OpenBCI and the medical grade g. tec
g. USBamp. For this purpose, we employed an original montage, based on
the simultaneous recording of the same set of electrodes. Two set of
recordings were performed. During the first experiment a simple adapter
with a direct connection between the amplifiers and the electrodes was
used. Then, in a second experiment, we attempted to discard any possible
interference that one amplifier could cause to the other by adding
``ideal{''} diodes to the adapter. Both spectral and temporal features
were tested - the former with a workload monitoring task, the latter
with an visual P300 speller task. Overall, the results suggest that the
OpenBCI board - or a similar solution based on the Texas Instrument
ADS1299 chip - could be an effective alternative to traditional EEG
devices. Even though a medical grade equipment still outperforms the
OpenBCI, the latter gives very close EEG readings, resulting in practice
in a classification accuracy that may be suitable for popularizing BCI
uses.}",,{105-114},,,{2016},,"{Comparison of an Open-hardware Electroencephalography Amplifier with

operating in such dynamic environments like the RoboCup Middle-Size
League (MSL). In the RoboCup MSL, two teams of five autonomous robots
play on an 18- x 12-m field. Equipped with sensors and on-board
computers, each robot should be able to perceive the environment, make
decision and control itself to play the soccer game autonomously.
Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents the design of our
soccer robots, participating in RoboCup MSL. The mechanical platform,
electrical architecture and software framework are discussed separately.
The mechanical platform is designed modularly, so easy maintainability
is achieved; the electronic architecture is built on industrial
standards using PC-based control technique, which results in high
robustness and reliability during the intensive and fierce MSL games;
the software is developed upon the open-source Robot Operating System
(ROS); thus, the advantages of ROS such as modularity, portability and
expansibility are inherited.
Findings - Based on this paper and the open-source hardware and
software, the MSL robots can be re-developed easily to participate in
the RoboCup MSL. The robots can also be used in other research and
education fields, especially for multi-robot systems and distributed
artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the main designing ideas proposed
in the paper, i.e. using a modular mechanical structure, an industrial
electronic system and ROS-based software, provide a common solution for
designing general intelligent robots.
Originality/value - The methodology of the intelligent robot design for
highly competitive and dynamic RoboCup MSL environments is proposed.}",,{91-102},{1},{43},{2016},"{INDUSTRIAL ROBOT-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS RESEARCH AND

openness in 3D printing, with a case study of how MakerBot Industries
leveraged external communities and selective openness become the
consumer market leader. After reviewing the literature on systemic
innovation and selective openness, we document the proprietary
strategies of a dozen startup companies during the first two decades of
the 3D printing industry. We contrast this to the open hardware,
software and content strategy that MakerBot's founders used to enter and
grow the consumer market from 2009 onward. We show how MakerBot shifted
to a selectively open, systemic innovation strategy that complemented
proprietary hardware and software with open user-generated content from
its Thingiverse online community. From this, we suggest the inherent
complementarity of selective openness strategies between open and
proprietary components, and conclude with predictions as to when and how
a startup or incumbent firm will combine open and proprietary elements.

to sectioning and microstructural analysis, hardness traverses were

information to monitor crops or make yield predictions is a challenge.
An approach is to use crop yield models in combination with real-time
data used as input in such models. It was demonstrated that it is
possible to design an accurate system using open source hardware and
open systems to record the input for these models and monitor crops. The
system presented has two main components: a device that records
environmental parameters and a smartphone application (software) that
links this device to a data server in order to process and analyse the
information. The solution is scalable in terms of the type of sensors
used (i.e. temperature and relative humidity of the air or soil), the
rate of information retrieval and so on, so it can be used in various
scenarios, including environmental or land policy monitoring. Moreover,
this open source hardware can be used by a broad variety of users and is
an alternative in poor rural areas because of its low cost compared to
other solutions. It can enable increased agricultural production and
management of the local environment, bringing new agricultural practices
to these areas. Furthermore, progress in the use of this type of
technology can help to develop new capabilities for growers. Results of
calibration tests and measurements to demonstrate the usefulness of this
system in precision agriculture are presented. (C) 2015 IAgrE. Published

leading to strict regulations regarding the impact of products and

consumption monitoring in manufacturing companies can lead to a
reduction of machine tools energy wastes and consequently to lower
expenses. To this end, a complete transparency of energy usage among the
entire manufacturing facilities is required. Despite the small volume of
material processed, micro manufacturing processes are energy intensive
and the optimization of energy usage becomes critical for manufacturing
sustainability. Electrical discharge machining (EDM) is considered an
attractive solution for the manufacturing of microcomponents. In this
paper, a low cost and modular data acquisition system, based on
open-hardware and open-source software, for online energy consumption
monitoring, is presented. The system described is applied for energy
efficiency analysis of the micro EDM milling process by using a state of
the art commercial machine tool. A number of sensors is connected to the
data acquisition system to measure the energy consumption of the main
sub-systems of the machine tool, data is recorded through a
microcontroller, and sent to the main computer via Wi-Fi for data
storage and analysis. Results show that the process efficiency depends
on machine parameters but it is always far below 0.01 \%. Solutions are
suggested to improve the energy efficiency of the machine tool

Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education and
Career and Technical Education (CTE), as well as integrating these two
educational emphases and providing opportunities for cross-curriculum
engagement. The objective of this study is to investigate the potential
of open-source (OS) technologies in an educational setting, given the
combination of economic constraints affecting all educational
environments and the ability of OS design to profoundly decrease the
cost of technological tools and technological innovation.
Methods: This paper reports on a 3-day workshop augmented with online
instructional and visual tools designed for middle school and high
school level educators from a wide array of disciplines (including
traditional science, math, and engineering as well as computer, shop,
and art). Teachers (n=22) submitted applications to participate in the
workshop, the workshop was observed for both evaluation and research,
teachers participated in focus groups (n=2) during the workshop in order
to discuss their interest in OS 3-D printing technology and its
potential role in their classrooms, and teachers completed a voluntary
post-workshop survey and responded to follow-up after printers were in
the classroom for one year.
Results: During the workshop teachers built 3-D printers using OS
technologies that they were then able to take back to their schools and
into their classrooms.
Conclusion: Through workshops augmented with online instructional and
visual tools designed to provide facilitated yet self-directed
engagement with a new, relatively unknown, and relatively complex
technology, paired teacher teams were able to successfully build and use
RepRap 3-D printers based on OS design in just three days. Practice:
Here, we discuss both what the teachers learned and what we learned from
the teachers regarding the potential for educators to construct OS 3-D
printing technologies as a tool of empowering and transformative
education.
Implications: Open-source 3-D printing technologies have the potential
to improve education through a sense of empowerment resulting from
active participation, as well as through cross-curriculum engagement.

Closed-loop DBS with real-time feedback is gaining attention in recent
years, after proved more effective than conventional DBS in terms of
pathological symptom control clinically. Here we demonstrate the
conceptualization and validation of a closed-loop DBS system using
open-source hardware. We used hippocampal theta oscillations as system
input, and electrical stimulation in the mesencephalic reticular
formation (mRt) as controller output. It is well documented that
hippocampal theta oscillations are highly related to locomotion, while
electrical stimulation in the mRt induces freezing. We used an Arduino
open-source microcontroller between input and output sources. This
allowed us to use hippocampal local field potentials (LFPs) to steer
electrical stimulation in the mRt. Our results showed that closed-loop
DBS significantly suppressed locomotion compared to no stimulation, and
required on average only 56\% of the stimulation used in open-loop DBS
to reach similar effects. The main advantages of open-source hardware
include wide selection and availability, high customizability, and
affordability. Our open-source closed-loop DBS system is effective, and
warrants further research using open-source hardware for closed-loop
neuromodulation.}",{APR 21},,,{4},{2015},{Scientific Reports},"{Conceptualization and validation of an open-source closed-loop deep

However, they also introduce new challenges in balancing the need for

technologies, health technology design standards and regulations evolve
slowly, and therefore, it can be difficult to apply these standards to

popular way to create medical devices in the maker community. Medical
device standards may not be flexible enough when evaluating the
usability of mobile medical devices that can be used in a multitude of
different ways, outside of clinical settings. Similarly, while
regulatory guidance has been updated to address the proliferation of
health-related mobile phone apps, it can be hard to know if and when

combined with the decrease in hardware component prices and the increase
in the popularity of open hardware, has favored the deployment of sensor
networks based on open hardware. The new trends in Internet Protocol

Internet, turning them into smart objects (Internet of Things and Web of

lack of communication protocol standardization, which turns into

sensor nodes were built using open hardware solutions, and

increasing number of open embedded platforms available and also a wide

we provide a comparison of existing built-for-purpose devices against

processing is done offline to allow for optimization of parameter
estimation. The pupil and corneal reflection are estimated using a novel

which the corneal reflection sits at the edge of the pupil and therefore
breaks the contour of the ellipse. The accuracy and precision of the

approach and tinkering pedagogy towards developing the students skills
in STEM domains (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) with
aim to the designing the laboratory for radiation detector development.
Involving from one side concept of social situatedness and
connectedness, and from another the concept of independent,
self-directed and self-regulated student learning, the project was based
on assembling the mini-lab, Radiation Sensor Board for Arduino, that was
originally designed to help people in Japan to measure levels of
radiation in their everyday life after the Fukushima accident. As it was
reported elsewhere, this product was an example of crowdsourcing. When
Libelien designed the Radiation Sensor Board for Waspmote, the idea was
simple: with the Arduino platform people will be able to have easily
running their own detector at home while on the other hand with Waspmote
platform authorities will be able to deploy autonomous sensor networks
to send the radiation levels from dangerous areas using wireless sensor
platform ZigBee and GPRS technologies. This paper present students
developing project where the Sensor Board for Arduino was used as
assembling, teaching tool. The Do-It-Yourself and Internet of Things can
be used both in educational, and in the research and development
purposes. Owning their own mini-lab at their disposal anytime, students
worked at their learning speed. It also boosted the interest, confidence
of students and highly affected three domains of learning: cognitive
domain (activities like instrumentation, modeling, experimentation, data
analysis and design, psychomotor domain (activities like manipulating
the apparatus, sensory awareness) and affective domain (behavior and
attitudes to learn from failure, creativity, collaborative
communication, safety and ethics in the laboratory). We show that
networking learning, supported by hands-on labs on chip, and an open
source electronics prototyping platform as Arduino and Raspberry Pi,
give great opportunities for teaching and learning the tinkering and
inventing skills, an request we have to deal with it at the University
of Montenegro. Such project support exploratory and serendipitous
learning. It moved teching from an emphasis simply on linear logic and
programmed instruction, towards non-linear, networked, branching,
hypertext views of learning, in which connections between knowledge are
made and developed. It is based on principle of situated cognition and
Vigotskian thought: situatedness, commonality, interdependency and
infrastructure where learning is fascinated by an activity. The
presented project integrate a Virtual Learning Environment, networking
knowledge and student-owned movable laboratory on the chip, where
radiation was used as a topic and where electronics was embedded and
embodied.}",,{165-173},,,{2015},,"{ADVANCED TEACHING WITH THE EMBEDDED MINI LAB: PROPOSAL FOR DEVELOPING A

rocket from the Wallops Flight Facility. This payload will contain
several novel technologies that work together to demonstrate
methodologies for space sample return missions and for nanosatellite
communications in general. The payload will deploy and test an
Exo-Brake, which slows the payload aerodynamically, providing eventual
de-orbit and recovery of future ISS samples through a Small Payload
Quick Return project. In addition, this flight addresses future Mars
mission entry technology, space-to-space communications using the
Iridium Short Messaging Service (SMS), GPS tracking, and wireless
sensors using the ZigBee protocol. SOAREX-8 is being assembled and
tested at Ames Research Center (ARC) and the NASA Engineering and Safety
Center (NESC) is funding sensor and communications work. Open source
Arduino technology and software are used for system control. The ZigBee
modules used are XBee units that connect analog sensors for temperature,
air pressure and acceleration measurement wirelessly to the payload
telemetry system. Our team is developing methods for power distribution
and module mounting, along with software for sensor integration, data
assembly and downlink. We have demonstrated relaying telemetry to the
ground using the Iridium satellite constellation on a previous flight,
but the upcoming flight will be the first time we integrate useful
flight test data from a ZigBee wireless sensor network. Wireless sensor
data will measure the aerodynamic efficacy of the Exo-Brake permitting
further on-orbit flight tests of improved designs. The Exo-Brake is 5
m(2) in area and will be stored in a container and deployed during
ascent once the payload is jettisoned from the launch vehicle. We intend
to further refine the hardware and continue testing on balloon launches,
future sounding rocket flights and on nanosatellite missions. The use of
standards-based and open-source hardware/software has allowed for this
project to be completed with a very modest budget and a challenging
schedule. There is a wealth of hardware and software available for both
the Arduino platform and the XBee, all low-cost or open-source. Along
with the Exo-Brake hardware and deployment discussion, this paper will
describe in detail the system architecture emphasizing the successful
use of open-source hardware and software to minimize effort and cost.
Testing procedures, radio frequency interference (RFI) mitigation,
success criteria and expected results will also be discussed. The use of
Iridium short messaging capability for space-to-space links,
standards-based wireless sensor networks, and other innovative

career paths. While many ``National Engineers Week{''} programs exist
for primary and middle school students, there is a lack of hands on
activities for students in the 9th-12th grades. It is often difficult to
devise experiments for this age group that are interesting and not
juvenile. Yet, it is during these crucial years that most students are
lost to science, math and engineering. Engaging students and presenting
opportunities for invention and excitement is important in the teen
years, when peer pressure and the distractions of friends, social
events, and activities are particularly high.(1). There are a number of
open source programming and affordable hardware platforms that can be
used to implement low cost and interactive programs to promote
innovation with various age groups. In this paper we share our work, as
well as our learnings on how to make the workshops more effective. We
have created various Arduino projects that can be customized to grade
levels ranging from grades 7-12, and even college undergraduate
students. The various projects we describe in this paper have been used
to interact with students of different grade levels to engage in basic
elements of engineering and computer programming. The classes should be
set up to work in groups to promote shared innovation, teamwork and
collaboration with peers. The open source and hardware experimenting
exposed the students to various career paths ranging from software
engineer, to electronic engineers and basic elements of various other
engineering paths. This paper is designed to demonstrate the promotion
of the engineering profession in schools through the use of Arduino Uno,
Raspberry Pi Gemma kits, and Flora kits. The programs are also designed
to accommodate classroom setting, workshops, or as an in-class field

designed to navigate also in shallow water owing to a low draft design.
An embedded system with Robot Operating System (ROS) onboard has been
deployed on the surface vehicle. One of the main advantages of the
proposed solution is its reduced cost owing to open-hardware/software
solutions. In particular, an open-hardware solution is responsible for
the interfacing of an RTK GPS with a bathymetric ultrasound sensor to
map the sea/lake / river floor. The boat can be either remotely
controllable or fully autonomous. An Augmented Reality (AR) application
has been also developed to show the path and the set of survey blocks
that are mapped/not mapped. The AR application is particularly useful
when the user remotely controls the boat, but also for supervising the
autonomous survey. The performances achieved in the first trials are

increasing role in industrial and medical applications. This is due to
the ability to deposit a small amount of material in precisely defined
position. In the field of Biofabrication, inkjet printers are used to
build 2D and 3D scaffolds and gels with biological molecules, including
living cells. Several works, including seminal papers on inkjet
bioprinting, were carried out with modified office printers. These
printers have fixed structural characteristics and operating size,
especially on the print-head, limiting the range of materials that can
be dispensed. The aim of the present work is the design and fabrication
of an open-source piezoelectric inkjet print-head, optimized for the
bioprinting field. This low-cost, reproducible, reliable, versatile and
biocompatible device will enable various research laboratories to work
with a shared device; the open source allowing for parts to be modified
to suit specific needs. The design was carried out by Finite Element
(FE) modelling of the piezoelectric, mechanical, fluid dynamics and
their coupling. The design was optimized for shear rate, which we
minimized in order to be able to print cells. The mechanical frame of
the printer was designed and built using a low-cost 3D printer. The
nozzle plate was fabricated from a polycarbonate disc coated with
biocompatible silicone, to increase the hydrophobicity of the outer
surface of the disc, preventing ink adhesion on the edge of the nozzle;
the refilling system, and the electronic control were also part of the
project and will be freely available to download. The FE models were
validated with ad-hoc experiments, printing water, gelatin solution, and
cell culture media, by modulating the wave power in amplitude, frequency
and duty cycle. The tests showed a large working window both respect to
viscosity and to surface tension. Finally Human Skin Fibroblasts
(ATCC-CRL-2522, Teddington UK), suspended in culture media, were
printed. Cell viability, assessed by CellTiter-Blue and LIVE / DEAD
tests, resulted comparable with the control, demonstrating the validity
of the first open source piezoelectric inkjet print-head for
biofabrication. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an open

outsourced in dyadic relationships. Instead, we are in a new age where
technologies are developed by a networked community of actors and
organizations, which base their relations dynamically to each other on a
common interest. Such dynamic and networked complexity of technology
development is often theoretical explored around the concept of
platform, and more recently by employing the concept of ecosystem in an
analogy to natural ecosystems. Following the success of open-source
software, academics have long been examining openness in digital
platforms/ecosystems; however most contributions take the perspective of
a single stakeholder from the many that constitute a digital
platform/ecosystem. Predominantly, they take the sole perspective of
platform providers, those bundling hardware and software or more rarely,
the perspective of third-party software developers developing valuable
software `apps' that add value to the overall platform. In this
conceptual article, we grasp openness more holistically, both by
acknowledging that openness means different things to different people
and involve all stakeholders within the platforms/ecosystems. Towards
the development of a theory of openness within digital settings, we
propose six novel aspects of openness for enabling a greater
understanding of the open-source software movement with a digital
platforms/ecosystems perspective. Moreover, we invite scholars to
reconsider the more predominating product-dominant logic in open-source

clock rates reached the limit. Instead of a single-core processor,
multi-core and many-core processors have been mainstream to accelerate
applications by parallel processing. Year by year, the number of cores
integrated in a single chip has been increased due to improvements of
semiconductor integration technologies depending on Moore's Law. On the
other hand, Moore's Law will be ended in the near future. This means
that the approaches relying on the increase in the number of cores will
be hopeless, thus we have to consider other effective ways. One of them
is to design application specific hardware. Several research
organizations have explored it and reported its remarkable findings. We
focus on such an acceleration approach with dedicated hardware.
As a case study with dedicated hardware, we present a sorting
acceleration method. Sorting is an extremely important computation
kernel that should be accelerated in a lot of fields, such as databases,
image processing, data compression, etc. We propose a sorting
accelerator combining Sorting Network and Merge Sorter Tree, and detail

customizable, thus designers can implement a sorting accelerator
composed of required hardware resources by means of tuning design
parameters. Our experiments show that the proposed hardware achieves up

OpenMote is a open-hardware prototyping ecosystem designed to accelerate
the development of the Industrial Internet of Things ( IIoT). It
features the OpenMote-CC2538, a state-of-the-art computing and
communication device. This device interfaces with several other
accessories, or ``skins{''}, through a standardized connector. The skins
developed to date include boards to provide power, boards which enable a
developer to easily debug the platform, and boards to allow seamless
integration of an OpenMote network into the Internet.
This hardware ecosystem is complemented by a suite of software tools and
ports to popular open-source IoT implementations. The OpenMote platform
is for example tailored to run the OpenWSN open-source implementation of
emerging IIoT standards. The combination of hardware and software
ecosystems gives an embedded programmer an intuitive and complete

Apps that fit his/her needs, thereby creating an individual smartphone.
The Apps, however, are software modules. The modules that are considered

expanding rapidly, and their design can be the difference between an
immensely profitable system or a damaged system. Designing a robust
control system requires to test the control algorithms in the actual
controller hardware. However, WT are large and expensive, thus we would
like to perform this test virtually, without using prototypes of the WT.
This work develops a fault diagnosis (FD) and fault tolerant control
(FTC) of pitch actuators in wind turbines. This is accomplished by
combining a disturbance compensator with a controller, both of which are
formulated in the discrete-time domain. The disturbance compensator has
a dual purpose: to reconstruct the actuator fault (which is used by the
FD technique) and to design the discrete-time controller to obtain a
FTC. That is, the actuator faults are reconstructed and then the control
inputs are modified to achieve a FTC with a comparable behavior to the
fault-free case. The performance of the FD and FTC schemes is tested in
a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) testbed for WT controllers. The used
controller hardware is an open hardware Arduino board which is connected
to the virtual WT via USB. The onshore 5MW turbine is simulated on the
open-source National Renewable Energy Laboratory WT simulator FAST
(Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structures, and Turbulence). The proposed HiL is
used to characterize the behavior of the WT in the full load region in

depth to the traditional two dimensions. This realistic vision gives the
surgeon the feeling of operating in real space. Hospital of
Treviglio-Caravaggio isn't an university or scientific institution; in
2014 a new 3D laparoscopic technology was acquired therefore it led to
evaluation of the of the appropriateness in term of patient outcome and
safety. The project aims at achieving the development of a quantitative
validation model that would ensure low cost and a reliable measure of
the performance of 3D technology versus 2D mode. In addition, it aims at
demonstrating how new technologies, such as open source hardware and
software and 3D printing, could help research with no significant cost
increase. For these reasons, in order to define criteria of
appropriateness in the use of 3D technologies, it was decided to perform
a study to technically validate the use of the best technology in terms
of effectiveness, efficiency and safety in the use of a system between
laparoscopic vision in 3D and the traditional 2D.
METHODS: 30 surgeons were enrolled in order to perform an exercise
through the use of laparoscopic forceps inside a trainer. The exercise
consisted of having surgeons with different level of seniority, grouped
by type of specialization (eg. surgery, urology, gynecology), exercising
videolaparoscopy with two technologies (2D and 3D) through the use of a
anthropometric phantom. The target assigned to the surgeon was that to
pass ``needle and thread{''} without touching the metal part in the
shortest time possible. The rings selected for the exercise had each a
coefficient of difficulty determined by depth, diameter, angle from the
positioning and from the point of view.

Operators (MNOs) keep a high percentage of their deployed infrastructure
using Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) technologies. With
about 3.5 billion subscribers, GSM remains as the de facto standard for
cellular communications. However, the security criteria envisioned 30
years ago, when the standard was designed, are no longer sufficient to
ensure the security and privacy of the users. Furthermore, even with the
newest fourth generation (4G) cellular technologies starting to be
deployed, these networks could never achieve strong security guarantees
because the MNOs keep backwards-compatibility given the huge amount of
GSM subscribers. In this paper, we present and describe the tools and
necessary steps to perform an active attack against a GSM-compatible
network, by exploiting the GSM protocol lack of mutual authentication
between the subscribers and the network. The attack consists of a
so-called man-in-the-middle attack implementation. By using Software
Defined Radio (SDR), open-source libraries and open-source hardware, we
setup a fake GSM base station to impersonate the network and therefore
eavesdrop any communications that are being routed through it and
extract information from their victims. Finally, we point out some
implications of the protocol vulnerabilities and how these can not be
mitigated in the short term since 4G deployments will take long time to
entirely replace the current GSM infrastructure.}",,,,,{2015},,{SDR-based network impersonation attack in GSM-compatible networks},"Aragon, Santiago and Kuhlmann, Federico and Villa, Tania",inproceedings,ISI:000371404700485,,,,,,,{IEEE; Freescale Semicond Inc; IEEE Vehicular Technol Soc},"{81st IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring), Univ

reliable platform with a dual-core processor (implemented using a FPGA)
architecture designed as open-hardware, running two isolated real-time
operating systems which are connected through a safe core-to-core

Moreover, the safety-critical system is connected to an external
processor, an ARM9, which is used as an external sensing system. The
ARM9 runs the non-safety-critical applications and allows the system to

typically constrained devices and this creates dependencies between the

integrate a battery-operated 6LoWPAN-enabled smart water meter to an

First, we summarize the range of current practices in wireless sensor
network research projects by analyzing recent contributions in the
literature. Specifically, for each wireless sensor network project, we
compile details regarding the scope (e.g., simulation, testbed, real
deployment), the type of mote used (e.g., TinyOS, Android, Arduino), and
the type of sensors used (e.g., inertial, biological).
Next, we discuss reasons why Arduino based wireless devices are perhaps
the future of applied wireless sensor network research. Arduino-based
systems are inexpensive, easy to use, readily available, well
documented, 100\% open-source (hardware and software), object oriented,
extendable (using the ``shield{''} concept), and flexible (e.g., in
terms of radio choices). Lastly, we discuss the pros and cons of

two simple devices to perform injection (1.6 +/- 0.4 mu L/stroke) and
mixing of different solutions. Furthermore, a practical demonstration of
the utility of this system for microscale chemical sample handling and

systems with off-the-shelf basic modules (e.g., sensors, actuators, and
controllers), integrating hardware and software, which can be assembled
in a plug-and-play way. R2P provides hardware modules, a protocol for
real-time communication, a middleware to connect components as well as
tools to support the development of software on the modules. R2P aims at
dramatically reduce time and efforts required to build a prototype
robot, making it possible to focus the resources on the development of
new robotic applications instead of struggling on their implementation.
This enables also people with experience in a specific application
domain, but with little technical background, to actively participate in
the development of new robotic applications. R2P is open-source both in
its software and hardware to promote its diffusion among the robotics
community and novel business models that will substantially reduce the
costs to design a new robotic product. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

measuring participants' responses to these events. Often computer
screens, speakers and keyboards are sufficient. However, these devices
are not appropriate for some situations. For example, some studies
present tactile or olfactory stimuli or brain stimulation. Likewise,
keyboard buttons are not appropriate for use with vocal responses, small
animals or individuals with motor impairments.
New method: We describe StimSync, which simulates USB keyboard inputs,
allowing use with most experimental software. StimSync can measure
button presses, optical signals from magnetic resonance imaging systems,
changes in ambient light (e.g. synchronizing intracranial
electrography), and auditory events (a voice key). In addition to the
USB keyboard mode (necessarily millisecond precision), StimSync can also
be set to provide higher precision timing. This feature can be used to
validate timing, ensuring event synchronization (e.g. auditory events,
visual events, brain stimulation). In addition to recording inputs,
StimSync provides seven digital outputs for controlling external
devices. Finally, StimSync can record analog inputs; we illustrate how
this can be used to evaluate the rise time for computer displays.
Results: We observed outputs with a mean latency of 2.1 ms (sd = 0.17
ms) and USB inputs with a mean latency of 2 ms (sd = 0.54 ms).
Comparison with existing method(s): StimSync statistically outperforms
two professional solutions and numerically outperforms other devices
described in the literature.
Conclusions: StimSync
(http://www.mccauslandcenter.sc.edu/CRNL/tools/stimsync) provides an
open-source solution for controlling and validating neuroscience
experiments. In addition to sharing the design, we have produced a batch
of devices to demonstrate the market for professional implementations.

on the pre-silicon design phase of hardware. Before the tape-out, a
pre-silicon design has to be thoroughly inspected by time-consuming
functional verification and code review to exclude bugs. For functional
verification and code review, a critical issue determining their
efficiency is the allocation of resources (e.g., computational resources
and manpower) to different modules of a design, which is conventionally
guided by designers' experiences. Such practices, though simple and
straightforward, may take high risks of wasting resources on bug-free
modules or missing bugs in buggy modules, and thus could affect the
success and timeline of the tape-out. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework called pre-silicon bug forecast to predict the bug information
of hardware designs. In this framework, bug models are built via machine
learning techniques to characterize the relationship between design
characteristics and the bug information, which can be leveraged to
predict how bugs distribute in different modules of the current design.
Such predicted bug information is adequate to regulate the resources
among different modules to achieve efficient functional verification and
code review. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed pre-silicon
bug forecast framework, we conducted detailed experiments on several
open-source hardware projects. Moreover, we also investigate the impacts
of different learning techniques and different sets of characteristic on
the performance of bug models. Experimental results show that with
appropriate learning techniques and characteristics, about 90\% modules
could be correctly predicted as buggy or clean and the number of bugs of
each module could also be accurately predicted.}",{MAR},{451-463},{3},{33},{2014},"{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND

frequency signatures in the current's spectrum has become an established
standard in the field of industrial maintenance systems. Nevertheles,
its implementation on devices with low computing power remains a
practical challenge. Industrial controllers, such as programmable logic
controllers, or modern, low cost controller hardware, such as the
Arduino or the Raspberry Pi open source hardware proposals, lack both
the on-board memory and the high speed data acquisition hardware to
perform an accurate spectral analysis of the machine's current, in order
to identify the spectral components produced by each type of fault. In
this paper, a signal conditioning unit, based on a novel downsampling
method of the current, is presented. This unit reduces the amount of
current samples that must be processed by the diagnostic unit to a mere
sample per current cycle, maintains the sub-hertz accuracy needed to
resolve fault, and converts the mains component into a constant value
that can be easily eliminated without using any additional filter.
Besides, it is implemented using low cost devices, just resistors and
operational amplifiers. The proposed method is theoretically developed
in this paper, and it has been validated using induction motors with
broken bars fed directly by the mains or through variable speed drives.}",,{1516-1522},,,{2014},,"{Condition monitoring of electrical machines using low computing power

without some sort of equally colorful visual aids. While static displays

trend, aided by the recent permeation of small interactive devices into

familiar to some, but the open source hardware movement is relatively
new. These are electronic circuit board designs that are provided for
free and can be implemented in physical hardware by anyone. This
movement has led to the availability of some relatively inexpensive, but
quite capable, computing power for the creation of small devices.

over the centuries. For this reason, the historical and critical
interpretation requires a key capable of simplifying the understanding
of all the modifications.
Starting from both an archival study and an architectural survey, we
created different 3D models to help analyze and understand all the
historical and architectural phases of the complex. The 3D-model
reconstructions are based on metric and land surveys. The survey
permitted us to identify seven main historical phases. In this way
knowledge of the abbey becomes an elaborate history that needs an
appropriate dissemination tool. The abbey is now abandoned due to its
poor state and no action has been taken for its improvement or
preservation. A first step in raising awareness of this forgotten
cultural object is to foster better knowledge of its history through a
new visual interface that is able to clarify all the events that have
occurred over time. In order to explain the complex history of the
abbey, we tested a new approach based on the use of a mock-up as a
physical interface allowing access to different digital content. For
this purpose we used open-source hardware: an Arduino-based
microcontroller, named Makey Makey, connected to different parts of the
mock-up through wired buttons. In this way, the computer processes the

charge of monitoring the various sensors and, with the help of
Nagiosgraph, to keep track of the historic data and to produce the

directly touches the lives of millions of people; not just patients but

serving humanity. Growth of Mobil Devices and Cloud Computing has
changed the way we live and work. We try to bring the benefits of these
technological innovations to the medical field via equipment which can
improve the working efficiencies and capabilities of the medical
professionals and technicians. The improvements in the camera and image
processing capabilities of the Mobile Devices coupled with their
improved processing power and an infinite processing and storage offered
by Cloud Computing infrastructure opens up a window of opportunity to
use them in the specialized field like microsurgery. To enable
microsurgery, surgeons use optical microscope to zoom into the working
area to get better visibility and control. However, these devices suffer
from various drawbacks and are not comfortable to use. We build a Tablet
with large stereoscopic screen allowing glasses free 3D display enabled
by cameras capable of capturing 3D video and enhanced by an image
processing pipeline, greatly improves the visibility and viewing comfort
of the surgeon. Moreover using the capabilities of Cloud computing,
these surgeries can be recorded and streamed live for education,
training and consultation. An expert sitting in a geographically remote
location can guide the surgeon performing the surgery. All vital
parameters of the patient undergoing surgery can be shown as an overlay
on the Tablet screen so that the surgeon is alerted of any parameter
going beyond limit. Developing this kind of complex device involves
engineering skills in hardware and software and huge amount of

educators to deliver content and skills while engaging students in
hands-on projects that may potentially make use of a variety of
platforms. From proprietary to open source hardware and software, from
microcontrollers to embedded operating systems (OS) devices, students
today are challenged to accelerate their learning pace by working on
real-world projects in a supervised environment. Currently, students
rely on self-guidance in order to develop the knowledge base necessary
for achieving the goals of their team projects with respect to embedded
systems. This paper presents the results of an embedded systems
programming tutorial piloted with a group of 15 undergraduate students
from across the engineering disciplines and with a mix of sophomores
through seniors. The tutorial included a series of three lecture modules
prepared to introduce concepts on embedded systems. The modules were
tightly coupled with hands-on exercises that employed the DE2i-150
development board, aimed to introduce students to the development of
digital systems based on an Altera field programmable gate array (FPGA)
in conjunction with an Linux-based embedded OS running on an Intel Atom
processor. The first module provides an overview of the various inputs,
outputs, sensors, and displays of the board. The second module
introduces the embedded OS and guides students in establishing a
high-speed Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) link between
the Atom processor and the FPGA. The third module focuses on
implementing a custom C/++ application written by students for real-time
processing of inputs from four push buttons. Results show that the three
lecture modules of 30 minutes each, coupled with the hands-on projects,
offer a good introduction to the complexity of the DE2i-150 board.
Surveys collected before the first module and after the third show a
generally positive outcome. Recommendations for future efforts focus on
incorporating more complex C/++ applications concurrent with FPGA
development.}",,,,,{2014},,"{Evaluation of an Introductory Embedded Systems Programming Tutorial

is an important and irreplaceable component. Historically, good
platforms for a controls laboratory have been expensive, because the
equipment has typically been very specialized for educational purposes.
Moreover, the equipment often is not physically robust in the face of
student manhandling, creating major difficulties and costs in
maintaining such a lab. The advent of inexpensive open-source controller
hardware is revolutionizing this situation because it is now possible to
have good controls-hardware capability at relatively low cost. The
Arduino Mega 2560, in particular, is supported by Matlab, Simulink and
LabView, and thus provides a great deal of flexibility in developing
laboratory procedures for students to study controls.
The Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on
flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. The ``motor shield{''} is
an add-on (daughterboard) to the Arduino that further enables control of
dc motors. This paper explains a method and hardware to connect an

to navigate through the environment avoiding obstacles and performing a
map of its surrounding. This system performs these tasks using open

cheap sensors, motors and wheels, has been programmed using C++ language
on Arduino and ROS. The system communicates in real time with a PC where
the map is drawn using OpenCV libraries.
Regarding to the hardware, the robot has the structure of a PopBot-168
Arduino kit, which consists of a circular structure and two motors
connected to their corresponding wheels. The robot also has two encoders
and a magnetometer to perform location task. The processor is an Arduino
Mega board. The system features two infrared sensors that get the
distances of robot's environment in every directions due to a servomotor
that moves them.
The developed robot is able to perform a map of its environment and draw
it in a computer. The communication between the robot and the computer
is performed using ROS. This project has managed to introduce a ROS node
on the Arduino board. In the computer there are another two nodes, one
for draw the map and another which decide where to move.
Finally, as experimental results, an example of how the robot works
building a 2-dimensional reconstruction from an environment is shown.
Students can learn about the problem of auto-location and other
difficulties due to robotics itself. It is also a very good mechanism to

it is a cross platform, open source, and open hardware. Also, due to the
fact it's low-cost, flexibility, and simplicity. The sessions covered
topics of how to build a circuit, program an Arduino, demonstrate the

the advancement of society. Having access to education and the means of
production appears as the major factors for the implementation of this
goal. 3D printing is a revolutionary technology that has the potential
to bring digital manufacturing to everyone. However, the rise of
personal fabrication requires an increase in printing quality, a
reduction on machine cost and an increase in knowledge shared by the
open hardware community. The purpose of this paper is to explore the
development of a new Open Hardware printer project to address these
points.
Design/methodology/approach - The authors have designed and constructed
a low-cost photopolymer-based 3D printer called BeamMaker. The printer
is connected to a host computer and a digital-light-processing
projector. This work details the design process and how improvements
were implemented to reach good printing quality. The authors provide
public access to the instructions, software, source code, parts list,
user manual and STL and CAD files.
Findings - The BeamMaker printer can build objects with a high surface
quality that is comparable to the quality obtained by industrial
photopolymer-based 3D printers. When testing the ability to print a
sample cylinder, the printer shows higher accuracy when compared to
other personal 3D printers. These findings are encouraging considering
the low cost of the system.
Research limitations/implications - The printing failure rate of the
system has not been measured to date. The system requires some
improvements to produce large objects.
Practical implications - The printer cost is just USD380. This is five
to eight times less expensive than popular personal 3D printers
available today. The cost is 30 times less expensive than a personal
photopolymer 3D printer produced by a main commercial company and yet
producing results of similar quality. The authors expect good avenues
for collaboration from the open-source community to continue improving
these systems. Social implications - The high cost of current personal
3D printers prevents users from developing countries from entering into
the open hardware trend. A dramatic reduction in printer cost such as
that explored in this work might contribute to the real democratization
of personal fabrication.
Originality/value - The authors report on the status of three other
photopolymer-based personal 3D printer projects. To the best of the
authors' knowledge, BeamMaker is the first fully open hardware 3D
printer project which uses this technology.}",,{245-255},{3},{20},{2014},{RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL},"{BeamMaker: an open hardware high-resolution digital fabricator for the

the potential for increases in embodied energy. To quantify the
environmental impact of distributed manufacturing using 3D printers, a
life cycle analysis was performed on three plastic products. The
embodied energy and emissions from conventional large-scale production
in low-labor cost countries and shipping are compared to experimental
measurements on a RepRap with and without solar photovoltaic (PV) power
fabricating products with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and
polylactic acid (PLA). The results indicate that the cumulative energy
demand of manufacturing polymer products can be reduced by 41-64\%
(55-74\% with PV) and concomitant emission reductions using distributed
manufacturing with existing low-cost open-source 3D printers when using
<25\% fill PIA. Less pronounced positive environmental results are
observed with ABS, which demands higher temperatures for the print bed
and extruder. Overall, the results indicate that distributed

lower environmental impact than conventional manufacturing for a variety

distributed additive-based manufacturing of high-value objects
technically feasible and offers the potential for widespread
proliferation of mechatronics education and participation. These
self-replicating rapid prototypers (RepRaps) can manufacture
approximately half of their own parts from sequential fused deposition
of polymer feedstocks. RepRaps have been demonstrated for conventional
prototyping and engineering, customizing scientific equipment, and
appropriate technology-related manufacturing for sustainable
development. However, in order for this technology to proliferate like
2-D electronic printers have, it must be economically viable for a
typical household. This study reports on the life-cycle economic
analysis (LCEA) of RepRap technology for an average US household. A new
low-cost RepRap is described and the costs of materials and time to
construct it are quantified. The economic costs of a selection of 20
open-source printable designs (representing less than 0.02\% of those
available), are typical of products that a household might purchase, are
quantified for print time, energy, and filament consumption and compared
to low and high Internet market prices for similar products without
shipping costs. The results show that even making the extremely
conservative assumption that the household would only use the printer to
make the selected 20 products a year the avoided purchase cost savings
would range from about \$300 to \$2000/year. Assuming the 25 h of
necessary printing for the selected products is evenly distributed
throughout the year these savings provide a simple payback time for the
RepRap in 4 months to 2 years and provide an ROI between >200\% and
>40\%. As both upgrades and the components that are most likely to wear
out in the RepRap can be printed and thus the lifetime of the
distributing manufacturing can be substantially increased the
unavoidable conclusion from this study is that the RepRap is an
economically attractive investment for the average US household already.
It appears clear that as RepRaps improve in reliability, continue to
decline in cost and both the number and assumed utility of open-source
designs continues growing exponentially, open-source 3-D printers will
become a mass-market mechatronic device. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

is a critical need for healthcare in both developed and developing
countries. As we gain more insight into the genomic basis of pathogen
infectivity and drug resistance, point-of-care nucleic acid testing will
likely become an important tool for global health. In this paper, we
present an inexpensive, handheld, battery-powered instrument designed to
enable pathogen genotyping in the developing world. Our Microfluidic
Biomolecular Amplification Reader (mBAR) represents the convergence of
molecular biology, microfluidics, optics, and electronics technology.
The mBAR is capable of carrying out isothermal nucleic acid
amplification assays with real-time fluorescence readout at a fraction
of the cost of conventional benchtop thermocyclers. Additionally, the
mBAR features cell phone data connectivity and GPS sample geotagging
which can enable epidemiological surveying and remote healthcare
delivery. The mBAR controls assay temperature through an integrated
resistive heater and monitors real-time fluorescence signals from 60
individual reaction chambers using LEDs and phototransistors. Assays are
carried out on PDMS disposable microfluidic cartridges which require no
external power for sample loading. We characterize the fluorescence
detection limits, heater uniformity, and battery life of the instrument.
As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrate the detection of the HIV-1
integrase gene with the mBAR using the Loop-Mediated Isothermal
Amplification (LAMP) assay. Although we focus on the detection of
purified DNA here, LAMP has previously been demonstrated with a range of
clinical samples, and our eventual goal is to develop a microfluidic
device which includes on-chip sample preparation from raw samples. The
mBAR is based entirely around open source hardware and software, and in
the accompanying online supplement we present a full set of schematics,

constructs over different developmental stages through a novel method
that combines osmotic loading, video microscopy, and uniaxial unconfined
compression testing. This method was previously used to examine
tension-compression nonlinearity in native cartilage. Engineered
cartilage, cultured under free-swelling (FS) or dynamically loaded (DL)
conditions, was tested in unconfined compression in hypertonic and
hypotonic salt solutions. The apparent equilibrium modulus decreased
with increasing salt concentration, indicating that increasing the bath
solution osmolarity shielded the fixed charges within the tissue,
shifting the measured moduli along the tension-compression curve and
revealing the intrinsic properties of the tissue. With this method, we
were able to measure the tensile (401 +/- 83 kPa for FS and 678 +/- 473
kPa for DL) and compressive (161 +/- 33 kPa for FS and 348 +/- 203 kPa
for DL) moduli of the same engineered cartilage specimens. These moduli
are comparable to values obtained from traditional methods, validating
this technique for measuring the tensile and compressive properties of
hydrogel-based constructs. This study shows that engineered cartilage
exhibits tension-compression nonlinearity reminiscent of the native

utilizing only open-source hardware and software solutions and readily
available discrete components is discussed and its performance compared
to a commercial portable colorimeter. Performance is evaluated with
commercial vials prepared for the closed reflux chemical oxygen demand
(COD) method. This approach reduced the cost of reliable closed reflux
COD by two orders of magnitude making it an economic alternative for the
vast majority of potential users. The open-source colorimeter
demonstrated good reproducibility and serves as a platform for further
development and derivation of the design for other, similar purposes
such as nephelometry. This approach promises unprecedented access to

cost of software to the point that it is accessible to most People, the
rise of open-source hardware is Poised to drive down the cost of doing
experimental science to expand access to everyone. To assist in this
aim, this paper introduces a library of open-source 3-D-printable optics
components. This library operates as a flexible, low-cost public-domain
tool set for developing both research and teaching optics hardware.
First, the use of parametric open-source designs using an open-source
computer aided design package is described to customize the optics
hardware for any application. Second, details are provided on the use of
open-source 3 D printers (additive layer manufacturing) to fabricate the
primary mechanical components, which are then combined to construct
complex optics-related devices. Third, the use of the open-source
electronics prototyping platform are illustrated as control for optical
experimental apparatuses. This study demonstrates an open-source optical
library, which significantly reduces the costs associated with much
optical equipment, while also enabling relatively easily adapted
customizable designs. The cost reductions in general are over 97\%, with
some components representing only 1\% of the current commercial
investment for optical products of similar function. The results of this
study make its clear that this method of scientific hardware development
enables a much broader audience to participate in optical
experimentation both as research and teaching platforms than previous
proprietary methods.}",{MAR 27},,{3},{8},{2013},{PLOS ONE},{Open-Source 3D-Printable Optics Equipment},"Zhang, Chenlong and Anzalone, Nicholas C. and Faria, Rodrigo P. and

FireFader consists of only open-source hardware and open-source software

An open-source device driver for the FireFader allows it to be linked to
a computer via USB so that the computer can perform the feedback control
calculations. For example, the computer can simulate the acoustics of a
virtual musical instrument to concurrently synthesize sound and
calculate the motor force as a function of the fader position. The
serial connection over USB increases the latency of the control signal
compared to embedded implementations, but the serial connection
facilitates easier programming via the computer, and the force feedback
can be automatically disabled when the user is not touching the fader.

Was, only a few years ago, confined to universities and electronics
companies having highly specialized human and/or technical resources.
With the advent of open hardware initiatives, engineers, scientists,
hobbyists, and even people with limited electronic skills have been able
to tinker with complex electronic systems. Taking advantage of these
inexpensive and widely available tools and in the context of an
engineering project class for undergraduates, the authors set about
building a working radiosonde prototype from the ground up, based on an
open hardware platform and easily accessible components.
As a result, a fully functional radiosonde has been built that measures,
records, and transmits pressure, temperature, humidity, and wind, plus a
small camera that stores images on a flash card. A release system was
also developed so that the radiosonde can be detached from a balloon
upon reaching a certain height, pressure level, or flight time. Once it
is released., one can attempt the recovery of the radiosonde with the
help of a precalculated trajectory using a numerical mesoscale
forecasting model and visualization software. The performance of the
sonde Was compared with two commercial radiosondes using climate
chambers and two field launches. This paper also discusses some of the
more interesting capabilities foreseeable for such a platform: 1)
collaboration between meteorology and engineering departments in both
education and research, and 2) development of a flexible hardware
platform that allows for an effective way to compare different
commercially available sensors and to easily integrate new prototype
sensors. (Page 187)}",{FEB},{187+},{2},{94},{2013},{BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY},{THE LIFE CYCLE OF A RADIOSONDE},"Flores, Federico and Rondanelli, Roberto and Diaz, Marcos and Querel,

forced to rely on subjective figures such as verification test quality
metrics or just the size of the diagnostic test. This paper has proposed
two new approaches for assessing diagnostic capability of diagnostic
tests for automated bug localization. The first approach relies on
probabilistic simulation of diagnostic experiments. The second
assessment method is based on calculating Hamming distances of the
individual sub-tests in the diagnostic test set. The methods are
computationally cheap and they provide for a measure of confidence in
the localization results and allow estimating impact of the diagnostic
test enhancement. The approach is implemented as a part of an
open-source hardware design and debugging framework zamiaCAD.
Experimental results with an industrial processor design and a set of

The spectrometer system, based on an Ocean Optics USB4000 (300-900nm)
spectrometer, was designed to increase functionality. Typically systems
only record the global horizontal radiation. Our system moves a
fiber-optic cable 0-90 degrees and takes measurements in 9 degree
increments. Additionally, a shadow band allows measurement of the
diffuse component of the radiation at each position. The electronic
controls utilize an Arduino UNO microcontroller to synchronizes the
movement of two PAP bipolar (stepper) motors with the activation of the
spectrometer via an external trigger. The spectrometer was factory

time-triggered communication of real-time data, which seamlessly
integrate with a standard infrastructure using regular best-effort

latency on multi-segmented 1Gbps networks, easy optimization of devices
for specific application scenarios, and rapid prototyping of new

At the same time, a rise in domestic rapid prototyping machines is
observed, but none of these machines use the 3DP process. Therefore, an

machine is discussed and the first experiments are carried out to create

to many other applications, maximal compaction of the powder during
deposition is not desirable, to maintain an open structure the walls of
the printed object. The machine is able to deposit the powder with
adjustable bulk density, which is used to alter the properties of the

by various methods including feature block selection, feed-forward
rotation, motion compensation, failure case detection and filtering. The
second contribution is the improved performance in terms of resolution
and search range achieved by adaptive frame interval and advanced search

parameter selection to fully utilize the hardware resources and optimize
the performance in different contexts. The performance was benchmarked

a particular commercial subsystem with the exact required specific

photoplethysmogram. Except for Matlab, all other software components are
open-source. The hardware design of the optical sensor utilized to
record the signals is also open-source, making the system extremely
affordable with the advantage of flexibility and customization. Precise
timing of the samples allows for proper alignment and delay estimation
between the acquired traces, useful in arterial stiffness studies.

the ability to be expanded to six channels. Further possible expansions
include the addition of custom filtering, on-board data compression and

with social robots is the lack of multiple identical robots that allow
testing with large user groups. Often, the price of these robots
prohibits using more than a handful. A lot of the commercial robots do
not possess all the necessary features to perform specific HRI
experiments and due to the closed nature of the platform, large
modifications are nearly impossible. While open source social robots do
exist, they often use high-end components and expensive manufacturing
techniques, making them unsuitable for easy reproduction. To address
this problem, a new social robotics platform, named Ono, was developed.
The design is based on the DIY mindset of the maker movement, using
off-the-shelf components and more accessible rapid prototyping and
manufacturing techniques. The modular structure of the robot makes it
easy to adapt to the needs of the experiment and by embracing the open
source mentality, the robot can be easily reproduced or further
developed by a community of users. The low cost, open nature and DIY
friendliness of the robot make it an ideal candidate for HRI studies
that require a large user group.}",,{311-320},,{8239},{2013},,{Systems Overview of Ono A DIY Reproducible Open Source Social Robot},"Vandevelde, Cesar and Saldien, Jelle and Ciocci, Maria-Cristina and

MKIDs do not require the complex cryogenic multiplexing electronics used
for similar detectors, such as transition edge sensors, but instead
transfer this complexity to room temperature electronics where they
present a formidable signal processing challenge. In this paper, we
describe the first successful effort to build a readout for a photon

models are predefined, driven by limited parameters that are available
as a user interface. Many times we can see students wanting to use their
creativity to interact instead of becoming the passive observer or
operator.
The active visualization method employs a measurable virtual 3D world
with a time-line, a modeling tool-set and a physics simulation engine
inside a common 3D animation package. The animation process strictly
relies on segments controlled by non-linear function curves locked to
time and therefore it provides an excellent ground to manipulate
transformations without limitations even when those lead to problems.
Students will engage in a creative activity that involves a story with a
given goal by modeling and animating a phenomenon or group of phenomena
that will lead to a problem they do not expect. The students will learn
about a mathematical concept that provides the solution to their
problem. They will integrate the concept and fix the problem to complete
the story.
Although there is a large number of topics and many levels of complexity
where the method can be used at, for example modeling geometries to
calculate volume or grouping large amounts of particles based on certain
attributes, one of the most important elements is the storytelling that
connects all participants.
This work presents an example of using quaternion to adjust the rotation
of a spaceship to change trajectory in order to fly back to the Earth.
The spaceship will be driven to a gimbal lock in Euler angles.}",,{5826-5831},,,{2012},,"{LEARNING MATHEMATICAL CONCEPTS WITH 3D ANIMATION: ACTIVE VISUALIZATION

vehicles. Energy storage is a critical technology for electric vehicles
and to some extent for intermittent renewable energy sources. Battery
life, performance, and cost remain a barrier to widespread use of
battery energy storage. Increasing the number of students researching
these technologies would increase the likelihood of progress.
The process of testing batteries to characterize performance and
durability typically requires the use of specialized equipment that may
be beyond the budget for many educators. Hence, many interested students
may not have access to the tools to perform these experiments.

built a UAV capable of flying under direct manual control and indirect
automatic control. Direct manual control was accomplished via a model
radio-control transmitter, while indirect control accomplished via the
onboard autopilot system. Programmable autonomous flight software,
utilizing global positioning satellites (GPS), controls the autopilot
system. A ground control station (GCS) sends and receives telemetry from
a 2.4GHz modem located in the UAV. The GCS utilized Paparazzi, an
open-source hardware and software autopilot platform, which allows
mission specific flight plans to be created, uploaded, and executed and
monitored during the UAV's flight. Real-time video from the UAV is
transmitted to the GCS via an antenna and receiver. This comprehensive

able to communicate via its radio interface (868Mhz or 2.4Ghz) to its
neighbors. Furthermore, every sensor node is potentially configurable as
a sink node and can exchange data with any other sink node of the whole
SensLAB testbed and/or Internet application. The testbed is designed to
achieve reproducibility of experimentation, while also supporting
evaluation of protocols and applications in real world settings. It
allows to monitor transparently, i.e., without any
insertion/modification within the code, any deployed application in
terms of energy consumption or radio activity. The main benefits of
SensLAB for the users are to reduce the costs in terms of:
infrastructure investment, maintenance cost and operating cost. With
SensLAB you can be up and running minutes after you are assigned an
account! SensLAB's main and most important goal is to offer an accurate

explained along with its establishment as an actor-network. Drawing on

essentially based on digital technology, leaving aside the use of
concrete material. Still having excellent simulators of the physical
world, working with concrete material allows the development of
cognitive structures that digital doesn't offer. Moreover, these
didactic resources allow highly participative group dynamics that have
not been yet reached by the existing computers at schools.
Unfortunately, in our view there are two major difficulties for the
presence of these resources in the classroom. The physical technology is
expensive and suffers from constant wear. On the other hand, teachers
arc not accustomed to working in a dynamic classroom with a methodology
of work in a participative group, and have fears about the use of
specific technological equipment. Physical Etoys is a development that
aims to overcome these difficulties.
Physical Etoys facilitates the interaction between inexperienced users
and concrete material such as open hardware devices or popular toys by
providing a powerful and intuitive visual programming system in order to
explore and learn science in an enjoyable way. The objective of this
paper is to introduce a new module of Physical Etoys which aims to

thriving developer-community, where developers around the world

Contributed Designs{''} at NetFPGA.org. But creating an ``open-source

open-source projects. Designing hardware is much more time consuming and
more error prone than designing software, and so demands a process that
is more focussed on verifying that a module really works as advertised,
else others will be reluctant to use it. We have designed a novel
process for contributing new designs. Each contributed design is
specified entirely by a set of tests it passes. A developer includes a
list of tests that their design will pass, along with an executable set
of tests that the user can check against. Through this process, we hope
to establish the right expectations for someone who reuses a design, and
to encourage sound design practices with solid, repeatable and
integrated testing. In this paper we describe the philosophy behind our

This paper is intended to show how the development of GRA compliant

establishing a standard for Above 2 GHz SATCOM Terminal modules. The
paper will also describe plans to develop and apply tools, products and
solutions to validate the GRA.
The paper describes the process associated with engaging industry in
developing the GRA. Functional Decomposition, validating the GRA through
a prototype, creating the GRA as a standard for the Army HC3 Program,
and managing to that architecture and standard in a development
environment. The paper also describes how GRA validation through use of
DSM tools, such as LATTIX, will aid in the development and testing of a
GRA Hardware and Software Interface Test Development Environment
designed to allow a GRA module developer to develop, interface, and test
interface applications to the GRA compatible open hardware/software
interfaces. Full documentation shall be developed for all open hardware
and software interfaces, sufficient to develop applications with minimum
interface or interaction with the module developer. Interface definition
stability over time will be a key factor in the mission success of the
HC3 open system interfaces, so they must be designed with stability and
longevity in mind.
This paper will review alternatives for validation of GRA compliant
modules. Particular emphasis will be placed on DSM techniques. The
interdependencies between modules will be modeled using a DSM so as to
provide a big picture view of GRA. DSM can also be used to model and
expose key design decisions for the entire team. Rules can be
established in the DSM model for GRA compliance to guide a GRA module
developer during development and testing for validation. The use of DSM
to model various hardware and software modules in the HBHT will create a
common artifact that can be shared across various teams with different
skills and domains of expertise. DSM can also be used to analyze the
impact of change. Over time, DSM will provide a blue print of the

created a need for hardware and software that can be customized for

relatively large sample volumes and protein concentrations, it is
difficult using this technique to determine protein content for multiple

open source hardware platform combining flow cytometry- and bead-based
antibody capture that is capable of detecting multiple analytes from a

concentrations of murine recombinant interleukin (IL)-1, 1 beta, IL-6,
and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha were added either singly or as a
mixture of all three to whole brain homogenates containing known
quantities of total protein. Spiked samples were assayed for either a
single cytokine or for multiple cytokines using 1-plex or 3-plex assay
kits, respectively. In whole mouse brain homogenate we recovered between
81\% and 103\% of the recombinant cytokines. We then injected C57BL/6J
mice intraperitoneally with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and
sacrificed them 4 h later. We detected in samples taken from
LPS-stimulated mice 4- to 870-fold increases in serum or spleen cytokine
protein, and 1.5- to 16-fold increases in cytokine protein in discrete
brain regions, relative to protein content in samples obtained from

now. Today, an increasing number of open source solutions enter the
market and become valid alternatives to proprietary and closed
solutions. Examples include operating systems like Linux and
OpenSolaris, back-end solutions (e.g. LAMP - Linux, Apache web server,
MySQL database, and Perl/PHP/Python programming languages - are among
the most well-known and widely used open source software on the
Internet), office applications (e.g. Firefox web browser, Thunderbird
email, GIMP graphics, OpenOffice office suite), and complete enterprise
systems like Compiere (ERP and CRM) and Mambo content management system
(CMS). In addition, a variety of devices increasingly include open
source (e.g. cellular phones, network equipment like routers, and
Asterisk - a complete IP PBX).
The open source culture is about much more than software and includes
open source hardware, views on intellectual properties rights,
completely changes how products are developed and owned, and how
business models are developed.
To decide if open source is something for you, a good understanding of
what open source really means is necessary. This includes legal aspects
(different licenses), availability of support with (hopefully a
thriving) user community and commercial for-pay support options, and
security.
Intellectual properties rights, and the vast number of many types of
open source licenses (e.g. GNU General Public License (GPL) and BSD
License), is one of the more complex areas when using open source. What
can and not can be done, what must be done, and so on, vary between
licenses. One effort to bring some order in all this is the Open Source
Definition (OSD) from Open Source Initiative (OSI) which lists ten
conditions that must be met for an OSI Certified open source license.
Today, many companies have already been forced to either remove or
release as open source code borrowed by developers without properly
complying with licenses. Such ``dirty code{''} is increasingly easy to
detect via compliance tools used by companies doing this as business.
(Not to mention whistle-blowing employees tipping of property owners.)
Searching for dirty code is also increasingly part of due diligence in
mergers and acquisitions and can add costly delays and lawsuits.
The perceived low cost is often a reason for considering open source
solutions but the total costs of development (TCD) including for example
licenses, tools, labor, and support - must be considered from initial
design, to maintenance, all through the end of life of the product.
This paper reviews critical aspects for going open source, including
software and hardware, use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)
alternatives, system design going from a monolithic, single-binary,
firmware to a layered design with operating system, middleware, and user
applications.}",,{761-768},,,{2007},,{An open source(d) controller},"Sarkinen, Johan",inproceedings,ISI:000255834800120,,,,,,,,"{29th International Telecommunications Energy Conference, Rome, ITALY,

(ATE) designers is the area of Synthetic Instrumentation. This
instrumentation, which consists of physically separate building blocks
or modules, provides the opportunity to reduce the system's overall
hardware content by eliminating common hardware functionality located
within each traditional instrument. This modular design provides
opportunities for lower lifecycle cost, smaller physical packages and
increased capabilities through module upgrades. However, the design of
synthetic instrumentation and its integration into an ATE system poses
technical challenges not typically seen with traditional
instrumentation.
Traditional instrument developers are now faced with the challenge of
determining how their existing and future modules, for example a
digitizer or waveform generator, satisfy a portion of the requirements
of a synthetic instrument. ATE developers are challenged to identify the
proper set of modules, primarily Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS), that
together satisfy the system level requirements. In addition, they must
address instrumentation concurrency, synchronization, switching, and
develop a software and hardware architecture that supports future
upgrades as technology advances. Each of these issues requires a strong
system engineering discipline that can develop a robust system
architecture.
In 2002 SEI began a program to integrate synthetic instrumentation that
provided the functionality of a spectrum analyzer, A/D converter,
counter timer, UART and AVMUX into a legacy Air Force Test Station. In
2003 SEI continued with an additional program that consisted of design
and development of a synthetic instrument that provided the
functionality of a power meter, spectrum analyzer, frequency time
interval counter, oscilloscope and digital multi meter. During each of
these programs SEI worked directly with commercial instrument
manufacturers, electrical designers and the military to establish the
system requirements and resulting architecture. This paper will describe
the key technical issues encountered while defining the system
architecture including concurrency, modularity, synchronization, and
maintaining an open hardware and software architecture. In addition, the
resultant system architecture will be described.}",,{434-439},,,{2004},,{Real world applications of synthetic instrumentation},"Brown, S",inproceedings,ISI:000228484700072,,,,,,,"{IEEE Aerosp \& Elect Syst Soc; IEEE Instrumentat \& Measurement Soc;

hardware and software and later use this test-bed for experimenting
various traffic engineering options available with MPLS. We have
constructed a test-bed using Pentium PCs and Linux and used this
test-bed to try a well-known MPLS traffic engineering feature of
separating flows into multiple trunks. The. purpose of this separation
is to experimentally assess the quality of service benefits we can
expect from MPLS networks. We experiment with a hierarchical separation
structure where the first level of separation is based on the transport
layer used (TCP or UDP). This high level separation prevents UDP from
unfairly grabbing the available bandwidth from TCP applications. Since
different applications using TCP have different needs, e.g., some might
want high bandwidth while others are more sensitive to packet delay, the
second level of separation is based on application type. The results
from our open experimental test-bed confirms the intuitive results by
demonstrating better QoS with the flow separation in the MPLS core.}",,{62-70},,{4524},{2001},,{Experimenting with flow and service separation using open MPLS test-bed},"Rosenbaum, F and Jha, S and Hassan, M",inproceedings,ISI:000172292800007,,,,"{Hassan, Mahbub/0000-0002-3417-8590}","{Hassan, Mahbub/AAF-2656-2019

mount a modernized radar prototype at Camaguey Meteorological Center,
incorporating computer control and data acquisition hardware to achieve
fully unmanned operation. Modernization of conventional weather radars
is now possible within a small budget using open hardware and software
architectures. Our Primary Processor ``ELBRUS{''} (Signal Processor +
Radar Controller) makes use of available computer cards and commercial
PC systems. The system architecture was designed with a particular
stress on software. All functions that could be handled within the Data
Acquisition Computer have been put there. Also, a versatile Product
Generator and Processing System were developed. Vests processor Vesta
RPG and its front end application Vesta\textbackslash{}Process deal with
product and composite generation, data base management and web server
links. They function in a server-client fashion using standard
protocols. Results obtained with this prototype are now being extended
to other 6 radars under a National Program for the modernization of the
Cuban Weather Radar Network, which also includes composition and
distribution of the products.

evolving GPS requirements and capabilities, both in the commercial and
military markets, there is a need for a flexible open architecture GPS
receiver that would support laboratory development testing of GPS
receiver design concepts, integration schemes, and GPS applications. The
experience of the Central Engineering Activity (CEA) GPS Laboratory at
NRaD San Diego supports the need for such a receiver. The special
investigations and R\&D GPS projects conducted by NRaD frequently
require novel integration or data collection capabilities. These would
only be readily available in a flexible receiver with a high degree of
adaptability to the laboratory's ever-changing needs. The GPS
Integration Receiver-Programmable (GPS-PRO) receiver, which utilizes an
open hardware and software architecture, provides the necessary
flexibility to perform this function.
The GPS-PRO uses Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) hardware, an open
architecture for external sensors, external communications and control,
digital control, open software architecture, functional breakout points,
and an upgradable daughter board concept for application specific
systems. Such a receiver configuration provides the flexibility to
interchange or insert new hardware or software modules in order to
evaluate their performance in a controlled environment or provide an
integrated system solution. The GPS-PRO flexible (programmable)
functionality allows for its use as a design tool for R\&D and hardware
in-the-loop testing, application specific tailoring for low cost, small
size customer demands, while providing benchmark performance
capabilities.}",,{665-674},,,{1997},,"{GPS integration receiver-programmable (GPS-PRO) - Open architecture
