The optical rotation angle is determined by measuring the phase difference between two harmonically modulated polarised laser beams – an ‘object beam’ that passes through the sample under test and a ‘reference beam’ that bypasses the sample. The complete polarimeter may be assembled from low cost off-the-shelf parts for less than £300 (UK Sterling). Data acquisition and analysis are carried out on a microcontroller running an efficient algorithm based on the sliding Discrete Fourier Transform. Despite its low cost, the polarimeter is a fully automatic, research-grade instrument with an accuracy of ±0.0013° and a precision of ±0.0028° – comparable to far costlier commercial instruments. The polarimeter’s ease of use, compact size, fast measurement times and high angular resolution make it a capable and versatile tool for analytical science, while its low cost means it is ideally suited for use in resource-constrained environments and process monitoring.

However, the focused skill sets of researchers who aim to facilitate their own research limit FOSH complexity. The most expensive research equipment normally requires an interdisciplinary team. To overcome this complexity barrier and obtain large returns on investment for research funders by replacing the most expensive proprietary research equipment with FOSH, new development funding mechanisms are needed. To guide such research policy, this paper provides the first analysis of the strategic national benefit of applying the FOSH approach to major research equipment for any nation. The results of an example analysis for a single nation indicate Finland's science funders could save between 2.84–27.7m€/year directly on scientific equipment purchases if research hardware is converted to FOSH and the nation would likely garner the well-established concomitant benefits of increased research innovation within their economy. Finally, a detailed generalized model for determining national research policy in hardware development is derived and research policy mechanisms for accelerating FOSH deployment and greater accessibility to research equipment are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Department of Electronics and Nanoengineering, School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland; Department of Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering, School of Chemical Engineering, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland; Department of Materials Science & Engineering and Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Michigan Technological University, 1400 Townsend, Houghton, MI, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081018523&doi=10.1016%2fj.techfore.2020.119986&partnerID=40&md5=23466d62ddcc6d45445f1e3ba6ad88c7,cited By 0,119986,10.1016/j.techfore.2020.119986,,155,2020,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,Towards national policy for open source hardware research: The case of Finland,"Heikkinen, I.T.S. and Savin, H. and Partanen, J. and Seppälä, J. and Pearce, J.M.",article,Heikkinen2020,,"Economics, Economics of science;  Open sources;  Open-source hardwares;  Research expenditure;  Research tools, Open systems, accessibility;  economic policy;  equipment;  hardware;  public spending;  research;  technology policy, Finland",Economics of science;  Equipment;  Open source;  Open source hardware;  Research expenditures;  Research tools,,,,

Samples were instrumentally processed in a relatively short time, and neither an intentional reduction of the linear flow rate nor an unconventional fluorescence instrument were required. Through the inclusion of external circuitry based on open-source hardware, the occurrence time of each individual fluorescence intensity reading was recorded. For the reported instrumental setup, irregular signal sampling was verified. In order to consider samples-specific time measurements, the PARAFAC (Parallel Factor Analysis) algorithm, and the derived APARAFAC (Augmented-PARAFAC) strategy, were adapted. The functional information was employed during the computational stages, through the development and implementation of smoothing strategies. To tackle differences between the rate of spectral acquisition and the rate of change in the concentration of the mobile fluorophores, Expectation Maximization was implemented. Data from samples with one calibrated analyte (Vitamin B6-Pyridoxine), in presence of uncalibrated interferents, were modeled. In order to preserve the original data structure, unfolding data operations were minimized. The resolved profiles of all species were in agreement with the corresponding chromatographic and spectral references. Results suggest that the effects derived from the loss of trilinearity previously reported in the literature for LC-EEM data, depend on interpretation and subsequent modeling of the data. The reported strategies can be useful with other flow techniques and kinetics. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Instituto de Investigación en Señales, Sistemas e Inteligencia Computacional, sinc(i), FICH-UNL/CONICET, Ciudad Universitaria UNL, Santa Fe, S3000ZAA, Argentina; Cátedra de Química Analítica II, FBCB-UNL, Ciudad Universitaria UNL, Santa Fe, S3000ZAA, Argentina; Cátedra de Bromatología y Nutrición, FBCB-UNL, Ciudad Universitaria UNL, Santa Fe, S3000ZAA, Argentina; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET), Godoy Cruz 2290, Buenos Aires, C1425FQB, Argentina",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079368702&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemolab.2020.103961&partnerID=40&md5=20f94831b29f60027cfe9a635347dffe,cited By 0,103961,10.1016/j.chemolab.2020.103961,,199,2020,Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems,Chemometric handling of spectral-temporal dependencies for liquid chromatography data with online registering of excitation-emission fluorescence matrices,"Siano, G.G. and Vera Candioti, L. and Giovanini, L.L.",article,Siano2020,CILSE,"pyridoxine, Article;  concentration (parameter);  excitation emission fluorescence matrix;  flow rate;  fluorescence analysis;  liquid chromatography;  mathematical model;  online system;  parallel factor analysis;  priority journal;  process development;  signal processing;  validation study",Excitation-Emission fluorescence matrices;  Liquid chromatography;  Loss of trilinearity;  Multi-way data analysis;  Open-source;  Third-order data,,,,

Synthetic biology is also growing in many developing countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America, where it could have a large economic impact by helping its use of genetic biodiversity in order to boost existing industries. Starting in 2011, Argentine synthetic biology developed along an idiosyncratic path. In 2011–2012, the main focus was not exclusively research but also on community building through teaching and participation in iGEM, following the template of the early “MIT school” of synthetic biology. In 2013–2015, activities diversified and included society-centered projects, social science studies on synthetic biology and bioart. Standard research outputs such as articles and industrial applications helped consolidate several academic working groups. Since 2016, the lack of a critical mass of researchers and a funding crisis were partially compensated by establishing links with Latin American synthetic biologists and with other socially oriented open technology collectives. The TECNOx community is a central node in this growing research and technology network. The first four annual TECNOx meetings brought together synthetic biologists with other open science and engineering platforms and explored the relationship of Latin American technologies with entrepreneurship, open hardware, ethics and human rights. In sum, the socioeconomic context encouraged Latin American synthetic biology to develop in a meandering and diversifying manner. This revealed alternative ways for growth of the field that may be relevant to other developing countries. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Departamento de Fisiología y Biología Molecular y Celular, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas.

Unfortunately, this line of research is significantly hindered by the lack of experimental systems and modifiable hardware frameworks. This work proposes BYOC, a ""Bring Your Own Core"" framework that is specifically designed to enable heterogeneous-ISA and heterogeneous system research. BYOC is an open-source hardware framework that provides a scalable cache coherence system, that includes out-of-the-box support for four different ISAs (RISC-V 32-bit, RISC-V 64-bit, x86, and SPARCv9) and has been connected to ten different cores. The framework also supports multiple loosely coupled accelerators and is a fully working system supporting SMP Linux. The Transaction-Response Interface (TRI) introduced with BYOC has been specifically designed to make it easy to add in new cores with new ISAs and memory interfaces. This work demonstrates multiple multi-ISA designs running on FPGA and characterises the communication costs. This work describes many of the architectural design trade-offs for building such a flexible system.

The robot joints are actuated through five direct current motors coupled to optical encoders. Each encoder signal is fed to a proportional integral derivative controller with anti-windup that employs the motor velocity provided by a state observer. The motion controller works with only two open-architecture Arduino Mega boards, which carry out data acquisition of the optical encoder signals. MATLAB-Simulink is used to implement the controller as well as a friendly graphical interface, which allows the user to interact with the manipulator. The communication between the Arduino boards and MATLAB-Simulink is performed in real-time utilizing the Arduino IO Toolbox.

Although methods and protocols for tissue decellularization are abundant throughout the literature, they can be time intensive and typically require specific overhead in terms of equipment. To reduce these barriers to entry, a functional and reproducible prototype of a tissue infusion/perfusion device (TIPD) has been designed and fabricated using three-dimensional printed parts in conjunction with commercially available components. This TIPD forms a system composed of two peristaltic pumps, two 3-way valves, and a chamber in which tissue is contained, and is controlled by user-customizable software. To increase repeatability among decellularization protocols, an automation function has been integrated into the software, which is able to specify fluid flow rates and define specific valve locations enabling selection of solutions to be introduced into a scaffold over the course of a decellularization process. The prototype has been tested for proof of concept through infusion and perfusion decellularization of skeletal muscle and intact kidneys, respectively, and has shown successful removal of cellular content while maintaining an intact ultrastructure. In an effort to increase the reproducibility of experimental designs and to promote an open source hardware initiative in the field of tissue engineering, a novel device was conceptualized and prototyped with printable part files made available for its fabrication in tandem with instructions for assembly. Repeatable methods for decellularization are essential for achieving consistent substrates between batches, laboratories, and facilities. To meet this end, an automatable tissue infusion/perfusion device composed of three-dimensional printed parts and commercially available components has been prototyped and tested. Materials and instructions for its assembly have been made available in an effort to reduce variability among equipment as well as to provide a platform on which to iterate open-source hardware in tissue engineering. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","Department of Bioengineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States; Department of Plastic Surgery, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States; McGowan Institute of Regenerative Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082097616&doi=10.1089%2ften.tea.2019.0209&partnerID=40&md5=e43a5c399ff1144578878d6b6e879ef4,cited By 0,,10.1089/ten.tea.2019.0209,5-6,26,2020,Tissue Engineering - Part A,"Design and Fabrication of an Automatable, 3D Printed Perfusion Device for Tissue Infusion and Perfusion Engineering","Schilling, B.K. and Lamberti, K.K. and Snowden, M.J. and Baker, J.S. and Byrd, K. and Komatsu, C. and Solari, M.G. and Marra, K.G.",article,Schilling2020253,,"Bioreactors;  Clinical research;  Fabrication;  Flow of fluids;  Muscle;  Open source software;  Open systems;  Tissue engineering, Automation functions;  Cellular content;  Decellularization;  Extracellular matrices;  Open-source hardwares;  Peristaltic pump;  Proof of concept;  Reproducibilities, 3D printers, animal tissue;  Article;  controlled study;  decellularization;  equipment design;  extracellular matrix;  fluid flow;  fused deposition modeling;  infusion;  kidney tissue;  male;  nonhuman;  perfusion;  priority journal;  proof of concept;  quadriceps femoris muscle;  rat;  reproducibility;  software;  three dimensional printing;  tissue engineering;  ultrastructure;  Yorkshire pig",bioreactor;  decellularization;  extracellular matrix;  fused filament fabrication;  open source hardware,253-264,,,

Most pump parts are made on a 3D printer. Other parts (lead screw, guide rods, stepper motor, bearings, electronic components) are purchased in specialized stores. The control panel is based on the Arduino UNO. Device interaction, any settings changes, and operating mode selection are carried out using the LCD Keypad Shield (no computer connection required). The program for the microcontroller is written in Arduino IDE. Assembling the syringe pump takes several hours and requires almost no soldering. Universal clamp allows installing any syringe with a diameter of 6 to 25 mm. The syringe pump can both infuse the liquid and refill the empty syringe. To evaluate the analytical characteristics, a 10-mL glass syringe (Kloehn) was used. The dispensed volume was 1 and 5 mL. The systematic error was less than 0.1%, and the random one was less than 3 μL.

Extending visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) with other modalities such as an inertial measurement unit (IMU) can boost robustness and accuracy. However, for a tight sensor fusion, accurate time synchronization of the sensors is often crucial. Changing exposure times, internal sensor filtering, multiple clock sources and unpredictable delays from operation system scheduling and data transfer can make sensor synchronization challenging. In this paper, we present VersaVIS, an Open Versatile Multi-Camera Visual-Inertial Sensor Suite aimed to be an efficient research platform for easy deployment, integration and extension for many mobile robotic applications. VersaVIS provides a complete, open-source hardware, firmware and software bundle to perform time synchronization of multiple cameras with an IMU featuring exposure compensation, host clock translation and independent and stereo camera triggering. The sensor suite supports a wide range of cameras and IMUs to match the requirements of the application. The synchronization accuracy of the framework is evaluated on multiple experiments achieving timing accuracy of less than 1 ms. Furthermore, the applicability and versatility of the sensor suite is demonstrated in multiple applications including visual-inertial SLAM, multi-camera applications, multi-modal mapping, reconstruction and object based mapping. © 2020 by the authors.

Many assessment methods use assumptions instead of measured data because it is cumbersome, time-intensive, and cost-intensive to acquire up-to-date, on-site measured data. This work bridges this gap by presenting the design of an open-source, wireless sensor network (WSN) that is easy to program, manufacture, modify, and deploy. The version of the WSN presented here measures air temperature, relative humidity, supply and return temperature of hot water from the heating system and the radiators, heat flux through the walls and the windows, luminosity, oil flow, electricity, window opening times, and CO2-concentration. The modularity of the WSN allows it to be extended with the addition of new types of sensors to the existing hardware framework. The data is streamed to an online database, allowing monitoring of the measurements in near real-time. The cost and performance of the sensor network are intended to be as good as or better than the existing solutions. The current cost for one temperature sensor node starts at 116 USD. The observed battery lifetime reaches up to a year for a five-minute sampling interval. The average installation time for a sensor node is 7 min.

Short-term load forecasting models enable prediction of future power consumption, thereby encouraging shifting of loads and optimizing the use of stochastic power sources and stored energy. To make the electric grid system smart and sustainable, two-way communication between the utility and consumers must be set up and the working equipment must respond digitally to the quickly changing electric demand. The proposed work exploits the power of embedded systems to design a low-cost solution for interconnecting electrical and electronic devices, controlled by the intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) paradigms. This work primarily focuses on implementing standard regression and machine learning-based architectures for smart grid load analysis and forecasting. A state of the art ecosystem for a portable load forecasting device is proposed by means of low-cost, open-source hardware that is experimentally found to be functioning with a high degree of accuracy. Further, the performance of the classical and advanced machine learning models, emulated on the device, are analyzed on the basis of various parameters, including error percentage, execution time, CPU core temperatures, and resource utilization.

There remain, however, various challenges with respect to the concept of Industry 4.0 before this new reality is fully integrated into the industrial sector. One such challenge is ensuring security, an essential issue in terms of both management and operational technology involving the configuration and administration of physical equipment. Another is integrating equipment from different manufacturers which must be configured and/or administered with incompatible protocols. Likewise, remote access to systems must be carried out from a browser in the web frame. This paper presents a set of tools, available as a cloud-based service, which facilitates access to the physical equipment located in a business. The access enables the end user to see and/or modify the configuration and management of data in a secure, controlled, organized and collaborative manner. In order to unify different protocols, the service makes use of the Modbus TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) protocol, one of the most commonly used by industry in local networks. The local Modbus communications are encapsulated in the Websocket protocol to make them accessible from the cloud. The tools proposed in this paper are based on open hardware platforms and free software, and they permit local and remote sensors and actuators to be fully and easily accessed.

When motor actuators were used for robot development in the past, it was difficult to find cost-effective commercial products. Open-source motor controllers, recently developed with the collaboration of many people, have exhibited phenomenal growth as their performance is now comparable to those of commercial products and their price is cheaper. In this study, we utilized an open-source Vedder electronic speed controller (VESC), originally developed for electric skateboards, as a general-purpose motor controller for robot control. The high-speed, high-torque, and high-output VESC was hardware-upgraded to enable more accurate current control, and advanced position and speed control algorithms were developed to produce Myongji-VESC (MJ-VESC), a general-purpose motor controller for multiaxis robot systems. To evaluate its current, speed, and position control performances, MJ-VESC was applied to an open-source planetary geared actuator that can be fabricated with a 3D printer.

These technological and economical changes are pushing companies to reinvent themselves to develop products that are cheaper, better and of good quality than competitors. An appealing avenue for these companies is to use open hardware solutions in the development of their new products. However, product development processes used nowadays are not suited to exploit the full potential of open hardware. This work addresses this issue by first performing an in-depth assessment of the academic literature on product innovation processes and later proposing a product development process based on open technologies. The process introduces a new product development rationale that includes four phases: the first phase is looking for opportunities, which involves generating opportunities and creative ideas. The second phase is the opportunity assessment phase, which consists of selecting and capturing opportunities. The third phase is the validation of opportunities phase through technical feasibility, client desirability and sustainability. The fourth phase is engineering design, which includes concept generation, prototyping testing, and product manufacturing. The developed process hopes to open the way for businesses, especially in emerging countries like Morocco, to be competitive on the market by helping them designing superior products based on open technologies. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Laboratory of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Science and Technology of Fez, Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University, Fez, Morocco",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083010160&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-27146-6_57&partnerID=40&md5=b5d0dac4a8923897990938fdb29145c4,cited By 0,,10.1007/978-3-030-27146-6_57,,,2020,Lecture Notes in Mechanical Engineering,Product Development Process Based on Open Technologies,"Akerdad, M. and Aboutajeddine, A. and El Majdoubi, M.",article,Akerdad2020524,,,Open technology;  Product design process;  Prototyping,524-532,9783030271459,"Aifaoui N., Affi Z., Benamara A., Chouchane M., Abbes M.S., Walha L., Haddar M., Chaari F., Romdhane L.",

Using low-cost, open-source hardware, we applied the TIE to living algal cells to measure their effect on OPL. We obtained OPL values that were repeatable within species and differed by distinct amounts depending on the species being measured.

One of the most fundamental questions relating to these phenomena is why developers contribute their private resources to these public goods. While this question has been discussed, theorized, and empirically investigated in the context of OSS, there has been no research so far in the context of OSH. Can we really assume the motivations behind the development of the OSH to be the same as those behind OSS? Based on the self-determination theory (SDT), we provide original insights into the motivations behind contributions to OSH development. We collected data from the most common and active 3D printing communities, which are the main loci of OSH development. We thus have a unique cross-sectional data set with participants from over 30 different countries using all kinds of different OSH platforms. Our analysis reveals several important findings: firstly, the motivations are in some aspects very similar to those in open source software notwithstanding different possibilities, hurdles, and incentives regarding the OSS and OSH. Above all, enjoyment-based intrinsic motivation is a major factor affecting contribution levels. Secondly, among internalized extrinsic motivations, expected private benefits through improving own skills stands out. Thirdly, different factors of internalized extrinsic motivations can have different moderating effects on the effect of enjoyment-based intrinsic motivation. Given the imminent changes in business models throughout manufacturing industries in order to adapt to the challenge that OSH will increasingly pose, our findings have important implications not only for OSH communities and 3D development platforms, but also for businesses that want and probably soon have to engage in open innovation. © 2018 The Authors R&D Management published by RADMA and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","School of Business Administration and Economics, University of Osnabruck, Rolandstr. 8, 29/206, Osnabruck, 49078, Germany; Faculty of Business, Economics and Social Sciences, University of Hamburg, Von-Melle-Park 9, Hamburg, B530, 20146, Germany",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85057756137&doi=10.1111%2fradm.12348&partnerID=40&md5=87a3df3c344b423815e0df7a93b75255,cited By 1,,10.1111/radm.12348,1,50,2020,R and D Management,Why makers make what they make: motivations to contribute to open source hardware development,"Hausberg, J.P. and Spaeth, S.",article,Hausberg202075,,,,75-95,,,

For emerging technologies, such as ambient ionization mass spectrometry (AIMS), the assembly of a functional prototype is often more time-consuming than developing the actual probes. The modification of commercial platforms for testing hardware is usually not possible due to technical and legal restrictions. Therefore, we designed a robotic platform, which is based on RepRap 3D-printer components, and therefore easy to adopt for custom set-ups. Adjustable rails in an aluminium frame construction facilitate the mounting of additional parts such as sensors, probes, or optical components. The Open LabBot uses industry-standard G-code for its control. Its simple syntax facilitates the programming of the movement. We developed two programs for the robot control and mass spectrometry imaging: “LABI-Imaging” for synchronizing the robot movements and MS data acquisition and “RmsiGUI”, a software solution for the complete AIMS workflow. We proved the functionality of the system by the automated sampling and classification of essential oils with a PlasmaChip probe. Further, we performed an AIMSI imaging experiment of a lime slice with laser desorption low-temperature plasma (LD-LTP) ionization, demonstrating the integration of the complete workflow in RmsiGUI.

37,Scopus,Article,IEEE Trans Comput,English,,00189340,IEEE Computer Society,,"With the Internet-of-Things (IoT), embedded devices are required to execute multiple applications under severe energy and performance constraints. The traditional approaches to control the energy-budget and the energy-allocation by means of the DVFS actuator are diminishing their effectiveness for two reasons. First, technological advancements prevent further voltage scaling. Second, the strict low-power requirements are moving the design of such control strategies from software- to hardware-level. This paper proposes a unified control-theoretic scheme to coordinate the design of energy-budget and energy-allocation solutions for low-power platforms. The scheme allows the integration of any performance policy, while still ensuring the theoretic exponential stability of the overall controller. We integrated the proposed control scheme into an open-hardware quad-core RISC architecture also demonstrating the use of two actuators, Dynamic Frequency Scaling, and Dynamic Clock Gating. The design has been implemented on the Nexys4-DDR board featuring a Xilinx Artix- 7 100t FPGA. We report an area occupation of the controller limited to 0.86% (FFs) and 5.3% (LUTs) of the target FPGA chip. Collected results show that the average efficiency in exploiting the imposed budget is 98.27%. The average budget overflow is 1.43mW. Last, the performance utility loss due to the control scheme is 1.87% on average.

41,Scopus,Article,Commun ACM,English,,00010782,Association for Computing Machinery,,"Industry is building larger, more complex, manycore processors on the back of strong institutional knowledge, but academic projects face difficulties in replicating that scale. To alleviate these difficulties and to develop and share knowledge, the community needs open architecture frameworks for simulation, chip design, and software exploration that support extensibility, scalability, and configurability, alongside an established base of verification tools and supported software. In this article, we present OpenPiton, an open source framework for building scalable architecture research prototypes from one core to 500 million cores. OpenPiton is the world's first open source, general-purpose, multithreaded manycore processor, and framework. OpenPiton is highly configurable, providing a rich design space spanning a variety of hardware parameters that researchers can change. OpenPiton designs can be emulated on FPGAs, where they can run full-stack multiuser Debian Linux. OpenPiton is designed to scale to very large core fabrics, enabling researchers to measure operating system, compiler, and software scalability. The mature codebase reflects the complexity of an industrial-grade design and provides the necessary scripts to build new chips, making OpenPiton a natural choice for computer-aided design (CAD) research. OpenPiton has been validated with a 25-core chip prototype, named Piton, and is bolstered by a validation suite that has thousands of tests, providing an environment to test new hardware designs while verifying the correctness of the whole system. OpenPiton is being actively used in research both internally to Princeton and in the wider community, as well as being adopted in education, industry, and government settings. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

We present a system of open source hardware and software for fiber photometry data acquisition consisting of a compact, low cost, data acquisition board built around the Micropython microcontroller, and a cross platform graphical user interface (GUI) for controlling acquisition and visualising signals. The system can acquire two analog and two digital signals, and control two external LEDs via built in LED drivers. Time-division multiplexed illumination allows independent readout of fluorescence evoked by different excitation wavelengths from a single photoreceiver signal. Validation experiments indicate this approach offers better signal to noise for a given average excitation light intensity than sinusoidally-modulated illumination. pyPhotometry is substantially cheaper than commercial hardware filling the same role, and we anticipate, as an open source and comparatively simple tool, it will be easily adaptable and therefore of broad interest to a wide range of users. © 2019, The Author(s).","Department of Experimental Psychology, Oxford University, Oxford, United Kingdom; Champalimaud Neuroscience Program, Champalimaud Center for the Unknown, Lisbon, Portugal",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062585746&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-019-39724-y&partnerID=40&md5=0d24065787cb3d2f74d80c62ae90d7d4,cited By 1,3521,10.1038/s41598-019-39724-y,1,9,2019,Scientific Reports,pyPhotometry: Open source Python based hardware and software for fiber photometry data acquisition,"Akam, T. and Walton, M.E.",article,Akam2019,,,,,,,

The same principle can be applied to scanning angle interference microscopy (SAIM), where precision control of the scanned laser beam presents unique technical challenges for the builders of custom azimuthal scanning microscopes. Accurate synchronization between the instrument computer, beam scanning system and excitation source is required to collect high quality data and minimize sample damage in SAIM acquisitions. Drawing inspiration from open-source prototyping systems, like the Arduino microcontroller boards, we developed a new instrument control platform to be affordable, easily programmed, and broadly useful, but with integrated, precision analog circuitry and optimized firmware routines tailored to advanced microscopy. We show how the integration of waveform generation, multiplexed analog outputs, and native hardware triggers into a single central hub provides a versatile platform for performing fast circle-scanning acquisitions, including azimuthal scanning SAIM and multiangle TIRF. We also demonstrate how the low communication latency of our hardware platform can reduce image intensity and reconstruction artifacts arising from synchronization errors produced by software control.

Under dynamically changing environments, photovoltaic defects could spontaneously form and develop into fatal faults during the daily operation of photovoltaic plants. To facilitate defect detection with less human intervention, a nondestructive and contactless visual inspection system with the help of unmanned aerial vehicles and edge computing is proposed in this work. Limited by the resources of edge devices and the availability of images of photovoltaic defects for training, we developed an online solution combined with deep learning, data argumentation and transfer learning to properly address the issues of running resource hungry applications on edge devices and lack of training samples faced by the deep learning approaches used in the field. With the reduction of the network depth of the deep convolutional neural network model and the transfer of features from the learned defects, the resource consumption of our proposed approach is significantly reduced, and thus can be used on a wide range of edge devices to complete defect detection in a timely manner with high accuracy.

Unfortunately, building an on-chip network (OCN) that is suitable for a specific SoC design requires the exploration of a large number of design options and involves diverse research methodologies to evaluate performance, area, energy, and timing. In this paper, we propose PyOCN, a unified framework that vertically integrates multiple research methodologies to enable productively exploring the OCN design space. PyOCN is the first comprehensive framework for modeling (e.g., functional-level, cycle-level, and register-transfer-level), testing (e.g., unit testing, integration testing, and property-based random testing), and evaluating (e.g., simulating, generating, and characterizing) on-chip interconnection networks.

However, they suffer from some design issues related to the difficulty to implement them on different hardware platforms without additional efforts. To bridge this gap, recently, the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society has sponsored the publication of the standard IEEE Std 1855-2016 which is aimed at providing the fuzzy community with a well-defined approach to model FRBSs in a hardware-independent way. In order to provide a runnable version of an FRBS that is designed in accordance with the IEEE Std 1855-2016, the open source library Java Fuzzy Markup Language (JFML) has been developed. However, due to hardware and/or software limitations of embedded systems, it is not always possible to run an IEEE Std 1855-2016 FRBS on this kind of systems. The aim of this paper is to overcome this drawback by developing a new JFML module that assists developers in the design and implementation of FRBSs for open hardware–embedded systems. In detail, the module supports several connection types (WiFi, Bluetooth, and USB) in order to make feasible running FRBSs in a remote computer when, due to hardware limitations, it is not possible that they run locally in the embedded systems. The new JFML module is ready for Arduino™ and Raspberry Pi, but it can be easily extended to other hardware architectures. Moreover, the new JFML module allows to automatically generate runnable files on Arduino™ or Raspberry Pi in order to support nonexpert users, that is, users without specific knowledge about embedded systems or without strong programming skills. The use of the new JFML module is illustrated in two case studies. © 2019 The Authors.

56,Scopus,Conference Paper,"Int. Inf. Softw. Eng. Conf.: Innov. Technol. Digit. Transform., IISEC - Proc.",English,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"As is commonly known, hardware in a computer system requires a processor to run the operating system. The primary architectures that form the basis of most processors are CISC and RISC. CISC includes long sub-level commands for effective memory management and simple compiler implementations to be developed. Thus CISC has a complex set of commands; hence the name Complex Instruction Set Computer. On the other hand, CISC has had backward compatibility since the 1970s. Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC), the other popular architecture, simplifies command sets and handles access to memory with load-store commands. Since the instruction set is simplified, the hardware runs faster. In addition, RISC-based processors contain less chip-sets and may be designed faster. Currently, with the prevalence of the Internet of Things (IoT), the demand for RISC architectures has increased and its usage in embedded devices has become widespread. The ARM processor is a successful example of the RISC architecture adaptation. However, ARM processor production has certain license term limitations and contains a few design flaws in its architecture [1]. In 2010, the RISC-V processor architecture, which was developed as an open source instruction set at Berkeley University, paves the way for open source hardware in terms of its BSD license and design professionalism. As a result, it will be possible to produce their own processors for communities and organizations without license restrictions. In this paper, we discuss the building blocks of the development life-cycle of an open source operating system on the RISC-V architecture. As an operating system base, we implement MILIS Linux, an open source operating system development project. It has an independent user space and its own package manager.

Direct CT guidance allows physicians to localize tumours quickly; however, needle insertion is still performed by hand. This system is mounted to a fully active motion stage superior to the patient's head and teleoperated by a radiologist. Unlike other similar robots, this robot's fully serial-link approach uses a unique combination of belt and cable drives for high-transparency and minimal-backlash, allowing for an expansive working area and numerous approach angles to targets, all while maintaining a small in-bore cross-section of less than 16cm2. Simulations verified the system's expansive collision free work-space and ability to hit targets across the entire chest, as required for lung cancer biopsy. Targeting error was on average &lt; 1mm on a teleoperated accuracy task, illustrating the system's sufficient accuracy to perform biopsy procedures. While this system was developed for lung biopsies, it can be easily modified for other CT-guided needle based procedures.

Specifically three kind of Arduino Board (Arduino UNO, Arduino Mega y Arduino Due) and two ESP based board (ESP8622 and ESP32) are evaluated and compared. The comparison is based on the execution time of mathematical operations and a function required for data acquisition or digital control and includes (i) digital ports writing, (ii) analog signal acquisition, (iii) execution of mathematic operation in integer and float format, and (iv) the execution of the data processing code. The execution time is measured by using a methodology which is simple to implement for any other digital device. Because of each platform uses its own Arduino DUE library to generate the assembly code for its own microcontroller, the instructions adopted for both generating the actions to measure and generating the testing signals are written using Arduino IDE commands and using instructions that any entry-level user may adopt.

However, experimental research efforts in this field are often stymied by the lack of open hardware, open-source software, and affordable testbeds accessible by the research community at large, who is now forced to perform simulation-based research or – if at all possible – small-scale, ad hoc experiments. After discussing existing research challenges in mmWave and THz testbeds, in this paper we propose MillimeTera, a vision for a new generation of disruptive experimental platforms that will radically transform the status quo in mmWave and THz research. We next discuss our preliminary hardware and software efforts, and finally provide a roadmap of our main design and development goals in the years to come. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

This has lately been applied in the educational domain, aimed to better support learners during the learning process. For this purpose, we have developed the AICARP (Ambient Intelligence Context-aware Affective Recommender Platform) infrastructure, which detects changes in the emotional state of the user and provides personalized multisensorial support to help manage the emotional state by taking advantage of ambient intelligence features. We have developed a third version of this infrastructure, AICARP.V3, which addresses several problems detected in the data acquisition stage of the second version, (i.e., intrusion of the pulse sensor, poor resolution and low signal to noise ratio in the galvanic skin response sensor and slow response time of the temperature sensor) and extends the capabilities to integrate new actuators. This improved incorporates a new acquisition platform (shield) called PhyAS (Physiological Acquisition Shield), which reduces the number of control units to only one, and supports both gathering physiological signals with better precision and delivering multisensory feedback with more flexibility, by means of new actuators that can be added/discarded on top of just that single shield. The improvements in the quality of the acquired signals allow better recognition of the emotional states. Thereof, AICARP.V3 gives a more accurate personalized emotional support to the user, based on a rule‐based approach that triggers multisensorial feedback, if necessary. This represents progress in solving an open problem: develop systems that perform as effectively as a human expert in a complex task such as the recognition of emotional states. © 2019 by the authors.

In the past decade various open source syringe pump designs have accelerated scientific research and exploration by reducing costs and introducing new ideas. To further expand the capabilities of open source syringe pumps we introduce a novel syringe pump design, the Ystruder. It features a load cell to monitor the piston force. This capability enables clog detection as well as development of advanced dosing algorithms. The Ystruder can be monitored wirelessly through a browser-based interface that is integrated into the embedded system. The design is modular and simple which facilitates different syringe and motor configurations, to meet a wide range of use cases. Finally, the Ystruder is not limited to functioning solely as a pump as it can be integrated into a wide range of devices such as three-dimensional motion systems. Here the dosing accuracy and repeatability of the Ystruder are quantified, and we demonstrate its functionality both as a syringe pump and a paste extruder for 3D printing. © 2019 The Authors","Department of Mechanical Engineering, Aalto University School of Engineering, Espoo, Finland; School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland; Department of Materials Science & Engineering and Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072947448&doi=10.1016%2fj.ohx.2019.e00080&partnerID=40&md5=ad37a9f8f7ff2ebfadeddf264263f506,cited By 0,e00080,10.1016/j.ohx.2019.e00080,,6,2019,HardwareX,Ystruder: Open source multifunction extruder with sensing and monitoring capabilities,"Klar, V. and Pearce, J.M. and Kärki, P. and Kuosmanen, P.",article,Klar2019,,"Extruders;  Monitoring;  Open systems;  Pumps;  Syringes, 3-D printing;  Open hardware;  Open-source hardwares;  Sensing;  Syringe pumps, 3D printers",3D printing;  Additive manufacturing;  Extruder;  Monitoring;  Open hardware;  Open source hardware;  Paste extruder;  Sensing;  Syringe pump,,,,

The proposed framework is a modular and cost-effective open-source hardware and software platform that is intended to help develop multiagent systems for research and education. Numerous multi-agent platforms have been developed in the literature to date that are used in various robotic applications, such as surveillance, target localization, cooperative estimation, among others. However, most of them are either tailored towards particular applications or driven by expensive software and hardware. The proposed MAFOSS system is developed for robotic applications, where a team of mobile agents (robots) is deployed to achieve a common goal. A major contribution of the MAFOSS system is the development of an open-hardware platform for differential-drive mobile robots (herein called 'eduMOD' mobile robots). The software architecture of the current framework mostly relies on the robot operating system (ROS). Regardless of internal hardware and/or software architecture, appropriate actions can be applied to actuators of an individual or a team of mobile agents for controlling their motions.

While implemented as a proof-of-concept of a treatment system to evaluate existing waste water technology, the production model can take full advantage of the internet of things concepts that would allow for proactive maintenance scheduling, optimized treatment time to meet available community electrical loads, and remote troubleshooting and operation to name a few. © 2019 IEEE.","University of Alaska Anchorage, Civil Engineering Department, Anchorage, AK, United States; University of Portland, Computer Science, Portland, OR, United States; Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium (ANTHC), Civil Engineering, Anchorage, AK, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082675422&doi=10.1109%2fGHTC46095.2019.9033080&partnerID=40&md5=4b2019af679e51594fdd00b6cb7ab46a,cited By 0,9033080,10.1109/GHTC46095.2019.9033080,,,2019,"2019 IEEE Global Humanitarian Technology Conference, GHTC 2019",Open-Source IoT Framework for Mobile Household Water Reuse System,"Dotson, A.D. and Cenek, M. and Michaelson, G.",conference,Dotson2019,,"Computer software reusability;  Cost effectiveness;  Industrial internet of things (IIoT);  Industrial waste treatment;  Open source software;  Open systems;  Remote control;  Sewers;  Wastewater reclamation;  Wastewater treatment;  Water conservation;  Water treatment, arduino;  Components off the shelves;  maker space;  Mobile solutions;  Open-source hardwares;  Proactive maintenance;  Production modeling;  Water reuse systems, Industrial water treatment",arduino;  humanitarian sanitation;  IoT;  maker space;  mobile solutions;  raspbery pi;  water treatment,,9781728117805,,

Most systems available to the public have price tags in the thousands of dollars and their dimensions cannot be easily customized. Current systems have a maximum length of about ten meters, and for a typical greenhouse application that length may not be sufficient. The price of the system increases with an increase in length, and with a base price in the thousands of dollars it becomes impractical to buy a system for such application. Our HyperRail is a modular linear motion system with a repeatability of 2 mm and current top speed of 200 mm/s. This is possible through a stepper motor driver that allows for 1/16th microstepping giving an average of 6180 steps per revolution. An advantage that this system has is its ability to increase or decrease the length of system with minimum effort and only nominal increase in price. The HyperRail can be mounted on a set of tripods or directly on the structure of a building such as a greenhouse. The base price for a three-meter system, on tripods is US$278 and only US$45 for each additional 1.5 m of length. © 2019 The Authors","Openly Published Environmental Sensing (OPEnS) Lab, OR, USA; Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, OR, USA; Department of Biological and Ecological Engineering, Oregon State University, OR, USA",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078706767&doi=10.1016%2fj.ohx.2019.e00081&partnerID=40&md5=0c30ae934010cd927d384ef564612eb5,cited By 0,e00081,10.1016/j.ohx.2019.e00081,,6,2019,HardwareX,"HyperRail: Modular, 3D printed, 1–100 m, programmable, and low-cost linear motion control system for imaging and sensor suites","Lopez Alcala, J.M. and Haagsma, M. and Udell, C.J. and Selker, J.S.",article,LopezAlcala2019,,"3D printers;  Control systems;  Costs;  Greenhouses;  Hyperspectral imaging;  Motion control;  Spectroscopy;  Stepping motors, Agriculture applications;  Environmental sensing;  Linear motion;  Linear motion control;  Linear motion systems;  Minimum efforts;  Open-source hardwares;  Stepper motor drivers, Open systems",Environmental sensing;  Greenhouse sensing;  Hyperspectral Imaging;  Linear motion;  Open source hardware,,,,

Although specifically designed for active textiles, the characterization device is broadly applicable for studying the performance of actuators including but not limited to Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) wires, SMA springs, and electroactive polymers. The characterization device may be operated in several modes that enable a wide variety of experimental protocols to be automated. These modes include but are not limited to automatic displacement and displacement rate mode, automatic force mode, and manual displacement mode. For active textiles that actuate by electrical stimulus or by resistive heating, the electronic system has five independent motor drivers. For each driver, the voltage drop across its outputs and current are measured, enabling the measurement of textile power consumption and other electrical properties. The validation of the Active Textile Characterization Device uses a contractile SMA knitted textile actuated by four motor drivers through resistive heating. Several protocols were successfully conducted to demonstrate the experimental flexibility of the system. During these experiments, knit length, knit tension, current through the knit, voltage drop across the knit, and room temperature were measured with respect to time. © 2019 The Authors","Lafayette College, United States; University of Minnesota, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073984448&doi=10.1016%2fj.ohx.2019.e00083&partnerID=40&md5=1d8ef031e18be5f14d0cf54e128bf4bb,cited By 1,e00083,10.1016/j.ohx.2019.e00083,,6,2019,HardwareX,Open-source experimental setup for investigating the actuation behavior of active textiles,"Utter, B. and Marbaker, R. and Eschen, K. and Abel, J.",article,Utter2019,,"Actuators;  Conducting polymers;  Open systems;  Shape memory effect;  Shape-memory alloy, Displacement modes;  Electrical stimuli;  Electro-active polymers;  Electronic systems;  Experimental protocols;  Materials characterization;  Open-source hardwares;  Shape memory alloy wire, Textiles",Active knitted textiles;  Actuators;  Materials characterization;  Open-source hardware;  Shape memory alloy,,,,

Furthermore, we provide an Android application through which users can easily control the USV via Bluetooth and display the sensor and GPS data the platform generates.

It was shown that electrically stimulating the brain can be used to produce simple visual impressions of light blobs (phosphenes). This technology, using electrodes placed on top of the visual cortex, was successfully used to give blind people some degree of visual impression of their surrounding. However, this perception is very far away from natural sight. For developing the next generation of visual prostheses, real-time closed-loop stimulators are required. Such a stimulator measures the actual neuronal activities and on this basis determines the required stimulation pattern. In addition, there is a desire to shrink the diameter of the applied electrodes and increase their spatial density. This leads to the challenge of designing a system that can produce arbitrary stimulation-patterns with up to ±70 V and with up to 25 mA while measuring neuronal signals with amplitudes in the order of mV. Furthermore, interruptions of the measurements during stimulation should be as short as possible and the system needs to scale to hundreds of electrodes. We discuss how such a system and especially its current pumps and input protection need to be designed and which problems arise. We condense our findings into an example design for which we provide all design files (boards, firmwares and software) as open-source.

Given fundamental power requirements for such communication, burdened mass guidelines and battery technology, this constraint necessitates the continued use of very high frequency (VHF) radio beacons. As such, efforts should be made to mitigate their primary deficiencies: detection range, localization time and localization accuracy. The integration of a radiotelemetry system with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) could significantly improve the capacity for data collection from VHF tags. We present a UAV-integrated radiotelemetry system that relies on open source hardware and software. Localization methods, including signal processing, bearing estimation based on principal component analysis, localization techniques and test results, are discussed. Using a low-power beacon applicable for bats and small birds, testing showed that the improved vantage of the UAV-radiotelemetry system (UAV-RT) provided significantly higher received signal power compared to the low-level flights (maximum range beyond 1.4 km). Flight testing of localization methods showed median bearing errors between 2.3° and 6.8°, with localization errors of between 5% and 14% of the distance to the tag. In a direct comparison to an experienced radiotelemetry user, the UAV-RT system provided bearing and localization estimates with 53% less error. This paper introduces the core functionality and use methods of the UAV-RT system, while presenting baseline localization performance metrics. An associated website hosts plans for assembly and software installation. The methods of UAV-RT use for tag detection will be further developed in future works. For both the detection and localization problems, the mobility of a flying asset drastically reduces tracker time requirements. A 7-min flight would be sufficient to collect five equally spaced bearing estimates over a 1-km transect. The use of a software-defined radio on the UAV-RT system will allow for the simultaneous detection and localization of multiple tags. © 2019 The Authors.

However, physical problems such as excessive heat generation and increasing energy consumption continue to be increasingly present. Inspired by the evolution of the concept of Smart grids, we will approach the implementation of an integrated system for monitoring and measuring electricity consumption variables in data centers using open hardware and software libraries based on industry-wide standards such as Ethernet and the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). Such system is conceived as a basic element for the complete management of a physical Information and Communication Technology infrastructure, since data centers are highly complex elements connected to and representative of Smart grids. For validation, a field-tested hardware and software prototype was developed, one that was capable of performing non-invasive measurements of electric current in data centers and make the data available via network, either in a local infrastructure or in a distributed architecture. Therefore, it could be implemented from small local data centers to huge distributed projects like Smart Grids, securely, inexpensively and highly integrable with other tools and systems. © 2019 IEEE.","University of Brasilia (UnB), Department of Electrical Engineering (ENE), Brazil",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075599345&doi=10.1109%2fWCNPS.2019.8896232&partnerID=40&md5=616b127ca62954089db4e1ab6cca6489,cited By 0,8896232,10.1109/WCNPS.2019.8896232,,,2019,WCNPS 2019 - Workshop on Communication Networks and Power Systems,Design and evaluation of an SNMP-based energy consumption monitoring system for electrical grids,"De Almeida, L.C. and De Sousa, R.T. and Nery, A.S. and Da Silva Filho, D.A. and Canedo, E.D. and Nunes, R.R.",conference,DeAlmeida2019,,"Electric power transmission networks;  Electric variables measurement;  Electricity;  Energy utilization;  Information management;  Internet protocols;  Monitoring;  Software prototyping;  Software testing, Consumption;  Data centers;  Distributed architecture;  Energy consumption monitoring;  Non- invasive measurements;  Simple network management protocols;  Smart grid;  SNMP, Smart power grids",Consumption;  Data Center;  Electricity;  Monitoring;  Smart Grid;  SNMP,,9781728129204,,

Twelve students (n=12) have been enrolled into the methodology of Problem-Based Learning (PBL) to design and implement the mentioned nodes as part of a set of capstone projects. To technical level, each node has been designed using Digital Signal Controllers (dsPICs), the open hardware platform Arduino or FTDI 32-bit microcontrollers as the FT900Q according to the design requirements. Also, it has designed several educational materials in the e-learning tool Xerte and an Algorithm Visualization (AV) tool called DSCBlocks that supported the educational process of the students. The outcomes show that the methodology is suitable to fulfill with the technical and educational requirements of the projects because they enclosed different stages such as problem definition, design strategy, usage of previous knowledge, implementation, debugging and team working.

Conf., IEMCON",English,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"The advent of Internet of Things - IoT - technology has elevated the embedded solutions employment to level never seen before, both in the problem-solving possibilities as in the complexity of the new systems. SoC-based computers such as those used in embedded systems have been under growing attention due to their low-cost, low-power, reduced footprint and high performance characteristics. These features allow small users as well as industries to design, develop and build wide range of applications with efficiency as the common aspect. A number of platforms that integrate this kind of technology were also proposed by different manufacturers, some employing the open hardware concept. Embedded applications spread over a wide range of fields, which make them hard to characterize in a general sense. For this reason, benchmark suites are often used as a tool for system's performance evaluation. However, such suites consist on a large number of different algorithms, which can spend time and energy to run on SoC computers. In order to contribute to the performance assessment of such systems, this paper presents a simple method for comparing different platforms, based on execution time of simple but representative algorithms: sorting, cross-correlation and discrete-cosine transform calculation for vectors. The power consumption was also considered. Six distinct architectures were used as a case study. Several computer experiments were conducted in order to make possible a statistic characterization of different load conditions in distinct platforms, so their comparison can be done in a meaningful way. Results show that the proposed method provides a good estimation of relative system performance, which can be useful as a criterion choice for selecting different embedded platforms. © 2019 IEEE.","Federal University of São João Del-Rei, Department of Technology, Brazil; ATDC Georgia Tech, VeriSolutions, Atlanta, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077970528&doi=10.1109%2fIEMCON.2019.8936161&partnerID=40&md5=d08ca0717f98a7f671dcbbdfc1fc47d6,cited By 0,8936161,10.1109/IEMCON.2019.8936161,,,2019,"2019 IEEE 10th Annual Information Technology, Electronics and Mobile Communication Conference, IEMCON 2019",IoT Embedded Computing Systems Performance Assessment: A Simple Method,"Vale-Cardoso, A.S. and Geny Moreira, M. and Martins, C.H.N. and Leles, M.C.R.",conference,Vale-Cardoso201971,,"Benchmarking;  Discrete cosine transforms;  Electric power utilization;  Embedded systems;  Mobile telecommunication systems;  Programmable logic controllers;  System-on-chip, Computer experiment;  Embedded application;  Embedded computing system;  Embedded programming;  High performance characteristics;  Performance assessment;  Power consumption estimation;  System's performance, Internet of things",Embedded Programming;  Embedded Systems;  IoT;  Performance Assessment;  Power Consumption Estimation;  System on Chip,71-75,9781728125305,"Chakrabarti S., Saha H.N.",

In this work, we aimed to image scanned proton beams with greater flexibility than is provided by previous systems by using an innovative camera triggering solution. The main objective was to synchronize image acquisitions with proton beam deliveries. A 3D detector composed of 3 scientific complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor cameras and a volumetric liquid scintillator (20 ×20× 20 cm)were used. We identified relevant signals from the synchrotron beam delivery system to trigger the cameras. These signals were processed using an open hardware microcontroller and monitored using an oscilloscope. We evaluated the camera triggering scheme by comparing the mean signal intensity and standard deviations for triggered versus non-triggered image acquisitions at 5 energies (161.6, 140.9, 124.0, 100.9, and 85.6 MeV)with 50 spots per energy. The performance of the triggering scheme was further investigated by testing the image intensity variability for 5 energies delivered at 9 different location (2 spots/location). We also measured the background signals for different exposure times (1–1000 ms)using both triggered and non-triggered schemes. The mean signal intensity difference between triggered and non-triggered schemes was 10% ± 0.4% for low SNR (∼20 dB). The image intensity variability was within 2%. The background signal intensity varied by only 0.6% from the shortest exposure time (1 ms)to the longest (1 s). We demonstrated a flexible triggering scheme using an open hardware microcontroller with a camera and scintillator detector system for a spot scanning proton beam, which will enable efficient machine quality assurance and treatment plan verification measurements in the future. © 2019","Department of Radiation Physics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd., Unit 94, HoustonTX  77030, United States; The University of Texas MD Anderson UTHealth Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, 6767 Bertner Ave., HoustonTX  77030, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066260360&doi=10.1016%2fj.nima.2019.05.038&partnerID=40&md5=1af17ddc603f96611e0c6c28e6580af3,cited By 0,,10.1016/j.nima.2019.05.038,,939,2019,"Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research, Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment",A novel imaging scheme for optical cameras used in a quality assurance detector for discrete spot scanning proton beam systems,"Alsanea, F. and Darne, C. and Hojo, Y. and Beddar, S.",article,Alsanea201916,NIMAE,"CMOS integrated circuits;  Image acquisition;  Microcontrollers;  Phosphors;  Proton beam therapy;  Proton beams;  Quality assurance;  Scanning;  Scintillation counters, Background signals;  Liquid scintillator;  Proton therapy;  Scintillator detector;  Signal intensities;  Standard deviation;  Synchrotron beams;  Trigger, Cameras",Camera;  CMOS;  Proton therapy;  Scintillator;  Trigger,16-21,,,

It combines: (i) custom printed circuit boards (PCBs) with RFM69 frequency shift keying (FSK) radio frequency (RF) transceivers for wireless sensors, control nodes, and USB gateway, (ii) a Raspberry Pi 3B with custom firmware acting as either a centralized or distributed backhaul, and (iii) a custom dockerized application for the backend called Brood that serves as the director software managing message brokering via Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol using VerneMQ, database storage using InfluxDB, and data visualization using Grafana. The platform is built around the idea of a private, secure, and open technology for the built environment. Among its many applications, the platform allows occupants to investigate anomalies in energy usage, environmental quality, and thermal performance via a comprehensive dashboard with rich querying capabilities. It also includes multiple frontends to view and analyze building activity data, which can be used directly in building controls or to provide recommendations on how to increase operational efficiency or improve operating conditions. Here, we demonstrate three distinct applications of the Elemental platform, including: (1) deployment in a research lab for long-term data collection and automated analysis, (2) use as a full-home energy and environmental monitoring solution, and (3) fault and anomaly detection and diagnostics of individual building systems at the zone-level. Through these applications we demonstrate that the platform allows easy and virtually unlimited datalogging, monitoring, and analysis of real-time sensor data with low setup costs. Low-power sensor nodes placed in abundance in a building can also provide precise and immediate fault-detection, allowing for tuning equipment for more efficient operation and faster maintenance during the lifetime of the building. © 2019 by the authors.

94,Scopus,Conference Paper,"Proc. - Int. Conf. Field-Program. Log. Appl., FPL",English,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"The posit number system is proposed as a replacement of IEEE floating-point numbers. It is a floating-point system that trades exponent bits for significand bits, depending on the magnitude of the numbers. Thus, it provides more precision for numbers around 1, at the expense of lower precision for very large or very small numbers. Several works have demonstrated that this trade-off can improve the accuracy of applications. However, the variable-length exponent and significand encoding impacts the hardware cost of posit arithmetic. The objective of the present work is to enable application-level evaluations of the posit system that include performance and resource consumption. To this purpose, this article introduces an open-source hardware implementation of the posit number system, in the form of a C++ templatized library compatible with Vivado HLS. This library currently implements addition, subtraction and multiplication for custom-size posits. In addition, the posit standard also mandates the presence of the 'quire', a large accumulator able to perform exact sums of products. The proposed library includes the first open-source parameterized hardware quire. This library is shown to improve the state-of-the-art of posit implementations in terms of latency and resource consumption. Still, standard 32 bits posit adders and multipliers are found to be much larger and slower than the corresponding floating-point operators. The cost of the posit 32 quire is shown to be comparable to that of a Kulisch accumulator for 32 bits floating-point. © 2019 IEEE.","Univ Lyon, INSA Lyon, Inria, CITI, Villeurbanne, F-69621, France",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075629917&doi=10.1109%2fFPL.2019.00026&partnerID=40&md5=430c0f45c064055a1221cffb2385f83b,cited By 1,8892116,10.1109/FPL.2019.00026,,,2019,"Proceedings - 29th International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications, FPL 2019",Evaluating the hardware cost of the posit number system,"Uguen, Y. and Forget, L. and De Dinechin, F.",conference,Uguen2019106,,"Architecture;  C++ (programming language);  Computer circuits;  Digital arithmetic;  Economic and social effects;  Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA);  Numbering systems, Application level;  IEEE floating point;  Open-source hardwares;  Posit;  Resource consumption;  State of the art;  Sums of products;  Variable length, Open systems",Architecture;  FPGA;  Posit,106-113,9781728148847,"Sourdis I., Bouganis C.-S., Alvarez C., Toledo Diaz L.A., Valero P., Martorell X.",

Retrieval of animal-borne devices is often advantageous for several reasons, including data retrieval and animal welfare considerations; however, commercially available drop-off units are often prohibitively expensive and/or unreliable. Here, we present ‘OpenDropOff’, an open-source, low-cost electronic drop-off unit for remotely detaching animal-borne sensors from individuals. OpenDropOff devices function by using heat, produced by running an electrical current through resistance wire (nichrome), to melt nylon (e.g. fishing) line, detaching sensors from animals at or after a pre-determined time. OpenDropOff can be constructed using commercially available components (costing < USD $15 in total; approximately 10% or less of many commercially available drop-off units) and can be customized to fit project- and species-specific needs. Fourteen OpenDropOff devices have been field deployed on koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) (n = 11), swamp wallaby (Wallabia bicolor) (n = 1), Australian brush turkey (Alectura lathami) (n = 1) and Australian white ibis (Threskiornis molucca) (n = 1), with the only detachment failure occurring after a device was damaged during the koala’s unrelated death. OpenDropOff devices provide a wider range of researchers with a reliable, cost-effective tool for detaching animal-borne sensors. Their use could allow researchers to more efficiently allocate project resources, and their flexibility provides an opportunity to mitigate animal welfare concerns surrounding the use of animal-borne devices. © 2019 The Authors.

The separator relies on the two incoming liquids having different wettabilities to the wall of the porous capillary, with the more strongly wetting liquid leeching through the porous wall while the other liquid passes unhindered through the interior channel. To achieve complete separation of the two phases, the fluid streams at the separator outlets are monitored optically, and the back-pressure at one outlet is iteratively adjusted using a motorised needle valve until smooth time-invariant signals are recorded at both outlets. The separator may be applied to many pairings of immiscible liquids over a broad range of flow rates, automatically establishing complete separation within minutes of activation and adjusting dynamically to subsequent changes in the flow conditions.

San Vicente del Raspeig, s/n, Spain; email: jl.soler@ua.es","The analysis of seismic noise provides a reliable estimation of the soil properties, which supposes the starting point for the assessment of the seismic hazard. The horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio technique calculates the resonant frequency of the soil just by using a single three-component sensor. Array measurements require at least several vertical sensors registering simultaneously and their analysis provides an estimation of the surface waves dispersion curve. Although these methods are relatively cheaper than other geotechnical techniques, the cost of the sensors and the multi-channel data acquisition system means that small research groups cannot afford this kind of equipment. In this work, two prototypes for registering seismic noise have been developed and implemented: a three-channel acquisition system, optimized for working with three-component sensors; and a twelve-channel acquisition system, prepared for working simultaneously with twelve vertical geophones. Both prototypes are characterized by being open-hardware, open-software, easy to implement, and low-cost. The main aim is to provide a data acquisition system that can be reproduced and applied by any research group. Both developed prototypes have been tested and compared with other commercial equipment, showing their suitability to register seismic noise and to estimate the soil characteristics. © 2019 by the authors.

The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) stated that years 2015, 2016 and 2017 were the warmest since 1850. According to the preliminary data analysis of the last year, this trend is going to continue in 2018 as well. These climatic changes have accelerated the occurrence of droughts in many parts of the world including Europe and Asia. The North Western region is one such region in Sri Lanka which always affected by droughts due to its inherent dry weather condition. Although drought is considered as a normal part of the climate, its increasing negative impacts on human activities and the environment urges the application of novel technologies in drought monitoring. The 4onse project (analysis of Open, Non-conventional, Sustainable and Effective monitoring systems), funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), is a project began in this context to address the aforementioned mentioned issues by deploying 27 open technologies based Environmental Monitoring Systems (EMS) in Deduru Oya basin of Sri Lanka. These systems measure weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, pressure, rainfall, wind speed and wind direction. Thanks to the collected data, it was possible to calculate some drought indexes to evaluate the intensity of the dry periods. The Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) has been selected as the principal indicator to evaluate droughts by integrating the 4onse data together with Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) dataset. © 2019.

Signal Process., TSP",English,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"The paper describes the possibilities of data acquisition and data processing from optical sensing systems. There are some data acquisition cards and their disadvantages when used for more complex single fiber sensor systems in the paper. It is suitable to use some open source hardware because commercially available data acquisition cards are more complex and universal which means they have several different inputs/outputs and large dimensions. STEMLab 125-14 (Red Pitaya) appears to be the most suitable solution because offers 2 analog inputs and 2 analog outputs. Compare to standard data processing systems, this is supposed to be an advantage in preprocessing data using programmable logic. This can reduce the volume of transmitted data and can also speed up processing. Thus, the measurement system will be smaller and cheaper. The device contains DA converters, therefore pulses might be generated using the same clock which enables synchronization of backscatter signal. © 2019 IEEE.","Department of Telecommunication, Brno University of Technology, Brno, 61600, Czech Republic; Department of Optical Networks, CESNET A.l.e., Zikova 4, Prague, 160 00, Czech Republic",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071064320&doi=10.1109%2fTSP.2019.8769055&partnerID=40&md5=02814afdcc376156acd4d56bb83fa1b8,cited By 0,8769055,10.1109/TSP.2019.8769055,,,2019,"2019 42nd International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing, TSP 2019",High-speed data acquisition and signal processing using cost effective ARM + FPGA processors,"Dejdar, P. and Munster, P. and Horvath, T.",conference,Dejdar2019593,,"ARM processors;  Cost effectiveness;  Data acquisition;  Data handling;  Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA);  Open systems;  Pulse generators, Data acquisition cards;  Data processing systems;  High speed data acquisition;  LabViEW;  Open-source hardwares;  Optical sensing systems;  Python;  Red Pitaya, Signal processing",Data acquisition;  FPGA;  LabVIEW;  Pulse generator;  Python;  Red Pitaya,593-596,9781728118642,Herencsar N.,

The system uses a heterogeneous collection of sensors, viz., contact, flex and inertial, placed strategically on the hand to record movements and points of contact involved during gesture signing. In order to minimize user calibration, the authors propose a novel approach called as State-based gesture modelling, which requires only 7 gestures to be signed by a user to create a State-based model for all 26 alphabetic gestures in ASL for that user. A multi-stage gesture recognition algorithm, which uses the user-calibrated State-based model, is employed for gesture identification. The system was extensively tested for 2 trained and 1 amateur ASL signers for up to 150 times per gesture giving maximum efficiencies of 92% and 81% respectively, thus indicating the robustness of the system. The use of an elegant algorithm along with simple off-The-shelf sensors enabled the implementation of the entire system on an ATmega 328P micro-controller, resulting in a cost of 25 USD for a laboratory stage prototype. © 2019 IEEE.","Solarillion Foundation, India; Sri Sivasubramaniya Nadar College of Engineering, Chennai, India; SRM University, Chennai, India; Research Outreach, Solarillion Foundation, Chennai, India",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074825201&doi=10.1109%2fiThings%2fGreenCom%2fCPSCom%2fSmartData.2019.00185&partnerID=40&md5=28d04a49fe6607b1141b9ee96bfa7dd0,cited By 0,8875343,10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00185,,,2019,"Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Congress on Cybermatics: 12th IEEE International Conference on Internet of Things, 15th IEEE International Conference on Green Computing and Communications, 12th IEEE International Conference on Cyber, Physical and Social Computing and 5th IEEE International Conference on Smart Data, iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData 2019",Low-cost wearable gesture recognition system with minimal user calibration for asl,"Ahmed, S.S. and Gokul, H. and Suresh, P. and Vijayaraghavan, V.",conference,Ahmed20191080,,"Calibration;  Costs;  Embedded systems;  Green computing;  Internet of things;  Open systems;  Sensors;  Wearable sensors, American sign language;  Gesture recognition algorithm;  Gesture recognition system;  Heterogeneous collections;  Maximum Efficiency;  Open-source hardwares;  Prototype;  Wearables, Gesture recognition",Embedded Systems;  Gesture Recognition;  Open source hardware;  Prototype;  Sensors;  Wearables,1080-1087,9781728129808,,

It is not only used to implement rules but also monitor the network traffic, especially for web traffic which is considered as the common type in the Internet.

Retrieving these data and storing them can be challenging. Present options include proprietary commercial dataloggers, communication devices, and protocols with rigid software and data structures that may require ongoing expenses. While there are open-source solutions that include telemetry, such as EnviroDIY’s Mayfly, none presently generate real-time, remotely accessible workbooks (Aufdenkampe et al., 2017; EnviroDIY, 2018). The Openly Published Environmental Sensing (OPEnS) Lab developed the OPEnS Hub, a new approach to using low-power, open-source hardware and software to achieve real-time data logging from the field to the web. The Hub is an order of magnitude less expensive than commercial products, inherently modular and flexible, and aims to reduce technical barriers for users with little programming experience (DeBell, 2019). Data can be collected remotely using a host of transmission protocols to relay data from distributed in situ monitoring devices. The Hub mesh-networks with several nodes and backs up to an onboard microSD card. Telemetry options include 900 MHz Long Range Radio (LoRa) with up to 25 km range and Nordic Radio Frequency (nRF) for higher data rates (Feather, 2018). Ongoing transmissions from the Hub to the internet currently employ Ethernet with potential support for Wi-Fi and the cell network. The Hub engages a dynamic, low-latency portal to Google Sheets via the free Application Programming Interface (API), PushingBox, and an adaptable Google Apps Script. This framework was tested on 12 individual sensors nodes at remote sites in Oregon.

Arduino is an open-source hardware platform that has recently gained a wide following among students for its ease of utilization to build with it exciting interactive projects. Teaching first-year engineering classes is a challenge given the importance of these classes in providing a solid foundation in engineering education. The traditional highly demanding first-year engineering curriculum which focuses primarily on engineering thinking and problem solving with a limited content of basic skills is not inspiring to incoming students and can become overwhelming. For this reason, we will use the Arduino platform in this first-year engineering class to add more hands-on activities to the curriculum and bring the joy of achievement for students. Our goal is to add excitement to the Fundamentals of Engineering course by providing a hands-on and fun-to-learn environment designed to expose students to tools that will lead them to critical thinking, innovation, energy awareness, and problem-solving skills which will enable them to become part of a very competitive workforce in the future. Project-based courses attempt to resolve the tension between providing training in the fundamentals of engineering and problem solving by motivating and engaging students. Active learning in first year engineering courses is believed to improve retention and appeal to a diverse population of students [1].

They intend to bring a frame of reflexivity toward awareness of the politics imbued in technology as well as the often exclusionary cultures entangled therein. Further this research brings field work observations of these groups and their practices (designated as Study 1) into conversation with interviews of engineering education researchers (designated as Study 2). In that vein, this examination asks: What might an analysis of the practices and mindsets of feminist hacker and opensource science hardware groups contribute to the world of engineering education, specifically for educators interested in change-making strategies for creating a more equitable higher education environment that takes on issues of racism, sexism, heteronormativity, ableism, etc.? With a theoretical grounding in the work of Myles Horton and the Highlander Research and Education Center's theory of change, bell hooks' liberatory pedagogies, and social movement theory from a science and technology studies (STS) perspective, this paper aims to examine how current social movements in technology, specifically the organizing work of feminist hacker and tech collectives as well as those working with opensource science hardware, might inform changes to engineering practice via educational reform. Data collection for this work involves participant observation from four different meetings and discursive analysis of websites and promotional materials. The result is a multi-modal analysis which will then be brought into conversation with previous work on 32 interviews with engineering education practitioners who have identified issues in the discipline and are interested in enacting change in the higher institutional setting.

The community version of pfSense firewall will be utilized to run on the firewall. pfSense is a free and open source firewall and router, based on FreeBSD, that also features unified threat management (UTM), load balancing, and multi zone setup. pfSense implements, maintains, and polices our multi-zone topology, which is formed of a DeMilitarized Zone (DMZ), a trusted zone, and an untrusted zone. The DMZ achieves defense in depth by adding an extra layer of security beyond that of a single perimeter, separating an external network from directly referencing an internal network, and isolating a particular machine within a network. Thought the DMZ concept is not new, implementing it using stacked Single-Board Computers (SBC), offers an affordable and flexible, yet secure, network architecture specifically for startups, small businesses, an expansion office, or even home office. The selected single board computers are a combination of third generation Raspberry Pis and Rock64s. These boards provide a remarkable computational power, low energy consumption, light weight, a compact size secure solution, and resourceful community support. These boards will form the DMZ network servers and host services such as a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using Snort, a selection of honeypots for Secure Shell (SSH), web applications, packet sniffing, private web browsing capabilities via TOR (The Onion Router), LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP or Python or Perl) server, Virtual Private Network (VPN) server, and protected browsing via proxy service. The main goal of this educational project is to leverage the total holistic integration of open source hardware and software to provide an affordable and portable solution that could be promptly deployed in case of an emergency, as a part of an incident response plan (IRP), or in case it is needed for testing purposes. Implementing this project provides valuable hands-on security experience and best practices in network architecture and configuration. Additional security features, both in hardware and software, were added to the single-board computers to add additional hardened security layers. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019.","Guilford College, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078757751&partnerID=40&md5=f8ecc1b6f2f3624a8216506ed12d5b3a,cited By 0,,,,,2019,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",Implementing a demilitarized zone using holistic open source solution,"Saba, C.B.",conference,Saba2019,,,,,,,

The total construction cost for this rover is less than USD&thinsp;3000, approximately one-tenth the cost of existing platforms, and it can be built using facilities frequently available at academic institutions (machine shop, 3-D printer, open-source hardware and software). Instrumentation deployed on this rover can be customized; the rover presented in this study was equipped with a dual-frequency GPS receiver and a digital SLR camera for constructing digital elevation models using structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry. We deployed this prototype rover on the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream to map local variations in snow accumulation and surface topography. The rover conducted four autonomous missions based out of the East Greenland Ice-Core Project (EastGRIP) camp during July 2017, measuring surface elevation transects across the hazardous ice-stream shear margins. During these missions, the rover proved capable of driving over 20km on a single charge with a drawbar pull of 250N, sufficient to tow instrumentation of up to 100kg. The rover also acquired photographs that were subsequently used to construct digital elevation models of a site monitored for spatiotemporal variability in snow accumulation, demonstrating adequate stability for high-resolution imaging applications. Due to its low cost, low-power requirements, and simple modular design, mass deployments of this rover design are practicable. Operation of the rover in hazardous areas circumvents the substantial expense and risk to personnel associated with conventional, crewed deployments. Thus, this rover is an investigatory platform that enables direct exploration of polar environments considered too hazardous for conventional field expeditions. © Author(s) 2019.","Centre for Ice and Climate, Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, Juliane Maries vej 30, Copenhagen, 2100, Denmark; Geophysical Institute, University of Bergen, Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research, Bergen, Norway; Department of Earth and Space Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA  98195, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067119371&doi=10.5194%2fgi-8-149-2019&partnerID=40&md5=7bc3d8604b6a70da5fd4f839a59a8622,cited By 0,,10.5194/gi-8-149-2019,1,8,2019,"Geoscientific Instrumentation, Methods and Data Systems",A low-cost autonomous rover for polar science,"Hoffman, A.O. and Christian Steen-Larsen, H. and Christianson, K. and Hvidberg, C.",article,Hoffman2019149,,,,149-159,,,

131,Scopus,Conference Paper,"Proc. - IEEE Int. Conf. Mechatronics, ICM",English,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"The use of unmanned aquatic surface vehicles as a tool for exploring and inspecting bodies of water, such as lakes and ponds is a research area of growing interest. However, using real aquatic vehicles to test and develop software and control systems is often not feasible for many researchers, due to the limited access to testing pools and the lack of availability of low-cost, off-the-shelf surface vehicles. An alternative is to utilise software simulations, but these can fail to test important system features, such as error characteristics of real sensors, on-board processing and the effect of external disturbances on the performance of positional control systems. The contribution of the present paper is a third method that allows the robot's full software system including real world sensors to be tested without the need for pool facilities. This is achieved by mapping the physics of an omnidirectional aquatic surface robot onto an omnidirectional ground vehicle. A dynamic model of the aquatic surface vehicle is deployed within an embedded control system on the ground vehicle, meaning that for a given command signal (applied force) the motion of the ground vehicle mimics the motion that would occur if it were a surface vehicle floating on a body of water. Validation tests demonstrate that the ground vehicle's dynamic behaviour matches well with that of a specific aquatic surface vehicle that was utilised in this study. However, by changing the dynamic model within the embedded control system, the ground vehicle is able to approximate the motion of any aquatic surface vehicle. The newly constructed ground robot is now an open-source and open-hardware platform. © 2019 IEEE.","School of Electrical Electronic Engineering, University of Southampton, United Kingdom; School of Electrical Electronic Engineering, Robotics for Extreme Environments Lab (REEL), University of Manchester, Manchester, M13 9PL, United Kingdom",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067100894&doi=10.1109%2fICMECH.2019.8722901&partnerID=40&md5=da7971dc7dada7ad44fa2337f15e2031,cited By 1,8722901,10.1109/ICMECH.2019.8722901,,,2019,"Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics, ICM 2019",Embodiment of an Aquatic Surface Vehicle in an Omnidirectional Ground Robot,"Lennox, C. and Groves, K. and Hondru, V. and Arvin, F. and Gornicki, K. and Lennox, B.",conference,Lennox2019182,,"Automobile bodies;  Control systems;  Dynamic models;  Open source software;  Open systems;  Robots;  Software testing;  Surface testing, Autonomous surface vehicles;  Embedded control systems;  Error characteristics;  External disturbances;  Extreme environment;  Omnidirectional;  On-board processing;  Software simulation, Autonomous vehicles",Autonomous Robot;  Autonomous Surface Vehicle;  Extreme Environments;  Omnidirectional,182-186,9781538669594,,

For the autonomous grasping mission, the UAMs need ability to recognize the objects and grasp them. Considering the efficiency and precision, we present a novel oriented-object detection method called Rotation-SqueezeDet. This method can run on embedded-platforms in near real-time. Besides, this method can give the oriented bounding box of an object in images to enable a rotation-aware grasping. Based on this method, a UAM platform was designed and built. We have given the formulation, positioning, control, and planning of the whole UAM system. All the mechanical designs are fully provided as open-source hardware for reuse by the community. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme was validated in multiple experimental trials, highlighting its applicability of autonomous aerial rotational grasping in Global Positioning System (GPS) denied environments.

In this work, we present what is, to the best of our knowledge, the first 27g nano-UAV system able to run aboard an end-to-end, closed-loop visual pipeline for autonomous navigation based on a state-of-the-art deep-learning algorithm, built upon the open-source CrazyFlie 2.0 nano-quadrotor.

We enable onboard real-time execution of a state-of-the-art deep CNN at up to 18Hz. Field experiments demonstrate that the system's high responsiveness prevents collisions with unexpected dynamic obstacles up to a flight speed of 1.5m/s.

This prototype device employs 18 unique angular measurement positions and a variety of user-selectable LED light sources. The motivation for this project was the need to generate more parameter-rich data sets pertaining to the light-scattering properties of natural sediment suspensions, and to address the issues raised by Kitchener et al. (2017) concerning the inconsistent calibration methodologies currently employed to quantify suspended sediment concentration (SSC) by optical turbidity measurement. The mechanical design comprises re-purposed waste plastic materials and 3D-printed parts. The active light-source control and monitoring hardware and firmware executes on the open-source Arduino embedded microcontroller platform. The modular light sensors plug into any of the angular measurement positions, providing a 0–5 V nominal output signal, which is readable by the user's choice of data-acquisition system. The device will facilitate the highly detailed characterization of suspended sediment samples, providing 18 voltage output channels for analysis by the user. The precise calibration of the light sensors is by the use of neutral density (ND) filters in conjunction with light-source electrical current measurements, providing light-source intensity values as required. The empirical data provided by existing turbidity meters are acquired using incommensurate methodologies, and therefore they are not cross-comparable.

However, UWB researchers are currently limited by the small amount of feasible open source hardware that is publicly available. We developed a new open source hardware platform, Wi-PoS, for precise UWB localization based on Decawave’s DW1000 UWB transceiver with several unique features: support of both long-range sub-GHz and 2.4 GHz back-end communication between nodes, flexible interfacing with external UWB antennas, and an easy implementation of the MAC layer with the Time-Annotated Instruction Set Computer (TAISC) framework. Both hardware and software are open source and all parameters of the UWB ranging can be adjusted, calibrated, and analyzed. This paper explains the main specifications of the hardware platform, illustrates design decisions, and evaluates the performance of the board in terms of range, accuracy, and energy consumption. The accuracy of the ranging system was below 10 cm in an indoor lab environment at distances up to 5 m, and accuracy smaller than 5 cm was obtained at 50 and 75 m in an outdoor environment. A theoretical model was derived for predicting the path loss and the influence of the most important ground reflection. At the same time, the average energy consumption of the hardware was very low with only 81 mA for a tag node and 63 mA for the active anchor nodes, permitting the system to run for several days on a mobile battery pack and allowing easy and fast deployment on sites without an accessible power supply or backbone network. The UWB hardware platform demonstrated flexibility, easy installation, and low power consumption. © 2019 by the authors.

Smart converters are simple or interleaved converters. They are equipped with controllers that are able to online impedance match for the maximum power transfer. These conversion systems are particularly feasible for photovoltaic and all renewable energies systems working in continuous changing operating conditions. Smart converters represent promising solutions in recent energetic scenarios, in fact their application is deepening and widening. In this context, the availability of a hardware platform could represent a useful tool. The platform was conceived and released as an open hardware instrument for academy and industry to benefit from the improvements brought by the researchers’ community. The usage of a novel, open-source platform would allow many developers to design smart converters, focusing on algorithms instead of electronics, which could result in a better overall development ecosystem and rapid growth in the number of smart converter applications. The platform itself is proposed as a benchmark in the development and testing of different maximum power point tracking algorithms. The designed system is capable of accurate code implementations, allowing the testing of different current and voltage-controlled algorithms for different renewable energies systems. The circuit features a bi-directional radio frequency communication channel that enables real-time reading of measurements and parameters, and remote modification of both algorithm types and settings. The proposed system was developed and successfully tested in laboratory with a solar module simulator and with real photovoltaic generators. Experimental results indicate state-of-art performances as a converter, while enhanced smart features pave the way to system-level management, real-time diagnostics, and on-the-flight parameters change. Furthermore, the deployment feasibility allows different combinations and arrangements of several energy sources, converters (both single and multi-converters), and modulation strategies.

A promising technology for the safe and efficient collection of monitoring data is a compact autonomous surface vehicle (ASV), capable of autonomous navigation along a predefined trajectory based on geographic coordinates and measurements in different places and depths. In this practical paper, the development process, technical details and functional testing results of a low-cost ASV for WSP monitoring are presented. Commonly available construction materials and electronic components were used to ensure affordability and reparability. The access to online tutorials and peer-support was crucial for assembling the open-source autopilot and data logger.

High-mountain observatories are suitable places for both the con-tinual monitoring of cosmic radiation and the detection of ionizing radiation generated by lightning. Liulin Mobile Dosimetry Unit (MDU) is a silicon diode based radiation dosimeter developed by the team of Tsvetan Dachev at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, initially for the MIR space station. It is widely used as an instrument for radiation monitoring on board aircraft, on high altitude observatories as well as for example for ion fragmentation studies. The AIRDOS dosimeter is an open source device for measurement in low intensity mixed ionising radiation fields. In its aircraft version, it houses silicon PIN diode as a radiation detector, an electronics for conversion of the signal to the pulse-height spectra, Global Positioning System (GPS) module, memory card and batteries for one-month monitoring. The hardware design of AIRDOS is built on the Open Hardware modular platform MLAB, the firmware is written in Open Software platform Processing. Full documentation is freely available. Two AIRDOS de-vices have been installed at Basic Enviromental Observtory (BEO) Moussala in December 2017, complementing the radiation and environment monitoring instruments already available, including the Liulin MDU. Preliminary results of comparative measure-ments of radiation environment at BEO Moussala using the AIRDOS units and Liulin MDU will be presented. The results from BEO Moussala will be compared with data acquired on board aircraft. © 2019 Author(s).","Nuclear Physics Institute, Czech Academy of Sciences (NPI CAS), Prague, Czech Republic; Faculty of Nuclear Sciences and Technical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague, Czech Republic; Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague, Czech Republic; Institute for Nuclear Research and Nuclear Energy, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (INRNE BAS), Sofia, Bulgaria; Universal Scientific Technologies (UST), Soběslav, Czech Republic",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062837277&doi=10.1063%2f1.5091288&partnerID=40&md5=476099551262694eed56da9deb041a6c,cited By 0,130003,10.1063/1.5091288,,2075,2019,AIP Conference Proceedings,Comparative measurements of mixed radiation fields using liulin and AIRDOS dosimeters,"Kákona, M. and Štěpán, V. and Ambroaová, I. and Arsov, T. and Chroust, J. and Kákona, J. and Kalapov, I. and Krist, P. and Luaová, M. and Nikolova, N. and Peksová, D. and Ploc, O. and Sommer, M. and Šlegl, J. and Angelov, C.",conference,Kákona2019,,,,,9780735418035,"Mishonov T.M., Varonov A.M.",

In this new scenario, advanced devices are needed for real-time monitoring and control of the energy flow and power quality (PQ). Ideally, the data collected by Internet of Thing (IoT) sensors should be shared to central cloud systems for online and off-line analysis. In this paper openZmeter (oZm) is presented as an advanced low-cost and open-source hardware device for high-precision energy and power quality measurement in low-voltage power systems. An analog front end (AFE) stage is designed and developed for the acquisition, conditioning, and processing of power signals. This AFE can be stacked on available quadcore embedded ARM boards. The proposed hardware is capable of adapting voltage signals up to 800 V AC/DC and currents up to thousands of amperes using different probes. The oZm device is described as a fully autonomous open-source system for the computation and visualization of PQ events and consumed/generated energy, along with full details of its hardware implementation. It also has the ability to send data to central cloud management systems. Given the small size of the hardware design and considering that it allows measurements under a wide range of operating conditions, oZm can be used both as bulk metering or as metering/submetering device for individual appliances.

However, affordable tools are often constrained to short-term studies due to high energy consumption and limited storage. To enable long-term monitoring, energy and space efficiency must be improved on such tools. This paper describes the development and deployment of three acoustic detection algorithms that reduce the power and storage requirements of acoustic monitoring on affordable, open-source hardware. The algorithms aim to detect bat echolocation, to search for evidence of an endangered cicada species, and also to collect evidence of poaching in a protected nature reserve. The algorithms are designed to run on AudioMoth: a low-cost, open-source acoustic monitoring device, developed by the authors and widely adopted by the conservation community. Each algorithm addresses a detection task of increasing complexity, implementing extra analytical steps to account for environmental conditions such as wind, analysing samples multiple times to prevent missed events, and incorporating a hidden Markov model for sample classification in both the time and frequency domain. For each algorithm, we report on real-world deployments carried out with partner organisations and also benchmark the hidden Markov model against a convolutional neural network, a deep-learning technique commonly used for acoustics. The deployments demonstrate how acoustic detection algorithms extend the use of low-cost, open-source hardware and facilitate a new avenue for conservation researchers to perform large-scale monitoring. © 2019 by the authors.

High-resolution anatomical and functional studies of the brain require artifact-free images that are acquired with a highly sensitive radiofrequency (RF) coil. New Method: The animal holder plays an important role in mitigating image artifacts: motion artifacts are reduced by immobilizing the animal and geometric-distortion artifacts are reduced by accurately positioning the animal to improve static-field shimming. The RF coil, in turn, must provide high sensitivity over the whole brain and not physically interfere with the animal holder. To accomplish these tasks, the animal holder and RF coil should be designed in tandem. In this manuscript, animal holders and RF coils for mice, rats, and marmoset monkeys are described. Each animal holder includes components for anesthesia delivery and animal immobilization, as well as a compatible receive coil. Results/Comparison with Existing Method(s): Animal holders were capable of accurate and reproducible positioning (for the marmoset, this was in the stereotactic plane), consequently reducing geometric distortion in echo-planar images. Ear bars were designed in conjunction with receive-coil formers, thereby maximizing the sensitive region of coils, while concurrently reducing motion to less than a pixel over EPI time series.

This approach enables the targeted recording from fluorescent reporter protein expressing neurons or glial cells in brain slices and fluorescence-assisted electrophysiological recordings from subcellular structures. However, the existing tools to mix multiple light sources in one-photon microscopy are limited. Here, we present the development of several microcontroller devices that provide temporal and intensity control of light emitting diodes (LEDs) for computer controlled microscopy illumination. We interfaced one microcontroller with µManager for rapid and dynamic overlay of transmitted and fluorescent images. Moreover, on the basis of this illumination system we implemented an electronic circuit to combine two pulsed LED light sources for fast (up to 1 kHz) ratiometric calcium (Ca 2+ ) imaging. This microcontroller enabled the calibration of intracellular Ca 2+ concentration and furthermore the combination of Ca 2+ imaging with optogenetic activation. The devices are based on affordable components and open-source hardware and software. Integration into existing bright-field microscope systems will take ∼1 day. The microcontroller based LED imaging substantially advances conventional illumination methods by limiting light exposure and adding versatility and speed. © 2019 Battefeld, Popovic, van der Werf and Kole.","Department of Axonal Signaling, Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience, Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Grass Laboratory, Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods HoleMA, United States; Department of Mechatronics, Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience, Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Cell Biology, Faculty of Science, Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands; UMR 5293, Institut des Maladies Neurodégénératives, Université de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France; Molecular Cell Biology and Immunology, Amsterdam UMC, Locatie VUmc, Amsterdam, Netherlands",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061186473&doi=10.3389%2ffncel.2018.00530&partnerID=40&md5=bac094f3a3eddbcc4bcd39091e4fd912,cited By 0,530,10.3389/fncel.2018.00530,,12,2019,Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience,A versatile and open-source rapid LED switching system for one-photon imaging and photo-activation,"Battefeld, A. and Popovic, M.A. and van der Werf, D. and Kole, M.H.P.",article,Battefeld2019,,"cyan fluorescent protein, animal tissue;  Article;  electrophysiological procedures;  light absorption;  light exposure;  mouse;  nonhuman;  photoactivation;  phototoxicity;  protein expression;  transmission electron microscopy;  whole cell patch clamp",Arduino;  Calcium imaging;  High-speed imaging;  LED;  Microscopy;  Propeller;  µManager,,,,

However, open source (hardware) design implies a tremendous change in both design practices and philosophy because it is partly related to the movements of creative commons and the sharing economy. From this perspective one could think that participation is crucial in the success of open source design projects. In this paper, we analyse 9 case studies in the light of 3 hypotheses. If many studies highlight the potential of the crowd as a resource for design tasks, our study shows that for open source design communities the participation is not massive. In this study, we used an activity-based approach to build our model. As open source design processes are fairly unstructured and based on voluntary participation, it is impossible to adopt a classical task-based model. With the help of this model, we were able evaluate the overall size of the active community, the participation rate with regards to the activities.

Several researchers worked on how to characterize OSH. Bonvoisin and Mies (Procedia CIRP 78:388–393, 2018) defined the “open-o-meter”, i.e. a series of criteria to measure the openness of an OSH project. These criteria fall into two categories: product openness and process openness. The open-o-meter gives clear guidelines on measuring product openness by verifying access to specific types of documents, however the criteria to measure process openness are relatively implicit. In this paper, we propose to measure an OSH project’s process openness by identifying different types of collaboration tools in that project. We will evaluate 226 OSH projects’ process openness by analysing their usage of collaboration tools, for example social media, wiki, GitHub etc. This empirical study showed that the usage of collaboration tools in OSH projects decreases as the score of open-o-meter decreases, which implies that the open-o-meter measures correctly an OSH project’s process openness.

It involves the use of cheap, widely-available, open-source hardware with a total cost of less than $150, coupled with a simple, though innovative, processing method. As well as the cost of the equipment the new system also allows data to be acquired more quickly (8 minutes vs. 30 minutes for a conventional system).

In addition, parametric modeling is encouraged in order to facilitate customization for other experiments. Parametric design using a solid modeling programming language allows customization and provides a source file for the design. OpenSCAD is the most widely used scripting tool for parametric modeling of open source labware. However, OpenSCAD lacks the ability to export to standard parametric formats; thus, the parametric dimensional information of the model is lost. This is an important deficiency because it is key to share the design in the most accessible formats with no information loss. In this work we analyze OpenSCAD and compare it with FreeCAD Python scripts. We have created a parametric open source hardware design to compare these tools. Our findings show that although Python for FreeCAD is more arduous to learn, its advantages counterbalance the initial difficulties. The main benefits are being able to export to standard parametric models; using Python language with its libraries; and the ability to use and integrate the models in its graphical interface. Thus, making it more appropriate to design open source hardware for scientific equipment. © 2019 Machado et al.

First, a virtual control with nonlinear sliding manifolds is designed to achieve position-tracking capability, as well as to guarantee the fast convergence of the UAV to a desired position. Furthermore, an ultimate control is developed for the desired attitude-tracking performance. Various uncertainties, including torque due to the discordance between the centre of mass and rotation and wind disturbances are considered. The Lyapunov stability theorem is then applied step-by-step to prove the asymptotically stable and finite-time convergence in position and attitude controllers. Second, the proposed controller is implemented in an open-source hardware platform for a quadrotor UAV. Both numerical and experimental results are compared to validate the tracking performance for attitude and position control, as well as robustness under disturbances. © 2013 IEEE.","School of Mechanical, Aerospace and Nuclear Engineering, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan, 44919, South Korea; Department of Aerospace Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology at Kanpur, Kanpur, 208016, India",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078054394&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2019.2956190&partnerID=40&md5=238a2869ec299c32d4441fc073dee0cd,cited By 0,8915689,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2956190,,7,2019,IEEE Access,Finite-Time Control of Multirotor UAVs under Disturbances,"Chung, W. and Giri, D.K. and Son, H.",article,Chung2019173549,,"Aircraft detection;  Antennas;  Attitude control;  Controllers;  Open systems;  Sliding mode control;  Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), Asymptotically stable;  External disturbances;  Finite-time control;  Finite-time convergence;  Lyapunov stability theorem;  Open-source hardwares;  Steady-state response;  Tracking performance, Aircraft control",Finite-time control;  sliding-mode control (SMC);  unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV),173549-173558,,,

Congr.,English,,,CRC Press/Balkema,,"Recent developments in sensing and monitoring technology allow the application of various sensors and sensor networks for tunnel maintenance. Most maintenance monitoring techniques focus on measuring physical parameters of and within the tunnel structure it-self, with less emphasis placed on the ground conditions surrounding the tunnel structure. Soft soil, weak soil or grouted soil zones are particularly susceptible to long-term changes in ground condition and thus, extensive monitoring is essential to ensure long term tunnel stability and accurate numerical analysis. This study proposes a ground monitoring sensor system for tunnel maintenance using geophysical techniques. The proposed system uses seismic wave velocity and electrical resistivity techniques to estimate the changes in the geomechanical properties of the ground. A low cost prototype sensor was created using open source hardware and software and preliminary tests were conducted on an open area test site. The results show that the system can adequately perform seismic and electrical resistivity tests for tunnel maintenance purposes. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, London.","Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068423334&doi=10.1201%2f9780429424441-250&partnerID=40&md5=5f97a970aab36b8b9661c7173a2c954f,cited By 0,,10.1201/9780429424441-250,,,2019,"Tunnels and Underground Cities: Engineering and Innovation meet Archaeology, Architecture and Art- Proceedings of the WTC 2019 ITA-AITES World Tunnel Congress",Development of a ground monitoring sensor system for tunnel maintenance using geophysical techniques,"Kim, J.W. and Cho, G.C.",conference,Kim20192366,,"Electric conductivity;  Maintenance;  Office buildings;  Open source software;  Open systems;  Seismology;  Sensor networks;  Software testing;  Soil testing;  Soils;  Structural geology;  Wave propagation, Electrical resistivity tests;  Geomechanical properties;  Geophysical techniques;  Maintenance monitoring;  Monitoring technologies;  Open area test sites;  Open-source hardwares;  Seismic wave velocity, Monitoring",,2366-2372,9781138388659,"Peila D., Viggiani G., Viggiani G., Celestino T.",

In this paper we investigate a case study about the migration of an old chip card based access control system to this new way of authorizing people, based on NFC tags. To this aim, we propose a Model Driven approach that supports (semi) automatic code generation for enabling the communication between an IoT infrastructure and platforms for Facility Access Management. Specifically, the approach combines the benefits of NFC and Tinkerforge (i.e., an open source hardware platform) technologies with model driven techniques. As a consequence, it allows the reduction of the implementation efforts, by also providing snippets as exemplary code usage, while making the whole development process less error-prone and time consuming.

In parallel, open source technology has gained increasing attention from last years, especially due to the widespread presence of the open source hardware Arduino microcontroller. Focusing on industrial advanced frameworks, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are required to exchange data with new smart devices, sensors and/or actuators. Arduino boards are commonly used as development platforms for such smart devices. Therefore, communication solutions must be designed towards the convergence of open source hardware and widely used traditional SCADA-devoted software.

Preparative liquid chromatography was implemented with a reverse phase gradient from MeOH to toluene. The system allows three solvents and fractions changes by using quaternary valves connected to an Arduino microcontroller, programmed on the basis of the absorbance signal measured and its first derivative. Additionally, the method was applied to crude oils (Venezuelan National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 8505 and from a marine reservoir). V and Ni were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and the V-porphyrin profile was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-ICP-MS. The concentrations of the metals grow in the last eluting toluene fractions, associated with asphaltenes. On the other hand, V-porphyrins in the first eluting MeOH fractions showed profiles of labile compounds, with a higher percentage in the Brazilian crude oil (4.9 mg L-1, corresponding to 18% of total V), in comparison to the one from the biodegraded NIST 8505 (59 mg L-1, corresponding to 7% of total V).

In this view, this paper targets the algorithmic development and generic HDL generators (PACoGen) for basic posit arithmetic. The proposed open source PACoGen currently includes the adder/subtractor, multiplier, and division arithmetic. The PACoGen can provide the Verilog HDL code respective posit arithmetic for any given posit word width (N) and exponent size (ES), as defined under the posit number system. Further, pipelined architectures of 32-bit posit with 6-bit exponent size are also proposed and discussed for addition/subtraction, multiplication, and division arithmetic. The proposed posit arithmetic architectures are demonstrated on the Virtex-7 (xc7vx330t-3ffg1157) FPGA device as well as Nangate 15 nm ASIC platform. The PACoGen would open a gateway for further posit arithmetic hardware exploration and evaluation. © 2013 IEEE.","Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068239068&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2019.2920936&partnerID=40&md5=bade0fb49b1945e6376c1e047555c0ef,cited By 1,8731915,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2920936,,7,2019,IEEE Access,PACoGen: A Hardware Posit Arithmetic Core Generator,"Jaiswal, M.K. and So, H.K.-H.",article,Jaiswal201974586,,"Adders;  Application specific integrated circuits;  Digital arithmetic;  Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA);  Numbering systems;  Open systems;  Pipeline processing systems;  Pipelines, division;  Hardware solutions;  multiplier;  Number system;  Open-source hardwares;  Pipelined architecture;  Run-time variations;  Subtractor, Computer architecture",Adder;  ASIC;  digital arithmetic;  division;  floating point arithmetic;  FPGA;  multiplier;  posit arithmetic;  subtractor;  universal number system,74586-74601,,,

The EyeTrackers and Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are suitable systems for those people but their main drawback is their cost. More affordable devices are capable of detecting voluntary blinks and translating them into a binary signal that allows the selection, for example, of an ideogram on a communication board. We tested four different systems based on infrared, bioelectrical signals (Electro-Oculography (EOG) and Electro-Encephalography (EEG)), and video processing. The experiments were performed by people with/without disabilities and analyzed the systems' performances, usability, and method of voluntary blinking (long blinks or sequence of two short blinks). The best accuracy (99.3%) was obtained using Infrared-Oculography (IR-OG) and the worst with the EEG headset (85.9%) and there was a statistical influence of the technology on accuracy. Regarding the method of voluntary blinking, the use of long or double blinks had no statistical influence on accuracy, excluding EOG, and the time taken to perform double blinks was shorter, resulting in a potentially much faster interface. People with disabilities obtained similar values but with greater variability. The preferred technology and blinking methods were Video-Oculography (VOG) and long blinks, respectively. The several Open-Source Hardware (OSHW) devices have been developed and a new algorithm for detecting voluntary blinks has also been proposed, which outperforms most of the published papers in the reviewed literature. © 2013 IEEE.","Department of Electronic Technology, E.T.S.

199,Scopus,Article,Hum Comput Interact,English,,07370024,Taylor and Francis Inc.,,"Open Design is an emerging area of research that seeks to connect and extend the culture of making, social innovation, open-source software, and open-source hardware. A cornerstone for Open Design is to broaden participation in technology innovation by allowing people to use and contribute to publicly shared resources. Makerspaces are important access points to share and contribute to these resources. However, prior to entering the physical door of a makerspace, makerspaces’ social media presence serve as the ‘front door’ for Open Design activities. In this paper, we examine different ‘front doors’ of Open Design, asking: What are the characteristics that produce makerspaces’ social media presences, and how do these representations shape potential access to Open Design activities? We manually collected and qualitatively analyzed 500 public posts on the Facebook sites of five makerspaces in Copenhagen, Denmark. By choosing the same geographical area, we were able to explore the characteristics of makerspaces’ social media presences for the same potential population of Open Design participants. Our analysis identifies three main characteristics of makerspaces’ social media presence, which together shape access to Open Design activities, namely reach, transparency, and discourse. The display of these characteristics produce openness and availability in unique ways, and is constitutive for how Open Design activities are produced online. In this paper, we do not argue for or against specific social media representations. Instead, we argue that the specificities and differences between makerspaces’ social media presences in the same geographical region have the strength of producing different identities across spaces, allowing for a broader definition and potential participation in Open Design. © 2019, Copyright © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","University of Copenhagen, Denmark; University of Washington, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063934039&doi=10.1080%2f07370024.2019.1566000&partnerID=40&md5=f5c3fa997b6d53f2a5eefe820fa873d5,cited By 1,,10.1080/07370024.2019.1566000,5-6,34,2019,Human-Computer Interaction,Makerspaces on Social Media: Shaping Access to Open Design,"Menendez-Blanco, M. and Bjørn, P.",article,Menendez-Blanco2019470,HCINE,"Open source software;  Open systems;  Social networking (online), Access points;  Design activity;  Geographical area;  Open-source hardwares;  Potential population;  Shared resources;  Social innovations;  Technology innovation, Availability",,470-505,,,

Therefore, establishing and implementing research projects pursuing objectives as the design of agricultural production procedures which allow more productivity, cleanness, and efficient processes are welcome. We present a wireless sensor network proposal oriented to deal with the lack of monitoring in some agronomic/climatic variables. The prototype is intended to measure variables such as temperature and soil/air moisture. Also measured are soil pH and the most relevant greenhouse gases, i.e., carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. We focused our work in measuring the greenhouse gases to analyze the values in parts per million, seeking to establish a reference point to potentially calculate the carbon footprint associated to the sugarcane cultivation. The closed-chamber technique was used for the measurements and the initial results showed that the gases concentrations were higher outside the chamber: 376Â ppm of CO2, 1.31Â ppm of CH4, and 0.504Â ppm of N2O (outside) compared with the values inside them: 291Â ppm of CO2, 1.01Â ppm of CH4, and 0.163Â ppm of N2O (inside) as average values. Nevertheless, bias was observed during the measurements due to the high current demand the gas sensors needed.

Thus, these platforms grow more complex, with new features continually introducing the possibility of new bugs. Although the semiconductor industry employs a combination of different verification techniques to ensure the security of System-on-Chip (SoC) designs, a growing number of increasingly sophisticated attacks are starting to leverage cross-layer bugs. These attacks leverage subtle interactions between hardware and software, as recently demonstrated through a series of real-world exploits that affected all major hardware vendors. In this paper, we take a deep dive into microarchitectural security from a hardware designer's perspective by reviewing state-of-the-art approaches used to detect hardware vulnerabilities at design time. We show that a protection gap currently exists, leaving chip designs vulnerable to software-based attacks that can exploit these hardware vulnerabilities. Inspired by real-world vulnerabilities and insights from our industry collaborator (a leading chip manufacturer), we construct the first representative testbed of real-world software-exploitable RTL bugs based on RISC-V SoCs. Patching these bugs may not always be possible and can potentially result in a product recall. Based on our testbed, we conduct two extensive case studies to analyze the effectiveness of state-of-the-art security verification approaches and identify specific classes of vulnerabilities, which we call HardFails, which these approaches fail to detect. Through our work, we focus the spotlight on specific limitations of these approaches to propel future research in these directions. We envision our RISC-V testbed of RTL bugs providing a rich exploratory ground for future research in hardware security verification and contributing to the open-source hardware landscape. © 2019 by The USENIX Association.

In most of the low-budget mammalian cell study laboratories, highly skilled laboratory personnel should determine microscopic changes in microplate well media by taking the microplate outside the incubator and by imaging each well medium under a microscope, with the risk of contamination and reliability degrading. An alternative solution is to use an in-incubator operated live-cell imaging device, which, however, cannot be afforded by low-cost laboratories. In this paper, we present the design, realization, and test stages of a microplate compatible inverted bright-field microscope system that can be used in incubators. The developed system enables real-time and long-term in-incubator imaging of any user-selectable microplate type. The device can capture bright-field microscopic images by using a low-cost CMOS image sensor, an inverted varifocal CCTV lens and an array of light emitting diodes. In addition, by developed two-axial movement stage and image augmenting algorithms, the whole area of a user selectable well (e.g. area of a 6.5 mm diameter well in a 96-well plate) can be automatically imaged without using any other third party software.

Concerning the first, while the processing power of present-day computers enables their use in real-time, many restrictions arising from this sample-based design persist; the huge on disk space requirements and the stiffness of musical articulations being the most prominent. On the other side of the spectrum, pure synthesis approaches, while offering greater flexibility, fail to capture and reproduce certain nuances central to the verisimilitude of the generated sound, offering a dry, synthetic output, at a high computational cost. We propose a method where ensembles of lightweight neural networks working in parallel are learned, from crafted frequency-domain features of an instrument sound spectra, an arbitrary instrument’s voice and articulations realistically and efficiently. We find that our method, while retaining perceptual sound quality on par with sampled approaches, exhibits 1/10 of latency times of industry standard real-time synthesis algorithms, and 1/100 of the disk space requirements of industry standard sample-based digital musical instruments. This method can, therefore, serve as a basis for more efficient implementations in dedicated devices, such as keyboards and electronic drumkits and in general purpose platforms, like desktops and tablets or open-source hardware like Arduino and Raspberry Pi. From a conceptual point of view, this work highlights the advantages of a closer integration of machine learning with other subjects, especially in the endeavor of new product development. Exploiting the synergy between neural networks, digital signal processing techniques and physical modelling, we illustrate the proposed method via the implementation of two virtual instruments: a conventional grand piano and a hibrid stringed instrument. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Universidade Federal Fluminense, Niterói, RJ, Brazil",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072864978&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-30490-4_30&partnerID=40&md5=93dec1d2d83e3acbf30cd0561022464d,cited By 0,,10.1007/978-3-030-30490-4_30,,11730 LNCS,2019,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),Neuro-Spectral Audio Synthesis: Exploiting Characteristics of the Discrete Fourier Transform in the Real-Time Simulation of Musical Instruments Using Parallel Neural Networks,"Tarjano, C. and Pereira, V.",article,Tarjano2019362,,"Digital signal processing;  Discrete Fourier transforms;  Electronic musical instruments;  Frequency domain analysis;  Machine learning;  Neural networks;  Open systems;  Product development, Acoustic model;  Digital signal processing techniques;  Efficient implementation;  New product development;  Open-source hardwares;  Parallel neural networks;  Real time simulations;  Real-time audio, Audio acoustics",Acoustic modeling;  Digital musical instruments;  Neural networks;  Real-time audio synthesis,362-375,9783030304898,"Tetko I.V., Karpov P., Theis F., Kurkova V.",

Here the author describes the use of open-source software and open hardware design to build a deconvolution microscope at low cost, using readily available software and hardware. The advantage of this method is its cost-effectiveness and ability to construct a microscope system using commercially available optical components and open-source software.

We use the Arduino Due as opensource hardware. The proposed high speed monitoring system has four features. First, it does not affect the operation of the user application running on a micro-controller. The proposed system performs realtime monitoring using an algorithm that minimizes the computational load. Second, data channels can have different data types and update periods. Consequently, flexible data monitoring is possible. Third, the proposed system uses MATLAB/Simulink for monitoring. As a result, users can utilize all the powerful functions supported by MATLAB to process the monitored data. Finally, the algorithm of the proposed high speed monitoring system can be applied to any micro-controller with serial communication peripheral. Through experiments, we verify the performance of the developed monitoring system. It is shown that the data loss does not happen through the basic experiment. Through realtime monitoring experiment for the sensorless drive system of the BLDC motor, it is illustrated that the proposed system has its strength in high speed monitoring of data changing very fast such as current or back EMF signals. © ICROS 2019.","Department of Electrical Engineering, Inha University, South Korea",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078335924&doi=10.5302%2fJ.ICROS.2019.19.0206&partnerID=40&md5=354de7e081b5bb1baaf83f1ae7a302d1,cited By 0,,10.5302/J.ICROS.2019.19.0206,12,25,2019,"Journal of Institute of Control, Robotics and Systems",Development of a high speed monitoring system using opensource hardware and MATLAB,"Jo, B. and Lee, Y.-S.",article,Jo20191057,,"Brushless DC motors;  Data acquisition;  Digital storage;  Microcontrollers;  Speed, Computational loads;  Data monitoring;  Monitoring system;  Open-source hardwares;  Powerful functions;  Real time monitoring;  Sensorless drive systems;  Serial communications, Monitoring",Data monitoring;  High speed monitoring system;  USB data acquisition,1057-1064,,,

It supports a wide variety of data formats, algorithms, and rendering techniques for both polygonal and volumetric data. In particular, VTK's volume rendering module has long provided a comprehensive set of features such as plane clipping, color and opacity transfer functions, lighting, and other controls needed for visualization. However, due to VTK's legacy OpenGL backend and its reliance on a deprecated API, the system did not take advantage of the latest improvements in graphics hardware or the flexibility of a programmable pipeline. Additionally, this dependence on an antiquated pipeline posed restrictions when running on emerging computing platforms, thereby limiting its overall applicability. In response to these shortcomings, the VTK community developed a new and improved volume rendering module, which not only provides a modern graphics processing unit-based implementation, but also augments its capabilities with new features such as fast volume clipping, gradient-magnitude-based opacity modulation, render to texture, and hardware-based volume picking. © 2018 IEEE.","Kitware, Inc., Clifton Park, NY, United States; Smart Reporting GmbH, Munich, Germany",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062857916&doi=10.1109%2fMCG.2018.2880818&partnerID=40&md5=088e8befc2adbb900bdc2ab303328c30,cited By 1,8663650,10.1109/MCG.2018.2880818,1,39,2019,IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications,"Cross-Platform Ubiquitous Volume Rendering Using Programmable Shaders in VTK for Scientific and Medical Visualization: Open Source, Hardware Accelerated Ray Casting","Chaudhary, A. and Jhaveri, S.J. and Sanchez, A. and Avila, L.S. and Martin, K.M. and Vacanti, A. and Hanwell, M.D. and Schroeder, W.",article,Chaudhary201926,ICGAD,"Application programming interfaces (API);  Data handling;  Graphics processing unit;  Opacity;  Open systems;  Pipelines;  Program processors;  Textures;  Visualization;  Volume rendering;  Volumetric analysis, Gradient magnitude;  Graphics processing;  Hardware-accelerated;  Medical data visualization;  Medical visualization;  Opacity transfer functions;  Programmable shaders;  Visualization toolkits, Data visualization, algorithm;  computer assisted diagnosis;  computer graphics;  diagnostic imaging;  human;  image processing;  software;  tooth;  trunk, Algorithms;  Computer Graphics;  Diagnostic Imaging;  Humans;  Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;  Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;  Software;  Tooth;  Torso",,26-43,,,

The subsystem A is used to implement automatic fertigation and collect data from subsystem B, which will be uploaded to cloud server database (subsystem C). The subsystem B is used to monitor the environmental parameters in the greenhouse such as air temperature/humidity, soil temperature/humidity etc. The subsystem C is used for storage of greenhouse environment data and communication between subsystem B and subsystem D. The subsystem D is used for data visualization including real-Time display, storage and analysis of greenhouse environmental data, and remote control of fertigation system including the EC/pH control of the fertigation solution, irrigation scheduling, and fertigation settings. A proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control algorithm is used for the fertigation process of the subsystem A.

First, the integrated system design was adopted based on the Linux architecture, and the power-efficient opensource hardware was taken as the mini Linux PCs on the bridge site. Next, several sensor subsystems were integrated physically via the Ethernet, while nine core software modules were developed based on opensource software and integrated into a logical whole. The stability of the system was improved through dual PC redundancy and intelligent fault diagnosis. The data collected by sensors were analyzed in real time and only the valid data and alarms were transmitted to the remote monitoring center. In addition, the remote transmission and active control were completed, with the aid of 3G/4G router, VPN and reverse SSH tunneling. In this way, the author developed an easy-to-maintain and cost-efficient SHM system. Finally, the effectiveness of the system was verified through the application in a bridge on an expressway in Yunnan Province, China. The results fully demonstrate the robustness, accuracy and cost effectiveness of the proposed system.

The increasing number of vehicles flowing into the city drain the existing scarce parking resources, and the increase in time spent looking for a parking spot leads to more congestions, parasitic traffic, whilst augmenting fuel consumption and air pollution. In this paper we present an integrated flexible solution developed to help address this issue, using open hardware and software components to develop a low-cost smart parking system suitable for contemporary metropolitan cities.

This provides a means for selecting an optimal OPAP. The design of the Innovation toolkit has been approached in four different steps: modelling of OPAP Products; modelling of evaluation measures and evaluation indices with end-user preferences; identification of the optimal module options for every configuration and Configuration optimisation.

Common approaches for measuring liquid intake in real time include computer-tethered lickometers or video-based systems. Additionally, liquids can be measured or weighed to determine the amount consumed without real-time sensing. Here, we built a photobeam-based sipper device that has the following advantages over traditional methods: (1) it is battery powered and fits in vivarium caging to allow home-cage measurements; (2) it quantifies the intake of two different liquids simultaneously for preference studies; (3) it is low cost and easily constructed, enabling high-throughput experiments; and (4) it is open source so that others can modify it to fit their experimental needs. We validated the performance of this device in three experiments. First, we calibrated our device using time-lapse video-based measurements of liquid intake and correlated sipper interactions with liquid intake. Second, we used the sipper device to measure preference for water versus chocolate milk, demonstrating its utility for two-bottle choice tasks. Third, we integrated the device with fiber photometry, establishing its utility for measuring neural activity in studies of ingestive behavior. This device requires no special equipment or caging, and is small, battery powered, and wireless, allowing it to be placed directly in rodent home cages. The total cost of fabrication is less than $100, and all design files and code are open source. Together, these factors greatly increase scalability and utility for a variety of behavioral neuroscience applications. © 2019 Godynyuk et al.","Department of Anesthesiology, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO  63108, United States; Department of Psychiatry, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO  63108, United States; Departments of Neuroscience and Biomedical Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO  63108, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073125045&doi=10.1523%2fENEURO.0292-19.2019&partnerID=40&md5=58c7e3fc559d53995aa31a06075b9ab1,cited By 0,ENEURO.0292-19.2019,10.1523/ENEURO.0292-19.2019,5,6,2019,eNeuro,"An open-source, automated home-cage sipper device for monitoring liquid ingestive behavior in rodents","Godynyuk, E. and Bluitt, M.N. and Tooley, J.R. and Kravitz, A.V. and Creed, M.C.",article,Godynyuk2019,,"water;  water, adult;  Article;  behavior assessment;  chocolate milk;  cost benefit analysis;  female;  food intake;  home-cage activity test;  liquid;  male;  metabolism;  mouse;  nerve cell;  neuroscience;  nonhuman;  photometry;  priority journal;  rodent;  time lapse imaging;  animal;  animal housing;  C57BL mouse;  devices;  drinking behavior;  equipment design;  milk;  physiology;  procedures;  rodent, Animals;  Drinking Behavior;  Equipment Design;  Female;  Housing, Animal;  Male;  Mice;  Mice, Inbred C57BL;  Milk;  Rodentia;  Water",Arduino;  Open source hardware;  Two-bottle choice,,,,

The system comprises a Raspberry Pi camera mounted on an aluminium extrusion frame with 3D-printed joints controlled by an Arduino microcontroller running open-source Repetier Host Firmware. The camera position is controlled by simple G-code scripts supplied from a Raspberry Pi singleboard computer and allow customized time-lapse imaging of microdevices over a large imaging area.

The proposed platform allows to test a heat dissipation solution under realistic conditions, including fast spatial and temporal power gradients as well as hot spots, while collecting a temperature map of the active silicon layer.

231,Scopus,Article,Acta Polytech. Hung.,English,,17858860,Budapest Tech Polytechnical Institution,,"Nowadays, energy consumption and especially energy saving, are topics of great importance. Recent news regarding global warming has increased the need to save energy. In Finland, one of the major sources of energy consumption is housing. Furthermore, the heating of residential buildings accounts for up to 68% of housing energy consumption. Therefore, it is not surprising that apartment energy consumption and ways to save energy in housing are a popular research topic in Finland. In this paper, two different research areas are introduced: First, a literature survey is presented on the research subjects of energy saving in the area of real estate and housing. The goal is to gain overall knowledge of the current state of energy saving research. The overall conclusion is that knowledge of energy consumption improves efforts toward energy saving. Second, rapid prototyping with off-the-shelf devices and open source software are described. These devices are cheap to install, and a wide range of sensors are available. Consequently, it is important to deal with these topics together. The former studies provide knowledge about the usage of open hardware, open software, and open architectures with the development of prototype systems for gathering data. The literature survey gives us new information on the specialties of energy consumption measuring, offering a new area for modeling and developing prototype systems. These experiences will be taken forward and utilized in energy saving and environmentally sustainable solutions, such as Green Computing. © 2019, Budapest Tech Polytechnical Institution.

232,Scopus,Article,Hum Comput Interact,English,,07370024,Taylor and Francis Inc.,,"This study reports on the results of a systematic literature review on ‘open design’ in academic fields including and beyond design and HCI. The review investigates how studies are framed as open design and open-source design (including ‘open hardware’): how researchers contribute to conceptual theorizing about open design or study its practical operationalization, in do-it-yourself ‘making,’ manufacturing and practices in-between these domains. Most of the papers reviewed were empirical studies from diverse fields. Open design was analyzed not only as contributions and solutions, but also as open-to-participate processes, openly shared processes, and open, closed, and modular (open and closed) outcomes. Various research fields presented an open design framing as an alternative to the status quo: new ways to do business and/or to foster socio-environmental sustainability. On the manufacturing side, open design was sought especially to accelerate innovation cycles; on the making side, it was espoused to foster democratization. However, the studies reviewed indicated that companies do not appear to develop much beyond business-as-usual. From the research perspective, the conceptual potential of open design to promote sustainability saw little practical exploration. Additionally, issues around open design community governance and ownership, safety and reliability of open outcomes require further investigation. © 2019, Copyright © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","University of Limerick, Ireland; Aalto University, Finland",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062349521&doi=10.1080%2f07370024.2019.1574225&partnerID=40&md5=99ab0a50f72f0a3e6ebd9bbddaedff52,cited By 2,,10.1080/07370024.2019.1574225,,,2019,Human-Computer Interaction,Framing Open Design through Theoretical Concepts and Practical Applications: A Systematic Literature Review,"Bakırlıoğlu, Y. and Kohtala, C.",article,Bakırlıoğlu2019,HCINE,"Manufacture;  Open systems, Academic fields;  Business-as-usual;  Design community;  Empirical studies;  Environmental sustainability;  Innovation cycles;  Research fields;  Systematic literature review, Sustainable development",,,,,

To assess the potential of autonomous low-cost UAVs for the mapping and monitoring of alpine glaciers, we conducted multiple aerial surveys on the Kanderfirn in the Swiss Alps in 2017 and 2018 using open hardware and software of the Paparazzi UAV project. The open-source photogrammetry software OpenDroneMap was tested for the generation of high-resolution orthophotos and digital surface models (DSMs) from aerial imagery and cross-checked with the well-established proprietary software Pix4D. Accurately measured ground control points served for the determination of the geometric accuracy of the orthophotos and DSMs. A horizontal (xy) accuracy of 0.7-1.2 m and a vertical (z) accuracy of 0.7-2.1 m was achieved for OpenDroneMap, compared to a xy-accuracy of 0.3-0.5 m and a z-accuracy of 0.4-0.5 m obtained for Pix4D. Based on the analysis and comparison of different orthophotos and DSMs, surface elevation, roughness and brightness changes from 3 June to 29 September 2018 were quantified. While the brightness of the glacier surface decreased linearly over the ablation season, the surface roughness increased. The mean DSM-based elevation change across the glacier tongue was 8 m, overestimating the measured melting and surface lowering at the installed ablation stakes by about 1.5 m. The presented results highlight that self-built fixed-wing UAVs in tandem with open-source photogrammetry software are an affordable alternative to commercial remote-sensing platforms and proprietary software. The applied low-cost approach also provides great potential for other regions and geoscientific disciplines. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Further development in this area is coupling open source electronics with 3-D printable mechanical components to make fully functional distributedly-manufactured mechatronic tools for science. One research area where such low-cost technology is needed is to characterize thin film anti-reflective coatings and transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) for the glass, mirror and solar photovoltaic industry whose transmission properties are angle dependent. To meet this research need a low-cost 3-D printable open source dual axis gimbal system is presented in this study. An Arduino based microcontroller is used to move the sample holder to the user specified angle where two stepper motors control the motion providing two degrees of freedom. The sample holder is made in such a way that samples can easily be mounted on it by two movable latches. The system was validated and characterized for: i) unidirectional accuracy, ii) repeatability, iii) backlash, iv) speed resolution and v) microstep size. Finally, the mechatronic system is tested for the intended application using a halogen light source and a spectrometer to measure transmission through glass TCO samples through a hemisphere. The system performed as expected has a unidirectional accuracy of 2.827° repeatability of 1.585° backlash error of 1.237° maximum speed of 35.156° and a verifiable microstep size of 0.33°. Despite the highest mean squared errors, the open source gimbal system performed adequately while measuring transmission of radiation through glass with TCO coatings. This open source system also represents a 96% cost in savings as compared to the least expensive commercial variant. The high mean squared errors are offset by the cost of the system coupled with its open source nature that promotes further collaboration and hence, development. © 2018","Department of Materials Science & Engineering, Michigan Technological University, United States; Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Michigan Technological University, United States; Department of Mechanical Engineering–Engineering Mechanics, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, United States; Department of Electronics and Nanoengineering, School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto University, Espoo, FI-02150, Finland",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050803399&doi=10.1016%2fj.mechatronics.2018.07.005&partnerID=40&md5=5dffb5214b2852bf7a056cb33b9796a8,cited By 2,,10.1016/j.mechatronics.2018.07.005,,56,2018,Mechatronics,3-D printable open source dual axis gimbal system for optoelectronic measurements,"Bihari, N. and Dash, S.P. and Dhankani, K.C. and Pearce, J.M.",article,Bihari2018175,MECHE,"Antireflection coatings;  Costs;  Degrees of freedom (mechanics);  Errors;  Glass;  Glass industry;  Hardware;  Light sources;  Mean square error;  Optoelectronic devices;  Reflective coatings;  Solar power generation;  Stepping motors;  Transparent conducting oxides, 3-D printing;  FOSH;  Gimbal system;  Open-source hardwares;  Rotator;  Transmittance, Open systems",3-D printing;  FOSH;  Gimbal system;  Open source hardware;  Optoelectronics;  Rotator;  Transmittance,175-187,,,

The node is called SEnviro (node) and features different improvements such as: the possibility of remote updates using Over-the-Air (OTA) updates; autonomy, using 3G connectivity, a solar panel, and applied energy strategies to prolong its life; and replicability, because it is made up of open hardware and other elements such as 3D-printed pieces. The node is validated in the field of smart agriculture, with the aim of monitoring different meteorological phenomena, which will be used as input to disease detection models to detect possible diseases within vineyards. © 2018 by the authors.

While simulation tools provide a simple and inexpensive method to gain an understanding of algorithms and protocols in MANET research, its reliability and accuracy in representing real systems and contexts are critically limited. Thus, this paper unveils the ToMRobot, created with low budget using ordinary remote control (RC) car coupled with a few low cost electronic components, to serve as a fully functional MANET testbed. Provided in this paper are practical knowhow to model and produce ToMRobot from scratch specifically targeted to facilitate less technical savvy MANET researchers. Despite being really economical, significantly inexpensive to create, highly customizable with flexible option that allows researchers to upgrade by utilizing components such as Arduino and Cubieboard2 from technologies that can be sourced from open hardware, ToMRobot still maintains all aspects of MANET rudimentary structures. It is hoped that the guidelines contained within this paper will help MANET researchers to build robots that can be used in their future MANET testbeds, which will in turn ultimately increase the number of MANET researchers who choose testbeds as their evaluation tool. © 2018 IEEE.","Faculty of Computing, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Skudai, Johor, 81310, Malaysia; Department of CSE IT, JayPee University of IT, Waknaghat, Solan, Himachal Pradesh  17334, India; Faculty of Art, Computing Creative Industry, Universiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris, Tanjung Malim, Perak, 35900, Malaysia; School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Gelugor, Pulau Pinang, 11800, Malaysia",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069494568&doi=10.1109%2fPDGC.2018.8745838&partnerID=40&md5=52419c1add62032c9fe352a5ea649482,cited By 0,8745838,10.1109/PDGC.2018.8745838,,,2018,"PDGC 2018 - 2018 5th International Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Grid Computing",ToMRobot: A low-cost robot for MANET testbed,"Muchtar, F. and Singh, P.K. and Kumar, Y. and Ariffin, A.H. and Fadilah, S.I. and Yusoff, M.N.",conference,Muchtar201854,,"Budget control;  Costs;  Grid computing;  Remote control;  Technology transfer;  Testbeds, Algorithms and protocols;  Evaluation tool;  Low-cost electronics;  Low-cost robots;  MANET detailed;  Manet testbed;  Open hardware;  Rudimentary structures, Mobile ad hoc networks",MANET detailed;  Mobile Ad hoc Network;  real mobility;  real-testbed,54-59,9781538660263,"Singh P.K., Kumar Y., Ghrera S.P.",

The system is proved to be capable of overcoming the following state-of-the-art drawbacks: (i) the number of electrodes: a high number of electrodes increases the quality but is less comfortable for the user; (ii) the quality of the signal recorded in the scalp area of interest, typically covered with hair. At this aim, the authors propose: (i) the adoption of a single differential channel acquisition, in this case only three electrodes are used for the recording of the brain signal; (ii) the use of spring loaded pins electrodes in scalp area covered with hair to improve the contact and, as a consequence, the quality of recorded signal.

Rapid advancements in electronic technologies in the last few decades, as well as more recent widespread proliferation and adoption of electronic sensing and communications, have created many options to address the needs of professional, as well as amateur, researchers. In this study, an agricultural research project was undertaken to collect data and examine the effects of different agronomic practices on yield, with the objectives being to develop a monitoring system to measure soil moisture and temperature conditions in field plots and to upload the data to an internet website. The developed system included sensor nodes consisting of sensors and electronic circuitry to read and transmit sensor data via radio and a cellular gateway to receive node data and forward the data to an internet website via cellular infrastructure. Microcontroller programs were written to control the nodes and gateway, and an internet website was configured to receive and display sensor data. The battery-powered sensor nodes cost $170 each, including electronic circuitry and sensors, and they were operated throughout the cropping season with little maintenance on a single set of batteries. The solar-powered gateway cost $163 to fabricate, plus an additional cost of $2 per month for cellular network access. Wireless and cellular data transmissions were reliable, successfully transferring 95% of sensor data to the internet website.

However, moderate miniaturization offers many advantages and together with the transfer of modern print and media technologies to the field of chromatography (office chromatography) it opens up new avenues. This is demonstrated in an all-in-one open-source system developed for planar chromatography and especially for ultrathin-layer chromatography. Using an InkShield board to control a thermal inkjet cartridge, picoliter drops were printed at a resolution of 96 dpi on the adsorbent layer. Using Marlin, a popular firmware in 3D printing, Cartesian movement of the print head was made possible for full control of the printing process. Open-source software was developed to control the device in each operation step. Sample solutions and mobile phase were inkjet-printed, exemplarily shown for the analysis of dye- or paraben-mixture solutions. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were investigated for documentation. For example, deep UV LEDs gave access to 254 nm light, and RGB LEDs gave access to the visible-light range. Calibration functions with correlation coefficients superior to 0.999 were obtained by videodensitometry. The developed modular open-source hardware was compact (26 × 31 × 26 cm 3 ), light (&lt;3 kg), and affordable (€810).

This application requires dedicated transmit/receive (Tx/Rx) switches that support high peak powers for MRI and high average powers for RF heating. To meet this goal, we propose a high-performance Tx/Rx switch based on positive-intrinsic-negative diodes and quarter-wavelength (λ/4) stubs. Methods: The λ/4 stubs in the proposed Tx/Rx switch design route the transmitted RF signal directly to the RF coil/antenna without passing through any electronic components (e.g., positive-intrinsic-negative diodes). Bench measurements, MRI, MR thermometry, and RF heating experiments were performed at f = 297 MHz (B 0 = 7 T) to examine the characteristics and applicability of the switch. Results: The proposed design provided an isolation of −35.7dB/−41.5dB during transmission/reception. The insertion loss was −0.41dB/−0.27dB during transmission/reception. The switch supports high peak (3.9 kW) and high average (120 W) RF powers for MRI and RF heating at f = 297 MHz. High-resolution MRI of the wrist yielded image quality competitive with that obtained with a conventional Tx/Rx switch. Radiofrequency heating in phantom monitored by MR thermometry demonstrated the switch applicability for thermal modulation. Upon these findings, thermally activated release of a model drug attached to thermoresponsive polymers was demonstrated. Conclusion: The high-power Tx/Rx switch enables thermal MR applications at 7 T, contributing to the study of the role of temperature in biological systems and diseases.

Since its appearance more than 40 years ago, ICG has been used for assessing hemodynamic parameters. This paper presents a measurement system based on two System on Chip (SoC) solutions and Raspberry PI, implementing both a full three-lead ECG recorder and an impedance cardiographer, for educational and research development purposes. Raspberry PI is a platform supporting Do-It-Yourself project and education applications across the world. The development is part of Biosignal PI, an open hardware platform focusing in quick prototyping of physiological measurement instrumentation. The SoC used for sensing cardiac biopotential is the ADAS1000, and for the EBI measurement is the AD5933.

The proposed system utilizes low-level data from radar sensors as well as indirect (e.g. 3D imaging) and direct (e.g. LIDAR) Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors. After a configurable amount of pre-processing at sensor-level, the sensor data is transferred to a centralized platform and aligned temporally and spatially. We demonstrate the transformation of radar data into the 3D coordinate system in order to fuse it with point cloud data from ToF sensors.

Specifically, this paper describes the design, fabrication and operation of a RepRapable Recyclebot, which refers to the Recyclebot's ability to provide the filament needed to largely replicate the parts for the Recyclebot on any type of RepRap 3-D printer. The device costs less than $700 in mate rials and can be fabricated in about 24 h. Filament is produced at 0.4 kg/h using 0.24 kWh/kg with a diameter ±4.6%. Thus, filament can be manufactured from commercial pellets for <22% of commercial filament costs. In addition, it can fabricate recycled waste plastic into filament for 2.5 cents/kg, which is <1000X commercial filament costs. The system can fabricate filament from polymers with extrusion temperatures <250 °C and is thus capable of manufacturing custom filament over a wide range of thermopolymers and composites for material science studies of new materials and recyclability studies, as well as research on novel applications of fused filament based 3-D printing. © 2018 The Authors","Department of Mechanical Engineering-Engineering Mechanics, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI  49931, United States; Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, United States; Department of Materials Science & Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, United States; Department of Electronics and Nanoengineering, Aalto University, P.O.

Traditional methods involve operator intervention with gravimetric analysis to monitor the gross accuracy of full plate dispenses, visual verification of contents, or dedicated weigh stations on screening platforms that introduce potential bottlenecks and increase the plate-processing cycle time. We present a unique solution using open-source hardware, software, and 3D printing to automate dispenser accuracy determination by providing real-time dispense weight measurements via a network-connected precision balance. This system uses an Arduino microcontroller to connect a precision balance to a local network. By integrating the precision balance as an Internet of Things (IoT) device, it gains the ability to provide real-time gravimetric summaries of dispensing, generate timely alerts when problems are detected, and capture historical dispensing data for future analysis. All collected data can then be accessed via a web interface for reviewing alerts and dispensing information in real time or remotely for timely intervention of dispense errors.

Many small and specialty laboratories are excluded from the benefits of automation due to low sample number, cost, space, and/or lack of automation expertise. The Minimum Viable Option (MVO) automation platform was developed to address these hurdles and fulfill an unmet need. Consumer 3D printing enabled rapid iterative prototyping to allow for a variety of instrumentation and assay setups and procedures. Three MVO versions have been produced. MVOv1.1 successfully performed part of a clinical assay, and results were comparable to those of commercial automation. Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (RPI3) single-board computers with Sense Hardware Attached on Top (HAT) and Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2 hardware were remotely accessed and evaluated for their suitability to qualify the latest MVOv1.2 platform. Sense HAT temperature, barometric pressure, and relative humidity sensors were stable in climate-controlled environments and are useful in identifying appropriate laboratory spaces for automation placement. The RPI3 with camera plus digital dial indicator logged axis travel experiments. RPI3 with camera and Sense HAT as a light source showed promise when used for photometric dispensing tests.

The RISC-V instruction set and associated ecosystem is one such architecture that has become widely popular as the basis for the next generation embedded control systems and IoT devices. Despite the recent popularity of the RISC-V architecture, there is currently very little support for performing architectural experiments of high performance RISC-V devices designed to target high performance computing and high performance analytics applications. Further, there are no general purpose simulation infrastructures that support developing architectural experiments using RISC-V cores coupled to emerging memory devices such as HBM and HMC. As a result, there is currently a significant gap for those seeking to develop high performance architectural models using emerging memory devices and the RISC-V instruction set. The Stake infrastructure is designed to provide integrated simulation capabilities that supports experimentation using RISC-V processing cores as well as emerging memory devices. Stake is constructed using a fusion of the existing RISC-V Spike functional simulation infrastructure coupled to a custom memory generation component within the Sandia Structural Simulation (SST) framework. The result being an integrated simulation infrastructure that has the ability to simulate heterogeneous mixtures of hierarchical caches, traditional DRAM memories and emerging memory devices. We demonstrate this infrastructure with a design study to elicit the efficacy of 64 bit RISC-V cores on executing graph applications using different mixtures of cache, DRAM memories and HMC memories. In this study, we utilize the Graph Analytics Benchmark Suite to drive simulated memory traffic into mixtures of single level and multi-level caches coupled to each of the aforementioned backend memory devices. From this, we determine that in our simulated architecture, the HMC memory configuration with a single (L1) caching layer provides the most advantageous system configuration for executing graph algorithms and applications. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Tactical Computing Laboratories, Muenster, TX, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061005263&doi=10.1145%2f3240302.3240307&partnerID=40&md5=1483966510f028e5779a01f1a861455f,cited By 0,,10.1145/3240302.3240307,,,2018,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,Stake: A coupled simulation environment for RISC-V memory experiments,"Leidel, J.D.",conference,Leidel2018,,"Discrete event simulation;  Dynamic random access storage;  Embedded systems;  Memory architecture;  Mixtures;  Reduced instruction set computing, Embedded control systems;  Functional simulations;  Heterogeneous mixtures;  High performance computing;  Integrated simulations;  PDES;  Structural simulations;  System configurations, Cache memory",Discrete event simulation;  DRAM;  HMC;  PDES;  RISC-V;  SST,,9781450364751,,

These partnerships generally use a proprietary standard research agreement (PSRA), which for historical reasons contains significant IP monopoly language and restrictions for both the company and the university. Such standard research agreements thus create an artificial barrier to innovation as both companies using a libre model and universities they wish to collaborate with must invest significantly to restructure the contracts. To solve this problem, this article provides a new Sponsored Libre Research Agreement (SLRA). The differences between the agreements are detailed. The advantages of using an SLRA are provided for any type of company and include: (1) minimizing research investments on reporting requirements; (2) reducing delays related to confidentiality and publication embargos; and (3) reducing both transaction and legal costs as well as research time losses associated with IP. Moving to libre agreements both speeds up and reduces costs for setting up collaborative research.

First, design modifications for mechanical and electrical subsystems of the OS Distributed 3-D (D3D) Robotics prototyping system are provided. Next, Copper Carve, an OS custom graphical user interface, is developed to enable circuit board milling by implementing backlash and substrate distortion compensation. The performance of the OS D3D circuit mill is then quantified and validated for: positional accuracy, cut quality, feature accuracy, and distortion compensation. Finally, the return on investment is calculated for inventors using it. The results show by properly compensating for motion inaccuracies with Copper Carve, the machine achieves a motion resolution of 10 microns, which is more than adequate for most circuit designs. The mill is at least five times less expensive than all commercial alternatives and the material costs of the D3D mill are repaid from fabricating 20–43 boards.

The Kilogrid has been designed to extend the sensory-motor abilities of the Kilobot, to simplify the task of collecting data during experiments, and to provide researchers with a tool to fine-control the experimental setup and its parameters. Based on the design of the Kilobot and compatible with existing hardware, the Kilogrid is a modular system composed of a grid of computing nodes, or modules that provides a bidirectional communication channel between the Kilobots and a remote workstation. In this paper, we describe the hardware and software architecture of the Kilogrid system as well as its functioning to accompany its release as a new open hardware tool for the swarm robotics community. We demonstrate the capabilities of the Kilogrid using a 200-module Kilogrid, swarms of up to 100 Kilobots, and four different case studies: exploration and obstacle avoidance, site selection based on multiple gradients, plant watering, and pheromone-based foraging. Through this set of case studies, we show how the Kilogrid allows the experimenter to virtualize sensors and actuators not available to the Kilobot and to automatize the collection of data essential for the analysis of the experiments. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","IRIDIA, Université libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium; Beyond Center, School of Earth and Space Exploration, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, United States; Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Budapest, Hungary; School of Computing, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan; IRT Jules Verne, Nantes, France; ISTC, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Rome, Italy",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041107763&doi=10.1007%2fs11721-018-0155-z&partnerID=40&md5=e24016b613452abdc834a81916a73d89,cited By 9,,10.1007/s11721-018-0155-z,3,12,2018,Swarm Intelligence,Kilogrid: a novel experimental environment for the Kilobot robot,"Valentini, G. and Antoun, A. and Trabattoni, M. and Wiandt, B. and Tamura, Y. and Hocquard, E. and Trianni, V. and Dorigo, M.",article,Valentini2018245,,"Data acquisition;  Hardware;  Open source software;  Robotics;  Site selection;  Surface discharges;  Virtual reality;  Virtualization, Automated data collection;  Kilobot;  Kilogrid;  Open sources;  Swarm robotics, Swarm intelligence",Automated data collection;  Kilobot;  Kilogrid;  Open source;  Swarm robotics;  Tracking;  Virtualization,245-266,,,

The presented approach employs the Whipple model for the kinematic and inverse dynamic simulation of a bicycle ride using as an input three generalized coordinates registered with digital sensors. During the experimental phase, students ride the instrumented bicycle to collect the necessary sensor data. The kinematic and inverse dynamic simulations based on these signals provide a full picture of the motion of the system in different positions and at a range of velocities and accelerations. In addition, they estimate the traction, control, and tire-to-road contact forces during the ride. To validate the simulated results, the simulated velocity and accelerations are compared with the data acquired with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) installed on the bicycle.

Yet, the transformation from a laboratory based lab-on-a-chip technology to actual point-of-care device products has largely been limited to a fraction of the foreseen potential.

Lázaro Cárdenas s/n, Ciudad Universitaria Zona Sur, Mexico; email: aalarcon@uagro.mx","Background. A trainer for online laparoscopic surgical skills assessment based on the performance of experts and nonexperts is presented. The system uses computer vision, augmented reality, and artificial intelligence algorithms, implemented into a Raspberry Pi board with Python programming language. Methods. Two training tasks were evaluated by the laparoscopic system: transferring and pattern cutting. Computer vision libraries were used to obtain the number of transferred points and simulated pattern cutting trace by means of tracking of the laparoscopic instrument. An artificial neural network (ANN) was trained to learn from experts and nonexperts’ behavior for pattern cutting task, whereas the assessment of transferring task was performed using a preestablished threshold. Four expert surgeons in laparoscopic surgery, from hospital “Raymundo Abarca Alarcón,” constituted the experienced class for the ANN. Sixteen trainees (10 medical students and 6 residents) without laparoscopic surgical skills and limited experience in minimal invasive techniques from School of Medicine at Universidad Autónoma de Guerrero constituted the nonexperienced class. Data from participants performing 5 daily repetitions for each task during 5 days were used to build the ANN. Results. The participants tend to improve their learning curve and dexterity with this laparoscopic training system. The classifier shows mean accuracy and receiver operating characteristic curve of 90.98% and 0.93, respectively. Moreover, the ANN was able to evaluate the psychomotor skills of users into 2 classes: experienced or nonexperienced. Conclusion. We constructed and evaluated an affordable laparoscopic trainer system using computer vision, augmented reality, and an artificial intelligence algorithm. The proposed trainer has the potential to increase the self-confidence of trainees and to be applied to programs with limited resources. © The Author(s) 2018.","Universidad Autónoma de Guerrero, Chilpancingo, Guerrero, Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México UNAM, Ciudad de México, Mexico; Instituto Tecnológico de Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, Mexico; Instituto Politécnico Nacional, Ciudad de México, Mexico",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047802779&doi=10.1177%2f1553350618777045&partnerID=40&md5=325c45bf7c5360464fe7e8ac3106f7ff,cited By 5,,10.1177/1553350618777045,4,25,2018,Surgical Innovation,Development of a Laparoscopic Box Trainer Based on Open Source Hardware and Artificial Intelligence for Objective Assessment of Surgical Psychomotor Skills,"Alonso-Silverio, G.A. and Pérez-Escamirosa, F. and Bruno-Sanchez, R. and Ortiz-Simon, J.L. and Muñoz-Guerrero, R. and Minor-Martinez, A. and Alarcón-Paredes, A.",article,Alonso-Silverio2018380,,"accuracy;  algorithm;  area under the curve;  Article;  artificial neural network;  clinical article;  human;  laparoscopy;  learning;  medical school;  psychomotor performance;  questionnaire;  receiver operating characteristic;  sensitivity and specificity;  surgical training;  training;  artificial neural network;  education;  laparoscopy;  medical education;  medical student;  physiology;  task performance;  virtual reality, Education, Medical;  Humans;  Laparoscopy;  Neural Networks (Computer);  Psychomotor Performance;  ROC Curve;  Students, Medical;  Task Performance and Analysis;  Virtual Reality",augmented reality;  classification of MIS skills;  laparoscopy box simulator;  objective assessment,380-388,,,

TCPS data have characteristics that can be described using '5Vs of big data': (1) volume, (2) variety, (3) velocity, (4) veracity and (5) value (Demchenko et al., 2013) Volume represents the raw amount of data to be stored. Velocity represents the rate at which data are being collected and inserted into the data infrastructure and how fast the back end services are expected to process these data streams. The variety aspect arises from the fact that in a data-driven environment, it is inevitable for service providers to collect and combine data from numerous different sources for creating actionable insights. As a result, data will come into the infrastructure under different data formats. With increases in data size, rate of data arrival and number of data sources, the reliability of data contents will certainly decrease. This is the veracity aspect. The final V, value, represents the desired outcome for investing in TCPS data, because all efforts are for nought if usable insights cannot be generated from the data. All of these characteristics make traditional database management systems and conventional data processing and delivery systems inappropriate for many types of transportation data analysis and decision support tasks. An enormous amount of heterogeneous data cannot be processed in real time. This chapter introduces the modern data infrastructures that are needed to support TCPS. The focus is on open-source hardware and software technologies that support data management and delivery systems. The chapter also includes a discussion of infrastructure as code that can leverage emerging commercial cloud facilities. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The most concerning threats are hardware trojans. A hardware trojan is a malicious inclusion or alteration to the existing design of an integrated circuit, with the possible effects ranging from leakage of sensitive information to the complete destruction of the integrated circuit itself. While the majority of existing detection schemes focus on test-time, they all require expensive methodologies to detect hardware trojans. Off-the-shelf approaches have often been overlooked due to limited hardware resources and detection accuracy. With the advances in technologies and the democratisation of open-source hardware, however, these tools enable the detection of hardware trojans at reduced costs during or after production. In this manuscript, a hardware trojan is created and emulated on a consumer FPGA board. The experiments to detect the trojan in a dormant and active state are made using off-the-shelf technologies taking advantage of different techniques such as Power Analysis Reports, Side Channel Analysis and Thermal Measurements. Furthermore, multiple attempts to detect the trojan are demonstrated and benchmarked. Our simulations result in a state-of-the-art methodology to accurately detect the trojan in both dormant and active states using off-the-shelf hardware. © 2018 by the authors.

While the localized benefits of active control are well-established, the potential for system-scale control of watersheds is poorly understood. This study shows how a real-world smart stormwater system can be leveraged to shape streamflow within an urban watershed. Specifically, we coordinate releases from two internet-controlled stormwater basins to achieve desired control objectives downstream—such as maintaining the flow at a set-point, and generating interleaved waves. In the first part of the study, we describe the construction of the control network using a low-cost, open-source hardware stack and a cloud-based controller scheduling application. Next, we characterize the system’s control capabilities by determining the travel times, decay times, and magnitudes of various waves released from the upstream retention basins. With this characterization in hand, we use the system to generate two desired responses at a critical downstream junction. First, we generate a set-point hydrograph, in which flow is maintained at an approximately constant rate. Next, we generate a series of overlapping and interleaved waves using timed releases from both retention basins. We discuss how these control strategies can be used to stabilize flows, thereby mitigating streambed erosion and reducing contaminant loads into downstream waterbodies. © 2018 by the authors.

However, their computational demands are also growing, which constraints their use in mobile and time-sensitive robots. Biological vision presents a well known practical solution. Specifically, primates limit the computational demands of vision by processing only small parts of the scene in detail, and frequently reorienting the eyes to different locations. Artificial vision is much more power-intensive than biological vision, so this strategy is likely to be increasingly relevant to robots, as they become more visually sophisticated. To facilitate progress and reduce duplication of work in this area, we have developed a 7-degree-of-freedom robotic head that supports such rapid saccade-like camera movements, and we are releasing the design files under an open-hardware license. The system supports C-mount cameras, large foveated lenses, and liquid lenses that allow rapid changes in focus distance. It also has a stereo baseline that is roughly the same as that of humans, to support stereo processing of nearby objects in grasping and manipulation tasks. The main contributions of this work are the mechanical design, and the demonstration that its stereo baseline, range of motion, and saccade velocity are similar to those of primate systems. The main general advantages over existing robotic heads are speed and the open-hardware license.

Ecuador has 14% of the world's species and in 2014 its orchid exports increased 8%, this shows the importance of this product for the country. An orchid greenhouse is a botanical garden specialized in the cultivation, preservation and exhibition of orchids, these places require that physical variables such as ambient temperature, humidity and illuminance to be continuously monitored and controlled for the proper growth of orchids. The present work proposes the design, prototyping and deployment of a wireless sensor network for the monitoring of physical variables in the Municipal orchid greenhouse of Loja, based on open hardware technology. As a result, two prototypes were implemented: one from the variable monitoring node and the other from the central node for visualization and recording of variables. For the validation of the prototypes, performance tests were carried out in the field.

Ser.,English,,17426588,Institute of Physics Publishing,,"MANET (Mobile Ad Hoc Network) researchers have shown increased interest in using mobile robot technology for their testbed platforms. Thus, the main motivation of this paper is to review various robot-based MANET testbeds that have been developed in previously reported research. Additionally, suggestions to heighten mobility mechanisms by using mobile robots to be more practical, easy and inexpensive are also included in this paper, as we unveils ToMRobot, a low-cost MANET robot created from an ordinary remote control car that is capable of performing a real system MANET testbed with the addition of only a few low-cost electronic components. Despite greatly reduced costs, the ToMRobot does not sacrifice any of the necessary MANET basic structures and will still be easily customisable and upgradeable through the use of open hardware technology like Cubieboard2 and Arduino, as its robot controller. This paper will also include guidelines to enable technically limited MANET researchers to design and develop the ToMRobot. It is hoped that this paper achieves its two pronged objectives namely (i) to facilitate other MANET researchers by providing them with a source of reference that eases their decision making for selecting the best and most suitable MANET mobile robots for real mobility in their MANET testbeds (ii) to provide MANET researchers with a prospect of building their own MANET robots that can be applied in their own MANET testbed in the future. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Faculty of Computing, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Skudai, Johor, 81310, Malaysia; School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Gelugor, Pulau Pinang, 11800, Malaysia; Faculty of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Universiti Tun Hussein Onn, Johor Batu Pahat, 86400, Malaysia; Faculty of Art, Computing and Creative Industry, Universiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris, Tanjung Malim, Perak, 35900, Malaysia; Instrumental and Control Engineering, University Kuala Lumpur, MITEC, Persiaran Sinaran Ilmu, Bandar Seri Alam, Johor, 81750, Malaysia",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049906288&doi=10.1088%2f1742-6596%2f1019%2f1%2f012047&partnerID=40&md5=4a7b6809817eef54b30608988a238bab,cited By 2,012047,10.1088/1742-6596/1019/1/012047,1,1019,2018,Journal of Physics: Conference Series,Mobile Ad hoc Network Testbed Using Mobile Robot Technology,"Muchtar, F. and Abdullah, A.H. and Abd Wahab, M.H. and Ambar, R. and Hanafi, H.F. and Zawani Ahmmad, S.N.",conference,Muchtar2018,,"Costs;  Decision making;  Green computing;  Mobile robots;  Remote control;  Testbeds, Basic structure;  Low-cost electronics;  Manet testbed;  Mobility mechanisms;  Open hardware;  Robot controller;  Robot technology;  Test-bed platform, Mobile ad hoc networks",,,,,

324,Scopus,Conference Paper,"Proc. IEEE Conf. Industrial Electron. Appl., ICIEA",English,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"Robotic automation is considered as the fourth industrial revolution by multiple industrialists. Robots are faster, more accurate, less error-prone and cost-effective when compared to human beings. For big companies, it is estimated that by 2025, labor cost savings from the adoption of advanced industrial robots would surpass 20%. However, for small and medium companies, industrial robots are still expensive and unaffordable. Fortunately, with the advent of Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence, open source hardware and software, and the declining price of electronic components, a new generation of smaller, cheaper and friendlier robots are emerging, for small and medium businesses. In this paper, we propose the simulation of an Indoor Positioning System (IPS) robot, which performs a forklift operation in a warehouse. The system uses Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology, and Java programming language for exchanging data from a server. An ESP8266 NodeMCU module, an Arduino microcontroller and various components such as MFRC522 to read RFID tags, Ultrasonic Sensors HC-SR04 for detecting obstacles are used. This resulted in a very low cost, reliable and multifunctional system. Simulations have demonstrated that the mobile robot can transmit packets over the network to a local server for mapping without losses. Moreover, it can receive packets from the server to obtain destination points and mapping obstacles while moving around the RFID tagged floor. © 2018 IEEE.","Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Dept University of Mauritius, Reduit, Moka, Mauritius",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050073932&doi=10.1109%2fICIEA.2018.8397855&partnerID=40&md5=71a8d0d6098da60ca39a68919c328be7,cited By 2,,10.1109/ICIEA.2018.8397855,,,2018,"Proceedings of the 13th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications, ICIEA 2018",Indoor positioning system simulation for a robot using radio frequency identification,"Murdan, A.P. and Emambocus, M.Z.A.",conference,Murdan2018986,,"Cost effectiveness;  Costs;  Indoor positioning systems;  Industrial electronics;  Industrial robots;  Intelligent robots;  Internet of things;  Java programming language;  Mapping;  Open source software;  Open systems;  Radio;  Radio waves;  Wages, Arduino;  ESP 8266 NodeMCU;  Indoor positioning system (IPS);  Internet of Things (IOT);  Java;  Multifunctional systems;  Open sources;  Radio frequency identification technology, Radio frequency identification (RFID)",Arduino;  ESP 8266 NodeMCU;  indoor-positioning system;  Java;  open-source;  Radio Frequency Identification;  wireless,986-991,9781538637579,,

It aims at determining a portfolio of ciphers for authenticated encryption that has advantages over AES-GCM in terms of performance, security, and ease of implementation. This competition, for the first time, provides a standardized hardware API, which allows a fair comparison of hardware implementations. However, the community still lacks a common platform to automatically test hardware implementations, confirm implementation claims, and benchmark performance figures on real hardware in terms of runtime, area, power and energy consumption. In this work, we present a common platform using the CAESAR-API in a Xilinx Zynq-7000 System on Chip (SoC) with ARM processors and an AXI interface. This reflects a typical real world usage scenario for hardware-accelerators and thus extends the work for a fair comparison of hardware implementations in three dimensions: first the API is evaluated on a real SoC, which shows, e.g. the performance of the API. Second, it provides a hardware platform to test the proposed implementations of the candidates easily. This can be used by future designers, as we will provide it as open source hardware. Finally, we ran all published hardware implementations of the current 3rd-round candidates during which we identified several implementation weaknesses, e.g. presumably unintended latches in the design, hence emphasizing the importance of testing hardware proposals on real hardware. © 2018 IEEE.","Department of Security in Information Technology, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany; Cryptographic Engineering Research Group (CERG), Georg Mason University, Fairfax, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049951203&doi=10.1109%2fHST.2018.8383893&partnerID=40&md5=bae533c2fccf80ae3caea0aaa414b256,cited By 3,,10.1109/HST.2018.8383893,,,2018,"Proceedings of the 2018 IEEE International Symposium on Hardware Oriented Security and Trust, HOST 2018",The CAESAR-API in the real world - Towards a fair evaluation of hardware CAESAR candidates,"Tempelmeier, M. and De Santis, F. and Sigl, G. and Kaps, J.-P.",conference,Tempelmeier201873,,"Application programming interfaces (API);  Authentication;  Benchmarking;  Cryptography;  Energy utilization;  Open systems;  Programmable logic controllers;  System-on-chip, Authenticated encryption;  Automatically test;  Hardware accelerators;  Hardware implementations;  Hardware platform;  Open-source hardwares;  System on chips (SoC);  Testing hardwares, Hardware",,73-80,9781538647318,,

The techniques discussed have in common the use of accessible, community-built technologies for acquiring data. They are also concerned with embedding collaborative and open source principles into the objects, tools, social formations and data sharing practices that emerge from these inquiries. The focus is on developing processes of collaborative design and experimentation through material engagement with technology and issues of concern. Problem-solving, here, is a tactic, while the strategy is an ongoing engagement with the problem of participation in its technological, social and political dimensions especially considering the increasing centralization and specialization of scientific and technological expertise.

Eng.,English,,13361376,VSB-Technical University of Ostrava,,"To be able to use robots of the same type in a swarm (in this case differential–drive robots) from a centralized computer, you need to control them in the same way even if the robots come from different manufacturers. These robots should have the same capabilities: i.e. the same type of sensors and the same type of control commands. Currently, if we need to add sensors on a robot, we should first find out what are the hardware capabilities and what are the tools provided by the manufacturer (some have microcontrollers, others have ARM processors). The protocol to communicate with the onboard card (often a serial protocol) is different for each robot and we have to take that in account in our software so that the robots can be interchangeable. This paper describes the design and the results of using a standard interface (bridge) on a robot which allows wireless communication with a centralized computer and local serial communication with a mobile robot. On this interface, we can connect every sensor we want (infrared, ultrasound, laser, Kinect etc.) and we can always use the same tools to control them. Extension of the protocol of the Kobuki base (Turtle-Bot 2) is proposed to be able to use the same type of frame as the TurtleBot 2 uses and to continue to use ROS middleware as is, but with the possibility to use data from new sensors implemented on the bridge. This article will focus on the use of the TurtleBot 2, but the same bridge will be adapted to other robots allowing their interchangeability in the future. © 2018 ADVANCES IN ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING.","Center of Research “Ecoles de Saint–Cyr Coetquidan“, GUER Cedex, 56381, France; Department of Air Defence Systems, Faculty of Military Technology, University of Defence, Kounicova 65, Brno, 612 00, Czech Republic",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048951467&doi=10.15598%2faeee.v16i2.2439&partnerID=40&md5=8d0e19954127454395f54a078f0f48fc,cited By 3,,10.15598/aeee.v16i2.2439,2,16,2018,Advances in Electrical and Electronic Engineering,Design of an open hardware bridge between robots and ROS / non–ROS environments,"Bergeon, Y. and Krivanek, V.",article,Bergeon2018199,,,Differential–drive robot;  Interface;  Robotics;  ROS;  Swarm;  Turtlebot 2;  Unicycle robot,199-204,,,

Smart homes, smart streets, smart cities and eventually a smarter planet, is what humans are progressing towards. The boon in things being smart is that it involves automation and interactive technologies, something that we as humans prefer over introvert and monotonous characteristic of machines. However, most present systems have a physical entity like a remote or a personal device assistant (PDA) which is used to control our homes. When the access to these physical devices is lost, you can no longer control them. This paper addresses this very issue and proposes a solution which eliminates the need for any physical device. It proposes a multi-functional 'Smart Home Automation System' (SHAS) controlled using an interactive and humanoid central processing unit which is powered by features of AI and NLP. Voice-commands to control the devices of the house such as fans, lights, doors, etc. can be given by the residents. The system is also intelligent enough to search things which it doesn't quite understand using the internet. The system has a camera integrated for continuously monitoring the home and also uses image processing techniques to identify the people trying to access the house. The system also has an automated mailing system which e-mails photos captured by the camera based on valid/invalid users.

In the fields of materials science and mechanical engineering, fundamental equipment such as tensile testing devices can cost tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars. While a research lab often has access to a large-scale testing machine suitable for conventional samples, loading devices for meso- and micro-scale samples for in-situ testing with the myriad of microscopy tools are often hard to source and cost prohibitive. Open-source software has allowed for great strides in the reduction of costs associated with software development and open-source hardware and additive manufacturing have the potential to similarly reduce the costs of scientific equipment and increase the accessibility of scientific research. To investigate the feasibility of open-source hardware, a micro-tensile tester was designed with a freely accessible computer-aided design package and manufactured with a desktop 3D-printer and off-the-shelf components. To our knowledge this is one of the first demonstrations of a tensile tester with additively manufactured components for scientific research. The capabilities of the tensile tester were demonstrated by investigating the mechanical properties of Graphene Oxide (GO) paper and thin films. A 3D printed tensile tester was successfully used in conjunction with an atomic force microscope to provide one of the first quantitative measurements of GO thin film buckling under compression. The tensile tester was also used in conjunction with an atomic force microscope to observe the change in surface topology of a GO paper in response to increasing tensile strain. No significant change in surface topology was observed in contrast to prior hypotheses from the literature. Based on this result obtained with the new open source tensile stage we propose an alternative hypothesis we term ‘superlamellae consolidation’ to explain the initial deformation of GO paper. The additively manufactured tensile tester tested represents cost savings of >99% compared to commercial solutions in its class and offers simple customization. However, continued development is needed for the tensile tester presented here to approach the technical specifications achievable with commercial solutions. © 2018 Nandy et al.

Developments over the last decade in technology, open science, and the sharing economy promise to bring global access to more versatile and more affordable monitoring tools, to improve coverage for conservation researchers and managers. Here we describe the development and proof-of-concept of a low-cost, small-sized and low-energy acoustic detector: “AudioMoth.” The device is open-source and programmable, with diverse applications for recording animal calls or human activity at sample rates of up to 384 kHz. We briefly outline two ongoing real-world case studies of large-scale, long-term monitoring for biodiversity and exploitation of natural resources. These studies demonstrate the potential for AudioMoth to enable a substantial shift away from passive continuous recording by individual devices, towards smart detection by networks of devices flooding large and inaccessible ecosystems. The case studies demonstrate one of the smart capabilities of AudioMoth, to trigger event logging on the basis of classification algorithms that identify specific acoustic events. An algorithm to trigger recordings of the New Forest cicada (Cicadetta montana) demonstrates the potential for AudioMoth to vastly improve the spatial and temporal coverage of surveys for the presence of cryptic animals. An algorithm for logging gunshot events has potential to identify a shotgun blast in tropical rainforest at distances of up to 500 m, extending to 1 km with continuous recording. AudioMoth is more energy efficient than currently available passive acoustic monitoring devices, giving it considerably greater portability and longevity in the field with smaller batteries. At a build cost of ∼US$43 per unit, AudioMoth has potential for varied applications in large-scale, long-term acoustic surveys. With continuing developments in smart, energy-efficient algorithms and diminishing component costs, we are approaching the milestone of local communities being able to afford to remotely monitor their own natural resources. © 2017 The Authors.

We propose a novel software architecture based on open-software hardware platforms which allows programmers to create data streams from input channels and easily implement filters and frequency analysis objects. The performances of the different classes given in the size of memory allocated and execution time (number of clock cycles) were analyzed in the low-cost platform Arduino Genuino. In addition, 11 people took part in an experiment in which they had to implement several exercises and complete a usability test. Sampling rates under 250 Hz (typical for many biomedical applications) makes it feasible to implement filters, sliding windows and Fourier analysis, operating in real time. Participants rated software usability at 70.2 out of 100 and the ease of use when implementing several signal processing applications was rated at just over 4.4 out of 5. Participants showed their intention of using this software because it was percieved as useful and very easy to use. The performances of the library showed that it may be appropriate for implementing small biomedical real-time applications or for human movement monitoring, even in a simple open-source hardware device like Arduino Genuino.

The complex inner geometry of conventional slot dies require expensive machining that limits accessibility and experimentation. In order to overcome these issues this study follows an open hardware approach, which uses an open source 3-D printer to both fabricate the slot die and then to functionalize a 3-D slot die printing system. Polymer materials are tested and selected for compatibility with common solvents and used to fabricate a custom slot die head. This slot die is then integrated into a 3-D printer augmented with a syringe pump to form an additive manufacturing platform for thin film semiconductor devices. The full design of the slot die system is disclosed here using an open source license including software and operational protocols. This study demonstrates that functional lab-grade slot dies may be 3-D printed using low-cost open source hardware methods A case study using NiO 2 found an RMS value 0.486 nm, thickness of 17–49 nm, and a maximum optical transmission of 99.1%, which shows this additive manufacturing approach to slot die depositions as well of fabrication is capable of producing viable layers of advanced electronic materials.

The well-known simultaneous localization and mapping problem of mobile robots has been addressed in the literature without specifically taking into account the robot's motion control tasks. Moreover, its implementation can cost more than the robot itself. Robot motion control strategies developed in the literature either 1) rely on sophisticated hardware platforms, 2) assume noise-free environment, or 3) are based on abstract theories, which are validated using computer simulations only. The current work solves the navigation and mapping problems of mobile robots using open-source hardware and range-only measurements from a network of radio sources. The hardware platform used in this work is customized such that it is cost-effective and easy-to-implement, addressing the aforementioned issues in developing motion control strategies. The current strategy permits the robot to estimate its position and orientation and builds a map of its operating environment using radio frequency signals received from radio sources. It then navigates through a path defined by a set of two-dimensional points on the ground using a motion control strategy in cooperation with a computational intelligence tool. The proposed robot navigation and mapping scheme was tested in an indoor laboratory environment and its performance was compared with the simulation counterpart using a commercial robot simulator. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Bradley University, Peoria, IL  61625, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85038364732&doi=10.1109%2fTII.2017.2780247&partnerID=40&md5=b04a43b2c917959adfc27174b329c372,cited By 7,,10.1109/TII.2017.2780247,3,14,2018,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,Intelligent Range-Only Mapping and Navigation for Mobile Robots,"Miah, M.S. and Knoll, J. and Hevrdejs, K.",article,Miah20181164,,"Computation theory;  Computer hardware;  Control theory;  Cost effectiveness;  Extended Kalman filters;  Fuzzy filters;  Fuzzy logic;  Hardware;  Indoor positioning systems;  Intelligent robots;  Kalman filters;  Mapping;  Mobile robots;  Motion control;  Navigation;  Open systems;  Radio astronomy;  Radio navigation;  Robotics;  Wireless sensor networks, Laboratory environment;  localization;  Noise-free environments;  Position and orientations;  Radiofrequency signals;  Range-only measurements;  Simultaneous localization and mapping;  Simultaneous localization and mapping problems, Robots",Extended Kalman filter (EKF);  fuzzy logic;  localization;  mapping;  mobile robots;  motion control;  wireless sensor network (WSN),1164-1174,,,

WMSNs applications produce large amount of data, which require high transmission rates. An efficient and seamless delivery of multimedia services in WMSNs is still a challenging task. This article proposes an intelligent video surveillance platform (IVSP) for wireless multimedia sensor networks. IVSP presents the design of a networked system for joint rate control and error control of video over resource-constrained embedded devices. First, a combination of two different congestion indicators is introduced to differentiate between congestion levels and handle them accordingly. Second, a feedback-based rate controller is developed to maximize received video quality, in which sensor nodes can adaptively adjust their sending rates. Finally, a different retransmission mechanism for different packets is proposed. Lost packets can be stored temporarily and resend when free channel is available to avoid congestion. The core component of IVSP is an open source hardware platform, which is based on Raspberry Pi sensor nodes. IVSP is extensively evaluated on 7 Raspberry Pi sensor nodes. We present the results of 7-node real-world deployment of IVSP in a video surveillance application and show that it works well in long-term deployments. © 2018 by the authors.","Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, 518055, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042694892&doi=10.3390%2fapp8030348&partnerID=40&md5=d939f7fdfe630cfe10197f65ef194c2f,cited By 11,348,10.3390/app8030348,3,8,2018,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),Intelligent video surveillance platform for wireless multimedia sensor networks,"Abbas, N. and Yu, F. and Fan, Y.",article,Abbas2018,,,Congestion control;  Error control;  Wireless multimedia sensor networks;  Wireless sensor networks;  Wireless video transmission,,,,

The challenge is to consider all of the different structures and components available and build the optimal power management on a microscale. The purpose of this paper is to streamline the design process by creating a novel reconfigurable testbed called Medlay. First, we propose a uniform interface for management functions e.g., power conversion, energy storing and power routing. This interface results in a clear layout because power and status pins are strictly separated, and inputs and outputs have fixed positions. Medlay is the ready-to-use and open-hardware platform based on the interface. It consists of a base board and small modules incorporating e.g., dc-dc converters, power switches and supercapacitors. Measurements confirm that Medlay represents a system on one circuit board, as parasitic effects of the interconnections are negligible. The versatility regarding different setups on the testbed is determined to over 250,000 combinations by layout graph grammar. Lastly, we underline the applicability by recreating three state-of-the-art systems with the testbed.

In spite of the increasing popularity of this novel approach to intellectual property in product innovation, practice communities have faced difficulties to refine this concept into sharp and practical terms. There is to date no widely acknowledged criteria for determining whether a product is open source or not. Assuming OSH follows the same development path as Open Source Software and becomes a mainstream approach, the issue of conformance will also become critical for both producers and consumers. To address this gap, this contribution introduces a self-declared product openness marking scheme allowing to rate the openness of a product.

This paper presents two OSHWs developed for the diagnosis of heritage metal artefacts. The DiscoveryMat application allows the qualitative analysis of slightly oxidised metals such as copper and aluminium-based alloys, through the standardized monitoring of the variation of their corrosion potential (Ecorr) with time. The Pleco allows the local identification of corrosion products through linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) plots and this contributes to a better adjustment of conservation treatments on metal artefacts covered with heterogeneous corrosion layers through the selective intervention on some corrosion products and the preservation of others. If the Pleco can already be found in the toolbox of some conservation professionals, the DiscoveryMat application is still in its infancy and needs to be developed in the future as a participatory tool. © 2018, Research Trend.

These principles support the development of products in transparent processes allowing the participation of any interested person. While increasing numbers of products have been released as OSH, little is known on the prevalence of participative development practices in this emerging field. It remains unclear to which extent the transparent and participatory processes known from software reached hardware product development. To fill this gap, this paper applies repository mining techniques to investigate the transparency and workload distribution of 105 OSH product development projects. The results highlight a certain heterogeneity of practices filling a continuum between public and private development settings. They reveal different organizational patterns with different levels of centralization and distribution. Nonetheless, they clearly indicate the expansion of the open source development model from software into the realms of physical products and provide the first large-scale empirical evidence of this recent evolution. Therewith, this article gives body to an emerging phenomenon and contributes to give it a place in the scientific debate. It delivers categories to delineate practices, techniques to investigate them in further detail as well as a large dataset of exemplary OSH projects. The discussion of first results signposts avenues for a stream of research aiming at understanding stakeholder interactions at work in new product innovation practices in order to enable institutions and industry in providing appropriate responses.

Researchers and support organizations that are affiliated with the Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) are developing nano-based structures and components for advanced weaponry, aviation, and autonomous air/ground systems applications. The first key area consists of determining in-plane and out-of-plane shear properties of test articles made by 3D printing (Fused Deposition Modeling - FDM) and comparing to the conventional extrusion/forming sheet process. Test specimens are made from three polymer materials: acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), high impact poly-styrene (HIPS), and poly-lactic acid (PLA). Laboratory testing is performed according to the ASTM D3846-02 method for determining the in-plane shear strength, while the ASTM D5379 method is used for determining the out-of-plane shear properties. A description on how the 3D printing process advances the shear properties and has the potential of improving the in-plane and cross-sectional shear properties over the conventional manufacturing process is presented. The second key area demonstrates a set of materials, processes, and techniques that support the enabling of additive manufacture (AM) of RF components. Research activities are focused on developing open-source hardware/software multi-material direct digital printing, and producing 3D printed antenna, passive components, and connectors for C-band and Ku-band systems. Material studies have demonstrated a suitable material set for RF components and identified key material performance limits.

Firstly, based on the open source hardware of Fritz humanoid head robot, an integrated emotional expression mapping model was proposed by extending the functional module of voice, vision and so on. Secondly, to achieve a natural interaction between the expression robot and the operator, the integrated visual analysis is mainly utilised for emotion calculation. Haar-like featured cascade classified algorithm is utilised for automatic face location. Gabor feature is filtered and down-sampled as the emotional expression feature. To deal with unreasonable samples distribution in traditional eigenface, an optimised eigenvectors’s selection is built by comparing projection reconstructed images with original image.

Indirect low frequency ultrasonic energy (US), using baths, has been recently proposed as an effective alternative for crude oil demulsification. However, the reactor position during sonication and its influence on the demulsification efficiency for crude oil has not been evaluated. In this sense, the aim of this study was to develop an automated system based on an open source hardware for mapping the acoustic field distribution in an US bath operating at 35 kHz using a hydrophone. Data acquired with this system provided information to evaluate the demulsification efficiency in the different positions of the US bath and correlate it with the acoustic intensity distribution. The automated 3D-mapping system revealed a higher acoustic intensity in the regions immediately above the transducers (ca. 0.6 W cm−2), while the other regions presented a relatively lower intensity (ca. 0.1 W cm−2). Experimental data demonstrated that reactors positioned in the most intense acoustic regions provided a much higher efficiency of demulsification in comparison with the ones positioned in the less intense acoustic field regions. Demulsification efficiency up to 93% was obtained with 15 min of sonication (100% amplitude) using few amount of chemical demulsifier. Hence, this work demonstrated that the information acquired with the developed mapping system could be used for inducing a higher efficiency of demulsification only by finding the more suitable position of reactor in the US bath, which certainly will help development of appropriate reactors design when looking for such approach. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Departamento de Engenharia Química, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria, 97105-900 Santa MariaRS, Brazil; Departamento de Química, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria, 97105-900 Santa MariaRS, Brazil; Centro de Ciências Químicas, Farmacêuticas e de Alimentos, Universidade Federal de Pelotas, Pelotas, RS  96160-000, Brazil",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85017522102&doi=10.1016%2fj.ultsonch.2017.03.056&partnerID=40&md5=f079b0622e913263b67432729ea258c4,cited By 8,,10.1016/j.ultsonch.2017.03.056,,40,2018,Ultrasonics Sonochemistry,Intensification of ultrasonic-assisted crude oil demulsification based on acoustic field distribution data,"Pedrotti, M.F. and Enders, M.S.P. and Pereira, L.S.F. and Mesko, M.F. and Flores, E.M.M. and Bizzi, C.A.",article,Pedrotti201853,ULSOE,"Acoustic fields;  Acoustic intensity;  Acoustic transducers;  Automation;  Corrosion rate;  Demulsification;  Hardware;  Mapping;  Open systems;  Petroleum transportation, Acoustic field distribution;  Crude oil production;  Demulsification efficiency;  Intensity distribution;  Low frequency ultrasonic;  Low-frequency ultrasound;  Open-source hardwares;  Water separation, Crude oil, petroleum, acoustic analysis;  amplitude modulation;  Article;  automation;  chemical analysis;  controlled study;  demulsification;  emulsion;  molecular stability;  priority journal;  sound intensity;  three dimensional imaging;  ultrasound;  water content",Acoustic field mapping;  Crude oil demulsification;  Low frequency ultrasound;  Open source hardware;  Water separation,53-59,,,

It is particularly important for governments to regulate and control efficiently the use of this resource, as it is a strategic resource. The governments carry out the management of the radioelectric spectrum, but the demand for it, the increase of new wireless technologies and the misuse that certain clandestine companies make with the spectrum, require monitoring systems that are more efficient and sustained than the conventional equipment many times can not satisfy. Therefore, there are currently alternatives based on the concept of open source hardware and software that can be used to support spectrum monitoring activities using new concepts and architectures. This article presents an alternative for these measurements, which is known as software defined radio. This is a technique to build devices in which part of the hardware can be replaced by software routines, which reduces costs.

It can assist the engine design, shorten the development cycle, and help to reduce the research expense. Aeroengine simulation platform is widely used, especially in the field of aerospace engineering education. Digital simulation is mainly used to validate the initial test of the control algorithm, but the effectiveness of the simulation results is somewhat limited and can not be used as a final reference. As opposed to digital simulation, the traditional aeroengine hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation is a high confidence method in the control algorithm test, but it is bulky, expensive and not easy to maintain, so it is an urgent need to develop an embedded, miniaturized, and economic HIL simulation platform for the purpose of engineering education. The embedded HIL simulation platform proposed in this paper is based on two kinds of open source hardware: Raspberry Pi and Arduino. The Raspberry Pi will operate as an engine model and the Arduino board will function as the controller. They exchange data through the built-in serial ports. Efficient C codes of the aeroengine model are generated using Real-Time Workshop (RTW) tool.

In order to guarantee the robustness against the uncertainty of the actuator, we derive a model in which the robot body’s acceleration is the system’s control input. We then verify its validity by implementing a 2-DOF pendulum system using an omni-directional robot(ODR). The 2-DOF pendulum system can be stabilized without a mathematical model of the actuator in the proposed method. Therefore, it is possible to eliminate uncertainty in the actuator parameters. Furthermore, the method provides the advantages of flexible selection of motors used as actuators. First, we design a mechanical part to measure the angular velocity of the motor and to measure the inclination of an inverted pendulum. Second, we derive a mathematical model of a 2-DOF pendulum system for acceleration which the control input. The controller adopts the Linear Quadratic Regulator(LQR) to obtain the acceleration required for stabilization. The determined acceleration is converted to the velocity references of wheels through integration and transformation. The velocity references are followed through PI-velocity controllers.

To do so, a novel system based on machine vision and an image-processing algorithm was developed and tested in an open hardware and software PBF system. The system has the ability to analyze the quality of the powder bed by computing a defect ratio of the powder bed after each recoating operation. Then, this ratio is used as a performance variable in three full factorial Design of Experiments (DOE). The results show that the installation of machine vision and image processing system can potentially provide a signal to repeat the recoating process and correct the defect on the powder bed. At the same time, recoating process parameters can be adjusted dynamically to guarantee an optimum quality of the powder bed and minimize possible build failures.

Peer-production and contribution cultures are enfolded in a dynamic of resistance and appropriation in relation to capitalism. Opensource and contribution-based cultural processes have been critiqued as tending towards bureaucracy or becoming enfolded in a never-ending neoliberal imaginary from which escape or transcendence become impossible. An examination of the values expressed within a peer-production community challenges these perspectives and shows how ""operational pragmatics"" can provide moral justifications through reference to matters of principle and matters of design. Conflating these matters complicates claims about the inherent virtues of participation, especially in technical cultures. A qualitative analysis of an open-source hardware project shows how competing moral justifications unfold, and how the challenges that they pose to capitalism may be tenuous or temporary because of the way that justificatory regimes work within technology development under capitalism. © The Author(s) 2018.

The inexpensive prototypes use flexible inflatable wings that are arranged on ring kites, similar to how the rotor blades of a wind turbine are arranged on the hub. These autorotating rotary ring kites are stacked and integrated into a tensile structure that transfers the collected rotational power to a ground-based generator. A separate lifting kite provides additional lift to elevate the stack of rotary ring kites. Simulations and prototype testing show that network kite rigging provides the stabilizing benefits of wide tethering to networked individual kites even during fast flight for power generation. Turbulence effects are largely smoothed on individual kites. Stacked rotary ring kites can be integrated into a lattice of interconnected lifting kites, to concurrently run, at close proximity and thus allowing for greater land use efficiency. Solutions for joining the work of multiple ground stations to a single, more efficient generator are discussed. Software for kite network design is discussed.

Although there have been a large number of works done in the field of traffic data collection, there are several barriers which restrict the collection of traffic data at higher resolution in the cities. Installation and maintenance costs can act as a disincentive to use existing methods (e.g., loop detectors, video analysis) at a large scale and hence limit their deployment to only a few roads of the city. This paper presents an approach for vehicle counting using a low cost, simple and easily installable system. In the proposed system, vehicles (i.e., bicycles, cars, trucks) are counted by means of variations in the WiFi signals. Experiments with the developed hardware in two different scenarios—low traffic (i.e., 400 objects) and heavy traffic roads (i.e., 1000 objects)—demonstrate its ability to detect cars and trucks. The system can be used to provide estimates of vehicle numbers for streets not covered by official traffic monitoring techniques in future smart cities. © 2018 by the authors.

Against this background, I attempt to grasp innovation communities as a distinct type of meso-level order. Here, the general conflicts that shape the institutional foundations of collective innovation play out in the context of gradually settled fields, where community and business logics compete over the legitimate ways to shape the particular innovation at stake. Consequently, the resulting fields reflect an ambiguous institutional environment that affects not only the general conditions under which innovation communities create and develop potentially innovative artifacts (like 3D printers), but also the particular opportunities and struggles that accompany corresponding approaches for commercial exploitation. As the dilemma of entrepreneurship in open hardware usually refers to community members that develop entrepreneurial ambitions to commercialize community-based innovations, Chap. 3 also emphasizes the micro level of individual actors and their agentic capacities to relieve tensions within a complex and potentially contradictive institutional environment. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Technische Universität, Berlin, Germany",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064896778&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-66842-0_3&partnerID=40&md5=4764e0e2fb34b471d5888dd700a9e3e6,cited By 0,,10.1007/978-3-319-66842-0_3,,,2018,Contributions to Management Science,Theorizing innovation communities,"Ferdinand, J.-P.",article,Ferdinand201835,,,,35-67,,,

For instance, citizens in many developing countries lack access to energy, and suffer from a lack of energy independence, scarcity, and high energy costs. Efforts are underway to make energy generation, transmission, and consumption more efficient via the application of modern communications and control. In this paper we focus on a communications and demand-side control application for legacy appliances. Instead of replacing existing devices with new “smart” devices with better communications capability, we integrate legacy devices into a centralized control system. We designed and implemented a communications system that allows control of infrared-enabled appliances over a network using wired or wireless communications. We designed a web application and user interface that can function remotely over the Internet, and use microcontrollers and infrared transmitters to communicate with infrared-enabled devices. We demonstrate a prototype of the system to control air conditioning units in a commercial building for energy management. The system uses open source hardware, software, and protocols. While we use energy management as an example, we focus on the general communications and control architecture, which is easily scalable and applicable to other devices and applications beyond those demonstrated here. © 2018, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Kigali, United States; College of Engineering and Applied Science, University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, CO  80309-0530, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032868254&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-66742-3_14&partnerID=40&md5=cc28b3df8710bb223556c120abde6f4b,cited By 0,,10.1007/978-3-319-66742-3_14,,208,2018,"Lecture Notes of the Institute for Computer Sciences, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering, LNICST",Design and Implementation of an Internet of Things Communications System for Legacy Device Control and Management,"Saint, M. and Garba, A.A. and Byishimo, A. and Gasore, R.",article,Saint2018145,,"Air conditioning;  Automation;  Developing countries;  Energy management;  Infrared radiation;  Intelligent buildings;  Internet;  Internet of things;  Office buildings;  Open source software;  Open systems;  Pulse width modulation;  Telecommunication;  User interfaces;  Voltage control;  Wi-Fi;  Wireless telecommunication systems, Building automation systems;  Centralized control systems;  Communications and control;  Communications capability;  Design and implementations;  E-infrastructures;  Internet of Things (IOT);  Machine to machines, Energy management systems",Building automation system;  eInfrastructure;  Energy management system;  Infrared;  Internet;  Internet of Things (IoT);  m2m;  Machine-to-machine;  Pulse Width Modulation (PWM);  Smart building;  Telecommunications;  Wi-Fi,145-154,9783319667416,"Bissyande T.F., Sie O.",

Well-known are the professional fields of Open Source Software, Open Hardware and Open Innovation, as well as academic research. At its core, documentation is about transferring information beyond one specific project team, site or time frame. We specifically explore Participatory Design projects, wherein this type of information exchange remains a challenge for many researchers. From a literature study about how to support making documentation in Open Source Software and Hardware practices, we learn how to elicit skill building and intrinsic motivation. We complement these insights with two Participatory Design practices that already use a form of documentation, i.e. design games and sensitizing. We distinguish five characteristics that designers can use to implement documentation in the design process by balancing between skill building and intrinsic motivation, and propose the concept of ‘documentation games’ as a format supporting this. We exemplify this approach through three case studies and assess how the five characteristics and the documentation games provide handholds to include documentation to support long-term engagements in participatory design processes. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Oswald Devisch, Liesbeth Huybrechts, Roel De Ridder.","LUCA School of Arts, KULeuven, TRADERS, Belgium; Hasselt University, Belgium; Hasselt University, Research projects Traders and Critical Heritage, SocialSpaces, Belgium",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059598162&doi=10.4324%2f9781315110332&partnerID=40&md5=cf8020ebc3c951962f72672694b2a52b,cited By 0,,10.4324/9781315110332,,,2018,Participatory Design Theory: Using Technology and Social Media to Foster Civic Engagement,Documentation games: A comparison between three games to support participatory design teams to document their design process,"Schoffelen, J. and Huybrechts, L. and Devisch, O.",book,Schoffelen2018247,,"Motivation;  Open source software;  Open systems;  Systems analysis, Academic research;  Good practices;  Information exchanges;  Intrinsic motivation;  Literature studies;  Open innovation;  Participatory design;  Professional fields, Design",,247-262,9781351615754; 9781138087682,,

In this work different possibilities of the integration of wearable devices on the example of the development of a fall prevention system are presented and classified. We started with a commercial off-the-shelf one-on-one system (Shimmer/Arduino) using a Bluetooth connection, integrated via nurse call system as Human-Machine-Interface. During the evaluation of the system we mentioned several new requirements and optimization possibilities. Thus, we adjusted the hardware-software-system; the near-field communication was realized by IEEE802.15.4, we replaced commercial off-the-shelf devices with highly-specialized open hardware in-house developments and we transferred the nurse call integration by setting up our own network and integrating this into an existing (wireless) local area network.

These devices utilize thermal radiation for comparison and determination of their efficiency. Because of this wide use associated with the development of new technologies, a simple and low-cost version of thermal pyranometer has been studied, designed and manufactured. A blackened aluminum disk is used as a hot junction, and the cold junction is exposed to ambient air. The two terminals are connected to a digital amplifier with output signal directed to an Arduino board. A device calibration was performed by comparing the results with a commercial photodiode sensor. Statistical analysis of the calibration data considering a 99% confidence level leads to an estimated standard error of 20.8 W/m2. An analysis of its response time also estimated from a dynamic model. This model uses a numerical solution of the energy balance on heat exchange between the aluminum disc and the environment. The instrument response time based on the average of the estimates obtained from the dynamic model is about 1.5 minutes. Based on these studies it was concluded that the characteristics of the sensor are adequate for most solar energy tests and the final cost of US $ 60.00 is much lower than the large majority of such commercial devices. © 2018 International Journal of Thermodynamics.

A nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX) was implemented in a serial-parallel architecture. The PV module mathematical modeling was developed, a buck converter was designed to operate in the continuous conduction mode with a switching frequency of 20 KHz, and the dynamic neural controller was designed using the Neural Network Toolbox from Matlab/Simulink (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA), and it was implemented on an open-hardware Arduino Mega board. To obtain the reference signals for the NARX and determine the 65 W PV module behavior, a system made of a 0.8WPV cell, a temperature sensor, a voltage sensor and a static neural network, was used. To evaluate performance a comparison with the P&O traditional algorithm was done in terms of response time and oscillations around the operating point. Simulation results demonstrated the superiority of neural controller over the P&O. Implementation results showed that approximately the same power is obtained with both controllers, but the P&O controller presents oscillations between 7 W and 10W, in contrast to the inverse controller, which had oscillations between 1 W and 2 W. © 2017 by the authors.

In engineering and geotechnical engineering in particular this is not discussed in detail. However, research in soil mechanics is often done with highly specialized and expensive equipment. This research can not repeated or the testing methodology is seldom applied with a different soil type due to the availability of the testing protocol and equipment. Nowadays, the increasing accessibility of 3-D printing facilities, single-board computer and micro-controllers lead to new opportunities and ways to overcome this challenges. The aim of this contribution is to shed some light on this facts and discuss opportunities to improve the scientific situation with respect of open science in soil mechanics. To the authors best knowledge this is a novel application of Open Science in geotechnical engineering. The developed device is called Open Science interface shear device (OSInterface), which will act as a pilot project to demonstrate the opportunities using methods that are applied for example for open source software development in open hardware development with a focus to geotechnical engineering. Basically, this interface shear device differs not much from existing shear devices but the development and the construction is accessible to everyone.

This amplification is connected with the resonant frequency, which can be estimated applying the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (H/V) method on seismic noise measurements. In this work, a low-cost user-friendly data acquisition system (Geophonino-3D) has been designed for three-component seismic noise recording. The developed system consists of the signal conditioning circuit and the Arduino Due with an SD Shield for data storage. The suitability of the equipment for the application of the H/V method has been first assessed in the laboratory, according to the experimental sensitivity, the internal noise stability and the channel consistency. Subsequently, experimental verification has been carried out by recording seismic noise at eight different sites along the province of Alicante (southeast Spain), with different soil characteristics. The performance of the developed acquisition system has been evaluated in terms of the power spectral density and the H/V peaks by comparison with the results obtained through a commercial seismic recorder. The obtained results show the applicability of the developed acquisition system to record seismic noise and to apply the H/V method. Geophonino-3D is an open source and open hardware system and the price of its components is much lower than any other commercial equipment, which becomes a significant advance especially for small research groups with reduced economic support. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Department of Earth Sciences and Environment, University of Alicante, Crta.

San Vicente, s/n, Spain; email: basilio@ua.es","Purpose: Vertical jump tests are used to assess lower-limb power of athletes in sport sciences. Flight time measurement with jump-mat systems is the most common procedure for this purpose. The aim of this study was to analyze the concurrent validity and reliability of two proprietary systems (Globus and Axon) and an open-source system (Chronojump). Methods: A conditioning electric circuit governed by a controlled wave generator is designed to substitute athletes jumping on a physical mat. In order to look for possible differences associated to timekeeping by each microcontroller device, all three systems are fed by the circuit simultaneously. Results: Concurrent validity was high for the three systems. Standarized typical error of estimate (TEE) was trivial, according to MBI interpretation as well as perfect Pearson correlation coefficient. Reliability was assessed based on the coefficient of variation of flight time measure, resulting in 0.17–0.63% (0.05–0.12 cm) for Globus, 0.01% (0.09 cm) for Chronojump and 5.65–9.38% (2.15–3.53 cm) for Axon. These results show that all jump-mat system produced nearly identical measures of flight time so they can be considered valid and reliable for practical purposes. In comparison, Chronojump showed the best performance whereas Axon showed enough variability and disagreement to pose a problem in testing elite athletes. Conclusions: These experiments show that open-source jump mats are as valid and reliable as their proprietary counterparts at a lower cost. Therefore, practitioners can be confident in using Globus or Chronojump systems to test athletes’ jump height because of their negligible errors and Axon system to monitor general population. © 2018, Institute of Machine Design and Operation.

Although World Meteorological Organization (WMO) recommends minimum station densities for different physiographic areas with some detailed standards on siting and calibrating the instruments used in the stations, it doesn't provide any guideline to select optimum locations to deploy the stations. The adequacy of the stations vary with the weather condition of the area and the measured parameters. Since some of the most widely used parameters in hydrological modelling, such as precipitation can vary greatly with small distances, in reality, the required density is higher than the recommended density by the WMO. This research was conducted in a period where the University of Moratuwa of Sri Lanka is conducting a research project called 4ONSE (4 times Open and Non-Conventional technology for Sensing the Environment) in collaboration with University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland. The project involves deploying low cost, open technologies (open hardware, software, data and standards) based hydrometeorological stations in Deduru Oya river basin of Sri Lanka. The process of determining the optimum locations for the stations started with discretizing the watershed into sub-basins. Satellite retrieved weather data was applied in Shannon's Entropy method to measure the spatial distribution of uncertainty levels of precipitation. In addition, requirements of the hydrological modeling software (SWAT) and several other factors were considered in determining the number and the locations for the stations. The method presented in this research is an experimental approach of deploying the 4ONSE stations in real world. © 2018 Proceedings - 39th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing: Remote Sensing Enabling Prosperity, ACRS 2018","Department of Town and Country Planning, Faculty of Architecture, University of Moratuwa, Bandaranayake Mawatha, Moratuwa, 10400, Sri Lanka; University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland, Via Trevano, Canobbio, 6952, Switzerland",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071864657&partnerID=40&md5=deb6336a5a5630bd112756a5c29240cd,cited By 1,,,,2,2018,"Proceedings - 39th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing: Remote Sensing Enabling Prosperity, ACRS 2018",An approach to determine the optimum spatial distribution of weather station network for hydrological modeling: 4Onse deployment,"Warusavitharana, E. and Ratnayake, R. and Mahanama, S. and Cannata, M.",conference,Warusavitharana2018805,,"Hydrology;  Location;  Meteorology;  Remote sensing;  River basin projects;  Spatial distribution;  Water management, 4ONSE;  Deployment;  Hydrological modeling;  Hydrometeorological data;  Shannon's entropy methods;  University of applied science;  Waterresource management;  World meteorological organizations, Electric substations",4ONSE;  Deployment;  Hydrological modeling;  Hydrometeorological stations,805-814,,,

Era Digitalization, NordDesign",English,,,The Design Society,,"Open platform architecture products (OPAP) are the key enablers for Product design for Mass Individualisation. It is a new product design paradigm that comprises an open hardware platform, mass-produced by large manufacturers and multiple independent modules, invented and produced by other smaller companies and by the end-user that are integrated with the platform. It gives freedom to end-users to integrate different modules into the platform as per their choice. This type of product integration will be engaged with by the all actors involved in the design and aims to help them to be more creative and innovative. The end product will be highly individualised and technologically advanced. Based on explorative literature analysis, with practical insights from an industrial questionnaire survey, an Innovation toolkit for the end-user has been developed. The Innovation toolkit provides a mean of selecting an optimal module option for each module which will be integrated on the hardware platform. The design of the Innovation toolkit for OPAP has been approached in three different steps: Modelling of OPAP, Modelling of evaluation measures and evaluation indices with end-user preferences and Identification of the optimal module options. In this work, variations in module options for a given module are modelled by an AND-OR tree and parameters of the nodes in this tree. Different module options for the selected module are evaluated by various evaluation measures. These evaluation measures are converted into comparable customer satisfaction indices. The optimal OPAP is identified by constrained optimisation of the overall customer satisfaction index. Two case studies have been presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the introduced Innovation toolkit. These case studies illustrate that the Innovation toolkit can readily be applied to these types of product development to obtain a highly individualised OPAP with optimised module options. © Proceedings of NordDesign: Design in the Era of Digitalization, NordDesign 2018.

Thanks to their wide availability, low price, and open adaptability they are widely used in broad communities among makers and artists as well as in schools and universities. They can serve as scientific platforms e.g. as interfaces, sensor data handling or distributed computing platforms. Due to the large spread and user number, as well as the accessibility of the design, bugs are likely to be found and patched, leaving a reliable system. A variety of open source operating systems and programs with a multitude of easy to use libraries decreases the complexity in the development of new soft- and hardware. This offers the great opportunity even in space business to use them as an engineering model, to build laboratory breadboards, or as an experimental platform. Beside the evolution of the boards also the requirements for on-board computers and payload data handling units have increased considerably, even on very small satellites. Computers like the Raspberry Pi or BeagleBone are able to increase computational power and at the same time decreasing size, mass, complexity, and power consumption. They are very well suited for tasks such as image processing, handling of large data, or operation in general. When being able to use them as flight model directly development time and system adaptations can be decreased to a minimum. We tested both Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone modules. This paper focuses on the characterization and total ionizing dose (TID) test of the smallest board in the BeagleBone family, the PocketBeagle. The PocketBeagle has a footprint comparable to a matchbox and hosts an 1 GHz ARM processor with 512 MB RAM and integrated power management. Besides the ARM-SoC the PocketBeagle only hosts a SD-card memory slot and a USB interface. We will describe the test setup, parameters, and routines during the test campaign. Further we will present the characterization and discuss the performance during and after the TID test. The TID of this test was equivalent to a 2-years mission in LEO. The SoC on the PocketBeagle passed the tests. This paper is a step towards trusting and using open source technology and COTS systems in space.

NASA is committed to engaging citizen scientists with opportunities to develop novel solutions that can assist in bridging technology gaps related to human spaceflight. Four years ago, NASA entered into a Space Act Agreement with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Foundation to inspire students with real-world engineering problems through a series of engineering challenges that leverage the 3D Printing in Zero-G Technology Demonstration aboard the International Space Station (ISS). With technical assistance from NASA, ASME designs and conducts K-12 engineering design challenges using the Future Engineers challenge platform allowing participants to use their imaginations and 3D modeling software to design items related to future space exploration missions. The Future Engineers web presence hosts challenges, provides links to free modeling software, and features an open hardware design repository showcasing student software models. At the end of each challenge, a committee that includes NASA personnel and experts on 3D printing in space, reviews all submissions and selects several designs for final review. Finalists are then interviewed by a judging panel with winners selected in Junior (ages 5-12) and Teen (ages 13-19) age divisions. Through this innovative collaboration, winners have received behind-the-scenes tours of NASA, SpaceX, Bigelow Aerospace, Digital Domain, and MakerBot, and had their designs printed on the 3D printer aboard the ISS. Since 2014, the challenges have successfully engaged over 2,700 students from 46 states to use their imaginations to design and create 3D engineering models related to items astronauts may need in the future. Thirty-nine percent of participants are female, a traditionally underrepresented group in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) careers. This paper provides an overview of received submissions, winning designs, success stories, and lessons learned. It will also detail the relationship, the unique assets of each organization, and the roles of each in implementing the challenges. We share details on the management, promotion, summative information about participants, and next steps for the effort. The projects resulting from these Future Engineers challenges have greatly surpassed expectations, increased NASA's body of knowledge in In-Space Manufacturing, and inspired and engaged the next generation of space explorers.

Field Ready uses distributed manufacturing to produce essential non-food items locally where they are needed during humanitarian responses. Such supplies can be available to communities in need and to relief workers more quickly, more cheaply than alternatives, and provide appropriate solutions to problems, often engaging local people in designing and making necessary items, and supporting economic development. Scaling up this requires local production capabilities (skills, tools, and information such as designs), which can be boosted by adoption of these methods by aid agencies, international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) and others. Local manufacturing offers the potential for disaster affected communities to be engaged in recovery, and long term to become more resilient, with access to all the equipment and information required to make the supplies they need. However, there are challenges: appropriate quality control for distributed manufacture, unlocking the potential for in-region manufacturers to engage in humanitarian response, and uptake of digital knowledge sharing and collaboration to the humanitarian sector.

Conf., Proc.",English,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"Soil and nutrient depletion from intensive use of land is a critical issue for food production. An understanding of whether the soil is adequately treated with appropriate crop management practices in real-time during production cycles could prevent soil erosion and the overuse of natural or artificial resources to keep the soil healthy and suitable for planting. Precision agriculture traditionally uses expensive techniques to monitor the health of soil and crops including images from satellites and airplanes. Recently there are several studies using drones and a multitude of sensors connected to farm machinery to observe and measure the health of soil and crops during planting and harvesting. This paper describes a real-time, in-situ agricultural internet of things (IoT) device designed to monitor the state of the soil and the environment. This device was designed to be compatible with open hardware and it is composed of temperature and humidity sensors (soil and environment), electrical conductivity of the soil and luminosity, Global Positioning System (GPS) and a ZigBee radio for data communication. The field trial involved soil testing and measurements of the local climate in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The measurements of soil temperature, humidity and conductivity are used to monitor soil conditions. The local climate data could be used to support decisions about irrigation and other activities related to crop health. On-going research includes methods to reduce the consumption of energy and increase the number of sensors. Future applications include the use of the IoT device to detect fire in crops, a common problem in sugar cane crops and the integration of the IoT device with irrigation management systems to improve water usage. © 2017 IEEE.","Computer Science Dept., Centro Universitário FEI, São Bernardo do Campo, Brazil; Faculty of Engineering, Environment and Computing, Coventry University, Coventry, United Kingdom",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047478626&doi=10.1109%2fGHTC.2017.8239290&partnerID=40&md5=d030fcf3a77a09d28f1324485ff28d49,cited By 13,,10.1109/GHTC.2017.8239290,,2017-January,2017,"GHTC 2017 - IEEE Global Humanitarian Technology Conference, Proceedings",Precision agriculture using remote monitoring systems in Brazil,"Maia, R.F. and Netto, I. and Tran, A.L.H.",conference,Maia20171,,"Agricultural machinery;  Crops;  Global positioning system;  Health;  Internet of things;  Irrigation;  Precision agriculture;  Radio communication;  Remote control;  Soil testing;  Soils;  Sugar cane, agri-tech;  Crop management practices;  Internet of Things (IOT);  Irrigation management systems;  Remote monitoring;  Remote monitoring system;  Temperature and humidity sensor;  Testing and measurements, Soil surveys",agri-tech;  internet of things;  precision agriculture;  remote monitoring,1-6,9781509060467,,

Development of UUVs has been driven by defense and commercial requirements. This has allowed for extensive research and development budgets and long development cycles. This paper briefly discuses these historic drivers and how this situation has changed. It focuses on a new compact affordable UUV. In 2015, several veterans of the conventional UUV sector set out to change the dynamics of the industry, founding Riptide Autonomous Solutions. Riptide's first offering was the micro-UUV, a new, highly flexible, open source autonomous undersea vehicle. The micro-UUV features open hardware and software interfaces giving users a reliable and robust platform to advance technology development. The vehicle design is optimized for high efficiency with the best hydrodynamic signature in its class. The base micro-UUV is 4 7/8 inches in diameter, 40 inches in length and weighs 22 lbs. The standard system is rated to a depth of 300 meters. This paper discuses the technical details of this UUV that make it distinctive and enabled its rapid development. The entire system was taken from design to initial delivery in under 12 months. Flexible and open software interfaces and use of modern three - dimensional design and printing are key enablers of the rapid development. A highly optimized hydrodynamic design improves the speed and endurance of the vehicle, as does its compact size. Reducing control fins from the typical four to three reduces drag and enables active roll control steering, a further enhancement of the micro-UUV's performance. In addition to describing the novel features and approach of the micro-UUV design this paper will discuss the potential for a new aluminum seawater battery to extend the range of this compact vehicle to nearly 1000km. © 2017 Marine Technology Society.","Just Innovation, Inc., Boston, MA, United States; Riptide Autonomous Solutions Inc., Pembroke, MA, United Kingdom",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048153693&partnerID=40&md5=d9f656af18a06898f02fcca2f05cf2dc,cited By 0,,,,2017-January,2017,OCEANS 2017 - Anchorage,Rapid development and evolution of a micro-UUV,"Manley, J.E. and Smith, J.",conference,Manley20171,,"Anchorages (foundations);  Budget control;  Hydrodynamics;  Open source software;  Submersibles, Active roll control;  Autonomous undersea vehicles;  Commercial requirements;  Hydrodynamic design;  Research-and-development budget;  Technology development;  Three-dimensional designs;  Unmanned undersea vehicles, Unmanned underwater vehicles",,1-4,9780692946909,,

We hypothesize that existing hardware construction languages (HCLs) and novel hardware compiler frameworks (HCFs) can put hardware development on a similar evolutionary path by enabling new hardware libraries to be independent of underlying process technologies including FPGA mappings. We support this claim by (1) evaluating the degree with which Chisel, an existing HCL, can support powerfully parameterized libraries, and (2) introducing the concept and implementation of an HCF that uses an open-source hardware intermediate representation, FIRRTL (Flexible Intermediate Representation for RTL), to transform target-independent RTL into technology-specific RTL.

Historically, the solutions to each of these challenges have been custom and rarely replicated exactly. For the IMS research community few detailed resources exist that explicitly detail the construction and operation of ion mobility systems. In an effort to address this knowledge gap we outline a solution to one of the key aspects of a drift tube ion mobility system, the ion gate pulser. Bradbury-Nielsen or Tyndall ion gates are found in nearly every research-grade and commercial IMS system. While conceptually simple, these gate structures often require custom, high-voltage, floating electronics. In this report we detail the operation and performance characteristics of a wifi-enabled, MOSFET-based pulser design that uses a lithium-polymer battery and does not require high voltage isolation transformers. Currently, each output of this circuit follows a TTL signal with ~20 ns rise and fall times, pulses up to +/− 200 V, and is entirely isolated using fiber optics.

Here we describe a high-performance, low-cost, open hardware pressure ejection system (Openspritzer), which can be constructed from off the shelf components. The device is capable of delivering minute doses of reagents to a wide range of biological and chemical systems. In this work, we characterise the performance of the device and compare it to a popular commercial system using two-photon fluorescence microscopy. We found that Openspritzer provides the same level of control over delivered reagent dose as the commercial system. Next, we demonstrate the utility of Openspritzer in a series of standard neurobiological applications. First, we used Openspritzer to deliver precise amounts of reagents to hippocampal neurons to elicit time- and dose-precise responses on neuronal voltage. Second, we used Openspritzer to deliver infectious viral and bacterial agents to living tissue. This included viral transfection of hippocampal interneurons with channelrhodopsin for the optogenetic manipulation of hippocampal circuitry with light.

Fluorescence measurement is typically achieved by utilizing a blue or red monochromatic excitation light source. However, algal photosynthetic pigments can differ in their absorption spectra, potentially leading to excitation wavelength dependent measurements of maximal and light acclimated PSII photosynthetic quantum yield (Fv/Fm or Fq'/Fm') and functional absorption cross section (σPSII or σPSII'). Here we utilized an open source hardware development platform to construct a multispectral excitation fluorometer to assess spectrally dependent differences in photochemistry within four different Symbiodinium species (two of each ITS2-type A4 and B1). Multivariate analysis of light acclimated photochemical signatures showed separation between most alga types. These spectrally dependent differences in light acclimated PSII efficiency and PSII functional absorption cross section likely reflect changes in light harvesting compounds, their connectivity to the PSII reaction centers and the balance between photochemical and non-photochemical fluorescence quenching. Additionally, acclimation to low (20 μmol photons m-2s-1) and high (200 μmol photons m-2 s-1) light conditions was examined in two of these symbionts types (ITS-2 type A4 and B1) As expected, chlorophyll a cell-1 decreased under high light acclimation in both symbionts. However, only A4 saw a subsequent reduction in absorbance whereas cellular volume decreased in the B1 (S. minutum) symbiont. In response to high light acclimation, Fv/Fm was significantly lower at all excitation wavelengths for the B1 symbiont where as efficiencies remained the same for A4. However, high-light acclimated Fq'/Fm' levels decreased in both symbionts, but only when measured using the 615 or 625 nm excitation wavelengths. Non-photochemical quenching within the antennae bed was downregulated under high light acclimation in the A4 symbiont, but only when measured using the 505 and 530 nm excitation wavelengths. Such changes in Fq'/Fm' and antennae bed quenching highlight the benefits of spectrally resolved photochemical measurements. Additionally, the utilization of Arduino and Bitscope hardware exemplifies the potential of open source development platforms for construction of highly customizable instrumentation for photosynthetic research. © © 2017 Hoadley and Warner.","School of Marine Science and Policy, University of Delaware, Lewes, DE, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85035029639&doi=10.3389%2ffmars.2017.00365&partnerID=40&md5=e96e920a40b319830ccd38894102e4f6,cited By 5,365,10.3389/fmars.2017.00365,NOV,4,2017,Frontiers in Marine Science,Use of open source hardware and software platforms to quantify spectrally dependent differences in photochemical efficiency and functional absorption cross section within the dinoflagellate symbiodinium spp,"Hoadley, K.D. and Warner, M.E.",article,Hoadley2017,,,Absorbance;  Coral photobiology;  Light acclimation;  Multispectral fluorometer;  Open source,,,,

The AC power meter, provided as open hardware, is designed using the same micro controller as the Arduino UNO1 with an In-system Programming (ISP) interface, thus allowing the user to change the firmware to match their particular use case using Arduino libraries or standard C language. The suggested design is compatible with the Raspberry Pi 32, making it a suitable real-time measurement accessory for the single board computer. The platform features an 8 channel simultaneous sampling Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) which allows a high fidelity sampling without time offsets. Depending on how the user decides to combine current transformers (CTs) and AC-AC voltage adapters for the input channels, circuit breakers or appliances can be measured in either one phase or three phases. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050501667&doi=10.1145%2f3137133.3141441&partnerID=40&md5=27f58829ad08e88279ac4a553607c411,cited By 3,,10.1145/3137133.3141441,,2017-January,2017,BuildSys 2017 - Proceedings of the 4th ACM International Conference on Systems for Energy-Efficient Built Environments,Demo abstract: Design and implementation of a low-cost arduino-based high-frequency AC waveform meter board for the raspberry Pi,"Quintana, M. and Lange, H. and Bergés, M.",conference,Quintana2017,,"AC-AC power converters;  Analog to digital conversion;  C (programming language);  Electric circuit breakers;  Electric transformers;  Firmware;  Indium compounds, Analog to digital converters;  Design and implementations;  High frequency AC;  In-system programming;  Real time measurements;  Simultaneous Sampling;  Single board computers;  Voltage and current waveforms, Energy efficiency",,,9781450354769,Eskicioglu R.,

In this study, we describe an imaging system that integrates low-cost and open-source hardware, software and genetic resources. The multi-fluorescence imaging system consists of readily available 470 nm LEDs, a Raspberry Pi camera and a set of filters made with low cost acrylics. This device allows imaging in scales ranging from single colonies to entire plates. We developed a set of genetic components (e.g. promoters, coding sequences, terminators) and vectors following the standard framework of Golden Gate, which allowed the fabrication of genetic constructs in a combinatorial, low cost and robust manner. In order to provide simultaneous imaging of multiple wavelength signals, we screened a series of long stokes shift fluorescent proteins that could be combined with cyan/green fluorescent proteins. We found CyOFP1, mBeRFP and sfGFP to be the most compatible set for 3-channel fluorescent imaging. We developed open source Python code to operate the hardware to run time-lapse experiments with automated control of illumination and camera and a Python module to analyze data and extract meaningful biological information. To demonstrate the potential application of this integral system, we tested its performance on a diverse range of imaging assays often used in disciplines such as microbial ecology, microbiology and synthetic biology. We also assessed its potential use in a high school environment to teach biology, hardware design, optics, and programming. Together, these results demonstrate the successful integration of open source hardware, software, genetic resources and customizable manufacturing to obtain a powerful, low cost and robust system for education, scientific research and bioengineering.

Information and Communications Technology are called on to be one of the key players to get these cities to use smart devices and sensors (Internet of Things) to know at every moment what is happening within the city, in order to make decisions that will improve the management of resources. The proliferation of these “smart things” is producing significant deployment of networks in the city context. Most of these devices are proprietary solutions, which do not offer free access to the data they provide. Therefore, this prevents the interoperability and compatibility of these solutions in the current smart city developments. This paper presents how to embed an open sensorized platform for both hardware and software in the context of a smart city, more specifically in a university campus. For this integration, GIScience comes into play, where it offers different open standards that allow full control over “smart things” as an agile and interoperable way to achieve this. To test our system, we have deployed a network of different sensorized platforms inside the university campus, in order to monitor environmental phenomena. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Institute of New Imaging Technologies, Universitat Jaume I, Spain; Department BE-OP, European Organization for Nuclear Research, CERN Cedex, France",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85007012892&doi=10.1016%2fj.future.2016.11.005&partnerID=40&md5=efdea4c0a5a6a8145d937a5d3f767dbb,cited By 20,,10.1016/j.future.2016.11.005,,76,2017,Future Generation Computer Systems,Deployment of an open sensorized platform in a smart city context,"Trilles, S. and Calia, A. and Belmonte, Ó. and Torres-Sospedra, J. and Montoliu, R. and Huerta, J.",article,Trilles2017221,FGCSE,"Hardware;  Internet of things, Environmental Monitoring;  GEOEvent;  GIScience;  Open hardware;  Smart cities, Information management",Environmental monitoring;  GEOEvent;  GIScience;  Internet of Things;  Open-hardware;  Smart cities,221-233,,,

Further, the stimulator is equipped with per-chamber light and temperature sensors and a fan to monitor light intensity and to control temperature. An ON/OFF temperature control implemented on the embedded computer keeps the temperature from reaching levels that will induce the heat shock stress response in the flies. A custom enclosure was fabricated to house the electronic components of the stimulator. The enclosure provides a light-impermeable environment that allows air flow and lets users easily load and unload fly vials. Characterization results show that the fabricated stimulator can produce light at illuminances ranging from 0 to 16000 lux and power density levels from 0 to 7.2 mW/cm2 for blue light. For red light the maximum illuminance is 8000 lux which corresponds to a power density of 3.54 mW/cm2. The fans and the ON/OFF temperature control are able to keep the temperature inside the chambers below 28.17 °C. Experiments with white-eye male flies were performed to assess the ability of the fabricated simulator to induce blue light-dependent retinal degeneration. Retinal degeneration is observed in flies exposed to 8 h of blue light at 7949 lux. Flies in a control experiment with no light exposure show no retinal degeneration. Flies exposed to red light for the similar duration and light intensity (8 h and 7994 lux) do not show retinal degeneration either. Hence, the fabricated stimulator can be used to create environmental ocular stress using blue light. © 2017 The Authors","Department of Biochemistry, Purdue University, 175 South University Street, West Lafayette, IN, United States; School of Engineering Technology, Purdue University, 401 North Grant Street, West Lafayette, IN, United States; Department of Biological Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, United States; Purdue Center for Cancer Research, 201 South University Street, West Lafayette, IN, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85037867638&doi=10.1016%2fj.ohx.2017.07.001&partnerID=40&md5=933a0812ece9472a544175e163053d66,cited By 3,,10.1016/j.ohx.2017.07.001,,2,2017,HardwareX,A programmable optical stimulator for the Drosophila eye,"Chen, X. and Leon-Salas, W.D. and Zigon, T. and Ready, D.F. and Weake, V.M.",article,Chen201713,,"Enclosures;  Fabrication;  Heating;  Light emitting diodes;  Temperature control, Drosophila;  Embedded computers;  Open hardware;  Optical stimulation;  Rhodopsin, Ophthalmology",Drosophila;  Embedded computers;  Light-emitting diodes;  Open hardware;  Optical stimulation;  Rhodopsin,13-33,,,

As such, distributing these sensors across a robot's body could be beneficial for operation in human environments. We present a stretchable fabric-based skin with force and thermal sensors that is suitable for covering areas of a robot's body, including curved surfaces. It also adds a layer of compliance that conforms to manipulated objects, improving thermal sensing. Our open hardware design addresses thermal sensing challenges, such as the time to heat the sensors, the efficiency of sensing, and the distribution of sensors across the skin. It incorporates small self-heated temperature sensors on the surface of the skin that directly make contact with objects, improving the sensors’ response times. Our approach seeks to fully cover the robot's body with large force sensors, but treats temperature sensors as small, point-like sensors sparsely distributed across the skin. We present a mathematical model to help predict how many of these point-like temperature sensors should be used in order to increase the likelihood of them making contact with an object. To evaluate our design, we conducted tests in which a robot arm used a cylindrical end effector covered with skin to slide objects and press on objects made from four different materials. After assessing the safety of our design, we also had the robot make contact with the forearms and clothed shoulders of 10 human participants. With 2.0 s of contact, the actively-heated temperature sensors enabled binary classification accuracy over 90% for the majority of material pairs. The system could more rapidly distinguish between materials with large differences in their thermal effusivities (e.g., 90% accuracy for pine wood vs. aluminum with 0.5 s of contact). For discrimination between humans vs. the four materials, the skin's force and thermal sensing modalities achieved 93% classification accuracy with 0.5 s of contact. Overall, our results suggest that our skin design could enable robots to recognize contact with distinct task-relevant materials and humans while performing manipulation tasks in human environments. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Healthcare Robotics Lab, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032862268&doi=10.1016%2fj.robot.2017.06.008&partnerID=40&md5=142dd38e08848d527cc0dcd7fa942558,cited By 7,,10.1016/j.robot.2017.06.008,,96,2017,Robotics and Autonomous Systems,A force and thermal sensing skin for robots in human environments,"Wade, J. and Bhattacharjee, T. and Williams, R.D. and Kemp, C.C.",article,Wade20171,RASOE,"End effectors;  Robots;  Skin;  Temperature sensors, Binary classification;  Classification accuracy;  Force;  Manipulated objects;  Manipulation task;  Multi-modal;  Tactile;  Thermal, Machine design",Force;  Multimodal;  Robot;  Skin;  Tactile;  Thermal,1-14,,,

Open source scientific hardware enables custom experimentation, laboratory control, rapid upgrading, transparent maintenance, and lower costs in general. To aid in this trend, this study describes the development, design, assembly, and operation of a 3-D printable open source desktop nutating mixer, which provides a fixed 20° platform tilt angle for a gentle three-dimensional (gyrating) agitation of chemical or biological samples (e.g., DNA or blood samples) without foam formation. The custom components for the nutating mixer are designed using open source FreeCAD software to enable customization. All of the non-readily available components can be fabricated with a low-cost RepRap 3-D printer using an open source software tool chain from common thermoplastics. All of the designs are open sourced and can be configured to add more functionality to the equipment in the future. It is relatively easy to assemble and is accessible to both the science education of younger students as well as state-of-the-art research laboratories. Overall, the open source nutating mixer can be fabricated with US $ 37 in parts, which is 1/10th of the cost of proprietary nutating mixers with similar capabilities.

Recently, drowsy monitoring system has been actively studied for prediction system based machine learning. However, the challenges of automotive real-time constraints and flexibility should be taken into consideration against a large amount of heterogeneous data from vehicle network and other device. To solve this problem, we propose drowsy monitoring system based machine learning using GS1 standard. First, vehicle motion data is defined and modeled using the GS1 standard language for drowsy predict. Second, we propose an optimal algorithm selection and detail architecture for automotive real-time environments through machine learning algorithms (KNN, Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression) and deep learning algorithms (RNN-LSTM). Finally, we describe system-wide integration and implementation through the open source hardware Raspberry Pi and the machine learning SW framework.

Softw.,English,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"The chip industry faces two key challenges today -The impending end of Moore's Law and the rising costs of chip design and verification (millions of dollars today). Heterogeneous IPs - cores and domain-specific accelerators -Are a promising answer to the first challenge, enabling performance and energy benefits no longer provided by technology scaling. IP-reuse with plug-And-play designs can help with the second challenge, amortizing NRE costs tremendously. A key requirement in a heterogeneous IP-based plug-And-play SoC environment is an interconnection fabric to connect these IPs together. This fabric needs to be scalable - low latency, low energy and low area -And yet be flexible/parametrizable for use across designs. The key scalability challenge in any Network-on-Chip (NoC) today is that the latency increases proportional to the number of hops. In this work, we present a NoC generator called OpenSMART, which generates low-latency NoCs based on SMART1. SMART is a recently proposed NoC microarchitecture that enables multihop on-chip traversals within a single cycle, removing the dependence of latency on hops. SMART leverages wire delay of the underlying repeated wires, and augments each router with the ability to request and setup bypass paths. OpenSMART takes SMART from a NoC optimization to a design methodology for SoCs, enabling users to generate verified RTL for a class of userspecified network configurations, such as network size, topology, routing algorithm, number of VCs/buffers, router pipeline stages, and so on. OpenSMART also provides the ability to generate any heterogeneous topology with low and high-radix routers and optimized single-stage pipelines, leveraging fast logic delays in technology nodes today.

Among all pollutants, fine particulate matters (PM2.5) directly related to various serious health concerns, e.g., lung cancer, premature death, asthma, and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. To enhance the quality of urban living, sensors are deployed to create smart cities. In this paper, we present a participatory urban sensing framework for PM2.5 monitoring with more than 2500 devices deployed in Taiwan and 29 other countries. It is one of the largest deployment project for PM2.5 monitor in the world as we know until May 2017. The key feature of the framework is its open system architecture, which is based on the principles of open hardware, open source software, and open data. To facilitate the deployment of the framework, we investigate the accuracy issue of low-cost particle sensors with a comprehensive set of comparison evaluations to identify the most reliable sensor. By working closely with government authorities, industry partners, and maker communities, we can construct an effective eco-system for participatory urban sensing of PM2.5 particles. Based on our deployment achievements to date, we provide a number of data services to improve environmental awareness, trigger on-demand responses, and assist future government policymaking. The proposed framework is highly scalable and sustainable with the potential to facilitate the Internet of Things, smart cities, and citizen science in the future. © 2013 IEEE.","Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei, Taiwan; Research Center of Environmental Changes, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85023185030&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2017.2723919&partnerID=40&md5=ae7a4b94de4a663a81199bb5ff1341b3,cited By 48,7970115,10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2723919,,5,2017,IEEE Access,An Open Framework for Participatory PM2.5 Monitoring in Smart Cities,"Chen, L.-J. and Ho, Y.-H. and Lee, H.-C. and Wu, H.-C. and Liu, H.-M. and Hsieh, H.-H. and Huang, Y.-T. and Lung, S.-C.C.",article,Chen201714441,,"Air pollution;  Computer hardware;  Diseases;  Hardware;  Monitoring;  Open source software;  Pollution;  Sensors;  Smart city;  Software engineering, Atmospheric model;  Environmental awareness;  Fine particulate matter;  Government authorities;  Lungs;  Number of datum;  Open system architecture;  Particle sensors, Open systems",Air pollution;  crowdsourcing;  environmental monitoring;  Internet of Things,14441-14454,,,

The relative complexity of adaptive control schemes and algorithms and the computational load that they impose have prevented until recently their practical implementation into the industrial servo systems.

The current work has an immediate application in solving the simultaneous localization and mapping problem which is one of the challenging problems in the field of robotics. In this work, a set of RF sensors utilizing the ZigBee protocol are placed in an indoor environment and a base RF sensor is mounted within a rotating parabolic reflector on a mobile robot. The proposed range and bearing approximation framework works in two cascaded phases. In the first phase, the base RF sensor sends an RF signal to all other RF sensors within its operating range. These RF sensors then respond to the base RF module where ZigBee packets are parsed to store raw data for approximating range. In the second phase, a stepper motor is employed to rotate the parabolic reflector and the base RF sensor mounted on the robot.

Geographically distributed open hardware communities often conduct user feedback and peer critique sessions via video conference. However, people have difficulty using current video conferencing tools to demonstrate and critique physical designs. To examine the challenges of remote critique, we conducted an observational lab study in which participants critiqued pairs of physical prototypes (prosthetic hands) for a face-to-face or remote collaborator. In both conditions, participants' material experiences were an important part of their critique, however their attention was divided between interacting with the prototype and finding strategies to communicate 'invisible' features. Based on our findings, we propose design implications for remote collaboration tools that support the sharing of material experiences and prototype critique.

These plants face several technical problems and the inspection of components such as absorber tubes in parabolic trough concentrators (PTC), which are widely deployed, is necessary to guarantee plant efficiency. This article presents a system for real-time industrial inspection of CSP plants using low-cost, open-source components in conjunction with a thermographic sensor and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The system, available in open-source hardware and software, is designed to be employed independently of the type of device used for inspection (laptop, smartphone, tablet or smartglasses) and its operating system. Several UAV flight missions were programmed as follows: flight altitudes at 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 m above ground level; and three cruising speeds: 5, 7 and 10 m/s. These settings were chosen and analyzed in order to optimize inspection time. The results indicate that it is possible to perform inspections by an UAV in real time at CSP plants as a means of detecting anomalous absorber tubes and improving the effectiveness of methodologies currently being utilized. Moreover, aside from thermographic sensors, this contribution can be applied to other sensors and can be used in a broad range of applications where real-time georeferenced data visualization is necessary. © 2017 by the authors.

Closed-loop experiments, in which causal interventions are conditioned on the state of the system under investigation, have become increasingly common in neuroscience. Such experiments can have a high degree of explanatory power, but they require a precise implementation that can be difficult to replicate across laboratories. We sought to overcome this limitation by building open-source software that makes it easier to develop and share algorithms for closed-loop control. Approach. We created the Open Ephys GUI, an open-source platform for multichannel electrophysiology experiments. In addition to the standard 'open-loop' visualization and recording functionality, the GUI also includes modules for delivering feedback in response to events detected in the incoming data stream. Importantly, these modules can be built and shared as plugins, which makes it possible for users to extend the functionality of the GUI through a simple API, without having to understand the inner workings of the entire application. Main results. In combination with low-cost, open-source hardware for amplifying and digitizing neural signals, the GUI has been used for closed-loop experiments that perturb the hippocampal theta rhythm in a phase-specific manner. Significance. The Open Ephys GUI is the first widely used application for multichannel electrophysiology that leverages a plugin-based workflow. We hope that it will lower the barrier to entry for electrophysiologists who wish to incorporate real-time feedback into their research. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Allen Institute for Brain Science, 615 Westlake Ave N, Seattle, WA  98109, United States; Universitat Politècnica de València, Camí de Vera s/n, València, 46022, Spain; Georgia Institute of Technology, North Ave NW, Atlanta, GA  30332, United States; Zaporizhzhya State Engineering Academy, Sobornyi Ave, 226, Zaporizhia, Zaporiz'ka oblast, 69006, Ukraine; Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA  02139, United States; Instituto de Neurociencias CSIC-UMH, Avenida Santiago Ramon y Cajal, s/n, Sant Joan d'Alacant, Alicante, 03550, Spain",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020092311&doi=10.1088%2f1741-2552%2faa5eea&partnerID=40&md5=5cbefd9e0be08bc9978ac2a81db4cf26,cited By 50,045003,10.1088/1741-2552/aa5eea,4,14,2017,Journal of Neural Engineering,"Open Ephys: An open-source, plugin-based platform for multichannel electrophysiology","Siegle, J.H. and López, A.C. and Patel, Y.A. and Abramov, K. and Ohayon, S. and Voigts, J.",article,Siegle2017,,"Application programming interfaces (API);  Computer software;  Data visualization;  Electrophysiology;  Feedback;  Graphical user interfaces;  Neurology;  Open systems, Causal intervention;  Closed loops;  Closed-loop control;  Closed-loop experiments;  Open source platforms;  Open sources;  Open-source hardwares;  Real-time feedback, Open source software, algorithm;  Article;  electrophysiology;  hippocampus theta rhythm;  human;  information processing;  nervous system electrophysiology;  neurofeedback;  nonhuman;  priority journal;  signal processing;  software;  computer interface;  devices;  electrophysiology;  equipment design;  hippocampus;  neuroscience;  physiology;  procedures;  software design, Algorithms;  Electrophysiological Phenomena;  Equipment Design;  Hippocampus;  Humans;  Neurosciences;  Software Design;  User-Computer Interface",closed loop;  electrophysiology;  open source;  software,,,,

ROACH is an open-source hardware and software platform featuring a large Xilinx Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), Power PC processor, several 10 GB Ethernet SFP+ interfaces, and a collection of daughter boards for analog signal generation and acquisition. The combination of a ROACH board, ADC/DAC conversion daughter boards, and hardware for RF mixing allows for the generation and capture of multiple RF tones for reading out microwave multiplexed X-ray TES microcalorimeters. The FPGA is used to generate multiple tones in base band, from 10 MHz to 250 MHz, which are subsequently mixed to RF in the multiple GHz range and sent through the microwave multiplexer. The tones are generated in the FPGA by storing a large lookup table in Quad Data Rate SRAM modules and playing out the waveform to a DAC board. Once the signal has been modulated to RF, passed through the microwave multiplexer, and has been modulated back to base band, the signal is digitized by an ADC board. The tones are modulated to 0 Hz by using a FPGA circuit consisting of a polyphase filter bank, several Xilinx FFT blocks, Xilinx CORDIC blocks (for converting to magnitude and phase), and special phase accumulator circuit for mixing to exactly 0 Hz. Upwards of 256 channels can be simultaneously captured and written into a bank of 256 First-In-First-Out (FIFO) memories, with each FIFO corresponding to a channel. Individual channel data can be further processed in the FPGA before being streamed through a 10 GB Ethernet fiber-optic interface to a Linux system. The Linux system runs software written in Python and QT C++ for controlling the ROACH system, capturing data, and processing data. © 2017 IEEE.","Argonne National Laboratory, Chicago, IL  60439, United States; Northwestern University, Evanston, IL  60208, United States; National Institute of Standards and Technology, Boulder, CO  80305, United States; University of Colorado, Boulder, CO  80309, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014891308&doi=10.1109%2fTASC.2017.2650903&partnerID=40&md5=9e87ce88f0c4ec524c2a33bb83149c25,cited By 4,7822950,10.1109/TASC.2017.2650903,4,27,2017,IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity,Development of ROACH Firmware for Microwave Multiplexed X-Ray TES Microcalorimeters,"Madden, T.J. and Cecil, T.W. and Gades, L.M. and Quaranta, O. and Yan, D. and Miceli, A. and Becker, D.T. and Bennett, D.A. and Hays-Wehle, J.P. and Hilton, G.C. and Gard, J.D. and Mates, J.A.B. and Reintsema, C.D. and Schmidt, D.R. and Swetz, D.S. and Vale, L.R. and Ullom, J.N.",article,Madden2017,ITASE,"C++ (programming language);  Calorimeters;  Computer operating systems;  Computer programming;  Computer software;  Data handling;  Ethernet;  Firmware;  Hardware;  Linux;  Microwaves;  Mixing;  Multiplexing;  Multiplexing equipment;  Open source software;  Open systems;  Signal processing;  Static random access storage;  Table lookup;  Tellurium, Fiber-optic interfaces;  First in first outs;  Micro-calorimeters;  Open-source hardwares;  Phase accumulators;  Polyphase filter banks;  ROACH;  Superconducting detector, Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)",firmware;  FPGA;  microwave multiplexing;  ROACH;  superconducting detectors;  superconducting microcalorimeters;  TES,,,,

With few exceptions, such test systems are discontinuous. They require exposure of the biological test material in small units, such as multiwell plates, during prolonged incubation periods, and do not allow online read-outs. It is mostly due to these shortcomings that applications in continuous monitoring of, e.g., drinking or surface water quality are largely missing. We propose the use of pipetting robots that can be used to automatically exchange samples in multiwell plates with fresh samples in a semi-static manner, as a potential solution to overcome these limitations. In this study, we developed a simple and low-cost, versatile pipetting robot constructed partly using open-source hardware that has a small footprint and can be used for online monitoring of water quality by means of an automated whole-organism bioassay. We tested its precision in automated 2-fold dilution series and used it for exposure of zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio)–a common model species in ecotoxicology—to cadmium chloride and permethrin. We found that, compared to conventional static or semi-static exposure scenarios, effects of the two chemicals in zebrafish embryos generally occurred at lower concentrations, and analytically verified that the increased frequency of media exchange resulted in a greater availability of the chemical. In combination with advanced detection systems this custom-made pipetting robot has the potential to become a valuable tool in future monitoring strategies for drinking and surface water. © 2017 Steffens et al.

The proposed system consists of a primary and secondary sub-system which work in tandem to recognize static gestures signed by the user. Each of the sub-systems consists of a sensory glove, embedded with custom made, low-cost flex and contact sensors interfaced with a ATMega328 microcontroller. The two sub-systems are wirelessly inter-connected through a pair of TI's CC2541 Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) modules. The system recognizes gestures with the help of a Dual-mode Intelligent Agent (DIA) which operates in Identification Mode (IM) and intelligently switches to Enhanced Identification Mode (EIM) when the gesture fails to get recognized in IM. The EIM incorporates a Bit Stream Error Elimination (BSEE) algorithm which enhances the gesture recognition accuracy without the addition of any external hardware. The performance of the system was evaluated using a data set comprising of 196 static gestures from eight globally used sign languages. The system efficiency was found to be 80.06% in IM and was enhanced to 93.16% in EIM.

Workshops, PerCom Workshops",English,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"Infrastructure monitoring applications currently lack a cost-effective and reliable solution for supporting the last communication hop for low-power devices. The use of cellular infrastructure requires contracts and complex radios that are often too power hungry and cost prohibitive for sensing applications that require just a few bits of data each day. New low-power, sub-GHz, long-range radios are an ideal technology to help fill this communication void by providing access points that are able to cover multiple kilometers of urban space with thousands of end-point devices. These new Low-Power Wide-Area Networking (LPWAN) platforms provide a cost-effective and highly deployable option that could piggyback off of existing public and private wireless networks (WiFi, Cellular, etc). In this paper, we present OpenChirp, a prototype end-to-end LPWAN architecture built using LoRa Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN) with the goal of simplifying the design and deployment of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices across wide areas like campuses and cities. We present a software architecture that exposes an application layer allowing users to register devices, describe transducer properties, transfer data and retrieve historical values. We define a service model on top of LoRaWAN that acts as a session layer to provide basic encoding and syntax to raw data streams. At the device-level, we introduce and benchmark an open-source hardware platform that uses Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) to help provision LoRa clients that can be extended with custom transducers. We evaluate the system in terms of end-node energy consumption, radio penetration into buildings as well as coverage provided by a network currently deployed at Carnegie Mellon University. © 2017 IEEE.","Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, United States; Instituto Superior Técnico, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal; Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Carnegie Mellon University - Silicon Valley, Mountain View, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020003908&doi=10.1109%2fPERCOMW.2017.7917625&partnerID=40&md5=d5cc1a709fae299fdef674a9dd9f91cd,cited By 14,7917625,10.1109/PERCOMW.2017.7917625,,,2017,"2017 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops, PerCom Workshops 2017",OpenChirp: A Low-Power Wide-Area Networking architecture,"Dongare, A. and Hesling, C. and Bhatia, K. and Balanuta, A. and Pereira, R.L. and Iannucci, B. and Rowe, A.",conference,Dongare2017569,,"Application programs;  Cost effectiveness;  Costs;  Energy utilization;  Internet of things;  Network architecture;  Open source software;  Open systems;  Transducers;  Ubiquitous computing;  Wi-Fi;  Wide area networks, Bluetooth low energies (BLE);  Carnegie Mellon University;  Cellular infrastructure;  Infrastructure monitoring;  Internet of Things (IOT);  Networking architecture;  Open-source hardwares;  Sensing applications, Low power electronics",,569-574,9781509043385,,

Given that advent of Internet of Things (IoT) era due to mobile technology progressions, the future needs a sorting method that is available on any environment, such as not only high performance systems like servers but also low computational performance machines like embedded systems. In this paper, we present an FPGA-based sorting accelerator combining Sorting Network and Merge Sorter Tree, which is customizable by means of tuning design parameters. The proposed FPGA accelerator sorts data sent from a host PC via the PCIe bus, and sends back the fully sorted data sequence to it. We also present a detailed analytical model that accurately estimates the sorting performance. Due to these characteristics, designers can know how fast a developed sorting hardware is in advance and can implement the best one to fulfill the cost and performance constraints. Our experiments show that the proposed hardware achieves up to 19.5x sorting performance, compared with Intel Core i7-3770K operating at 3.50GHz, when sorting 256M 32-bits integer elements. However, this result is limited because of insufficient memory bandwidth. To overcome this problem, we propose a data compression mechanism and the experimental result shows that the sorting hardware with it achieves almost 90% of the estimated performance, while the hardware without it does about 60%. In order to allow every designer to easily and freely use this accelerator, the RTL source code is released as open-source hardware. © 2017 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.","University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba-shi, 305-3577, Japan; Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, 152-8552, Japan",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018942266&doi=10.1587%2ftransinf.2016EDP7383&partnerID=40&md5=26097ffda059444d4fb9a32735fa7d07,cited By 4,,10.1587/transinf.2016EDP7383,5,E100D,2017,IEICE Transactions on Information and Systems,A high performance FPGA-based sorting accelerator with a data compression mechanism,"Kobayashi, R. and Kise, K.",article,Kobayashi20171003,ITISE,"Acceleration;  Computer hardware;  Data compression;  Embedded systems;  Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA);  Hardware;  Image processing;  Internet of things;  Open source software;  Open systems;  Technology transfer, Computational performance;  Hardware accelerators;  High performance systems;  Internet of Things (IOT);  Open sources;  Open-source hardwares;  Performance constraints;  Tuning design parameters, Sorting",Data compression;  Hardware accelerator;  Open source;  Sorting,1003-1015,,,

However, entering this field of research is difficult since such an implant requires components from many different areas of technology. Since the complete avoidance of wires is important due to the risk of infections and other long-term problems, means for wirelessly transmitting data and energy are a necessity which adds to the requirements. In recent literature, many high-tech components for such implants are presented with remarkable properties. However, these components are typically not freely available for such a system.

Changing the mixing angle is fast and convenient and requires no tools. This device is battery powered and can be easily transported to operate in various locations in a lab including desktops, benches, clean hoods, chemical hoods, cold rooms, glove boxes, incubators or biological hoods.

We present in detail the design of our hardware components, while also providing insights to the overall system design and a first set of results on their operation. The presented hardware components are utilized as the core hardware devices for GAIA, an EU research project aimed at the educational community. As our system has been deployed and tested in several public school buildings in Greece, we also report on its validation. © 2017","Computer Technology Institute and Press “Diophantus”, Patras, Greece; Universita Di Roma “La Sapienza”, Rome, Italy",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029510363&doi=10.1016%2fj.ohx.2017.02.002&partnerID=40&md5=e8c93ba2cd62b9ef640aef1d8b124774,cited By 46,,10.1016/j.ohx.2017.02.002,,1,2017,HardwareX,Open source IoT meter devices for smart and energy-efficient school buildings,"Pocero, L. and Amaxilatis, D. and Mylonas, G. and Chatzigiannakis, I.",article,Pocero201754,,"Internet of things;  Open source software;  Open systems;  School buildings;  Sustainable development, Educational buildings;  Educational community;  Environmental Monitoring;  IoT deployment;  Monitoring and management;  Open-source hardwares;  Real time monitoring;  Validation, Energy efficiency",Energy efficiency;  Environmental monitoring;  IoT deployment;  Open source hardware and software;  Smart school building;  Validation,54-67,,,

Another interesting property of the proposed antenna is its simplicity of construction. The antenna has been modelled using the moment method. A prototype resonant at 2.4 GHz has been built and we have measured its impedance in this spectral region. The radiation pattern and the gain at resonance have also been characterized and the device has been shown to provide 6.31 dBi gain.

One way to support stronger end users' engagement with such complex technologies is by involving them in the design process and, with the advent of Arduino prototyping platform, even in their making. While DIY practice offers the potential for stronger user engagement with physical artifacts, we know little about end users' DIY practice of making complex electronic technologies and their potential to ensure engagement with such devices. In this article, we report on interviews with 18 participants from two green communities who built and used an open source DIY energy monitor, with the aim to explore the end users DIY practices of making such complex electronic devices. Findings indicate four key qualities of DIY monitors: transparent modularity, open-endedness, heirloom, and disruptiveness, and how they contribute to more meaningful engagement with the DIY monitors, elevating them from the status of unremarkable objects to that of things. We conclude with three implications for design for supporting end user development of complex electronic DIY: designing transparent open hardware technologies, standardizing communication protocols for the current and future DIY of IoT, and deliberately calling for personal investment and labor in the assembling of DIY kits. © 2017 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

This fundamental shift however will require a transformation and redesign of the vehicle's technical architecture. Today, a vehicle's ADAS, communications, and entertainment features exist isolated in separate devices and systems and are purpose built, leading to duplicative functions, increased costs, and difficult control, management, maintenance, and upgrade of the system.

Not only will this gateway orchestrate the common devices and CMS as a collective unit, this open architecture will allow for scalable, flexible and easy development of 3rd party equipment, such as V2X, and new applications. New modules and/or software applications for additional features, repairs, and upgrades can be added later without changing the existing system.

Recording from dozens to hundreds of electrodes is today routine; novel means of manipulating the system in real time, through electrical stimulation, optogenetics or sensory manipulation are allowing us to decipher neural circuit function at an unparalleled rate. To contribute to the wide dissemination of such techniques, we present an open hardware project, High-Channel Count Electrophysiology (HiCCE), aiming to produce low-cost, high-channel count (≥128 channels) electrophysiology instrumentation capable of fast data acquisition rates, real-time processing and feedback capabilities. Our design is centered on an open standard, FPGA Mezzanine Card (FMC), which permits a varied choice of FPGA carrier architectures suited to different laboratory experimental needs. The HiCCE-128, a low-cost highperformance 128-channel data acquisition board for small voltage signals, is being introduced. It is a FMC module that can be operated from any FPGA carrier conforming to the FMC/VITA57 standard. This specialized board with a low input referred noise of about 3 μV is capable of acquiring 128 channels simultaneously at 31.25 kS/s per channel with 16 effective bits of resolution.

Then, we describe our answers to these problems, as we implemented them in the Thymio project: a mature mass-produced open-hardware robot, at a low price, with a multiage and gender-neutral feature set, and with a design promoting creativity, facilitating learning, and providing a wide range of interaction possibilities from built-in behaviors to text programming, passing through different visual programming environments. We highlight some neglected key issues that differentiate open-source hardware from open-source software, for instance the legal uncertainty of designing open hardware using professional computer-aided design (CAD) tools and the difficulty to distribute the development.

Open source systems have already revolutionized a number of industries by empowering end users to contribute to the products that they need and want and by fueling grass-roots development and continual improvement of projects in completely new areas. While there have been innumerable successes in software and electronics hardware, open mechanical hardware is taking longer to catch on. There are a number of likely reasons for this, including the complexity, expense, and time associated with fabricating mechanical components as well as the challenge and reliability of assembling the wide range of mechanical and electronic components required to produce a fully functional system. In comparison with open-source software efforts, open hardware has numerous additional practical challenges associated with dissemination and evolution of the product driven by end users. However, rapid fabrication technologies have improved to the point of being able to produce parts that are strong, robust, and precise enough for practical robotic systems, and the pricing of the systems and supplies have lowered to the point that many of these machines are available in fabrication facilities at most universities. © 1994-2011 IEEE.",,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85016625042&doi=10.1109%2fMRA.2016.2646068&partnerID=40&md5=c47da329b9eda6325c5a18d546d2f362,cited By 1,7886405,10.1109/MRA.2016.2646068,1,24,2017,IEEE Robotics and Automation Magazine,Open-Source and Widely Disseminated Robot Hardware [From the Guest Editors],"Dollar, A. and Mondada, F. and Rodriguez, A. and Metta, G.",article,Dollar201730,IRAME,,,30-31,,,

This “Do-It-Yourself” interface comprised a 1.0 m×0.25 mm segment of MTX-5 metallic column and a low-cost DC power supply. Thermal desorption modulation (TDM) was attained using a dual-stage heater-based modulator in a novel segmented-loop configuration. TDM was achieved by alternating analyte trapping and thermal desorption. Former process relied on analyte partition to sorbent phase, while latter explored direct resistive heating. Introduction of an intermediate delay segment between the two stages mitigated analyte breakthrough, improving peak symmetry and chromatographic efficiency. This feature was critical to acquire reliable GC×GC modulation using such simple heater-based device. The effects of important modulation variables on 2D separations were investigated, including TDM stage length, dimension of delay loop, and outlet pressure. Significant advances and limitations of proposed TDM strategy were carefully determined. Proposed GC×GC prototype by using an in-oven TDM modulator was successfully applied to a series of challenging matrices, including petroleum distillates, biodiesel, and essential oil. This open-hardware, cost-effective modulator was easy to install and operate, as it circumvented the need for sophisticated components (e.g. moving parts and cooling systems). Therefore, our modulator is a compelling alternative to existing GC×GC solutions to operate in resource-limited laboratories. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Laboratório Nacional de Nanotecnologia, Centro Nacional de Pesquisa em Energia e Materiais, Campinas, SP  13083-100, Brazil; Instituto de Química, Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Campinas, SP  13083-970, Brazil; Nova Analítica Importação Exportação LTDA, São Paulo, SP  04131-000, Brazil",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85003704147&doi=10.1016%2fj.talanta.2016.12.005&partnerID=40&md5=9d762490994a0f202f3b8db770a443b2,cited By 6,,10.1016/j.talanta.2016.12.005,,164,2017,Talanta,Thermal desorption modulation for comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography using a simple and inexpensive segmented-loop fluidic interface,"Mucédola, V. and Vieira, L.C.S. and Pierone, D. and Gobbi, A.L. and Poppi, R.J. and Hantao, L.W.",article,Mucédola2017470,TLNTA,"Cooling systems;  Cost effectiveness;  Crude oil;  Essential oils;  Mass spectrometry;  Modulation;  Petroleum distillates;  Phase interfaces;  Smoke detectors;  Thermal desorption;  Volatile organic compounds, Chemical education;  Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography;  DC power supplies;  Fluidic interface;  Loop configuration;  Modulation strategy;  Multidimensional gas chromatography;  Resistive heating, Gas chromatography",Chemical education;  Mass spectrometry;  Multidimensional gas chromatography;  Petroleum;  Poly(dimethylsiloxane);  Volatile organic compound,470-476,,,

First, a compact, mobile system was built using an infrared gas analyzer combined with open-source hardware to control, georeference, and log measurements of CO2 mixing ratios on vehicles (car, bicycles). Second, two measurement campaigns, one in summer and one in winter (heating season) were carried out. Five mobile sensors were deployed within a 1×12.7 km transect across the city of Vancouver, BC, Canada. The sensors were operated for 3.5 h on pre-defined routes to map CO2 mixing ratios at street level, which were then averaged to 100×100m grid cells. The averaged CO2 mixing ratios of all grids in the study area were 417.9 ppm in summer and 442.5 ppm in winter. In both campaigns, mixing ratios were highest in the grid cells of the downtown core and along arterial roads and lowest in parks and well vegetated residential areas. Third, an aerodynamic resistance approach to calculating emissions was used to derive CO2 emissions from the gridded CO2 mixing ratio measurements in conjunction with mixing ratios and fluxes collected from a 28m tall eddycovariance tower located within the study area. These measured emissions showed a range of -12 to 226CO2 ha-1 h-1 in summer and of -14 to 163 kgCO2 ha-1 h-1 in winter, with an average of 35.1 kgCO2 ha-1 h-1 (summer) and 25.9 kgCO2 ha-1 h-1 (winter). Fourth, an independent emissions inventory was developed for the study area using buildings energy simulations from a previous study and routinely available traffic counts. The emissions inventory for the same area averaged to 22.06 kgCO2 ha-1 h-1 (summer) and 28.76 kgCO2 ha-1 h-1 (winter) and was used to compare against the measured emissions from the mobile sensor network. The comparison on a grid-by-grid basis showed linearity between CO2 mixing ratios and the emissions inventory (R2 = 0:53 in summer and R2 = 0:47 in winter). Also, 87% (summer) and 94% (winter) of measured grid cells show a difference within ±1 order of magnitude, and 49% (summer) and 69% (winter) show an error of less than a factor 2. Although associated with considerable errors at the individual grid cell level, the study demonstrates a promising method of using a network of mobile sensors and an aerodynamic resistance approach to rapidly map greenhouse gases at high spatial resolution across cities. The method could be improved by longer measurements and a refined calculation of the aerodynamic resistance. © Author(s) 2017.","Department of Geography, Atmospheric Science Program, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada; Biometeorology Group, Faculty of Land and Food Systems, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014540009&doi=10.5194%2famt-10-645-2017&partnerID=40&md5=89a158e18e51cdcd84b355002926a66d,cited By 13,,10.5194/amt-10-645-2017,2,10,2017,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,A mobile sensor network to map carbon dioxide emissions in urban environments,"Lee, J.K. and Christen, A. and Ketler, R. and Nesic, Z.",article,Lee2017645,,"aerodynamics;  building;  carbon dioxide;  eddy covariance;  emission;  emission inventory;  energy use;  map;  mixing ratio;  monitoring system;  sensor;  spatial resolution;  transect;  urban atmosphere, British Columbia;  Canada;  Vancouver [British Columbia]",,645-665,,,

The usage of sensors and actuators of different nature and diverse interfaces (SPI, I2C, analogue, etc.) makes access to them from a network in a homogeneous and secure way more complex. A framework, including both software and hardware resources, is necessary to simplify and unify networked access to these devices. In this paper, a set of open-source software tools, specifically designed to cover the different issues concerning the access to sensors and actuators, and two proposed low-cost hardware architectures to operate with the abovementioned software tools are presented. They allow integrated and easy access to local or remote sensors and actuators. The software tools, integrated in the free authoring tool Easy Java and Javascript Simulations (EJS) solve the interaction issues between the subsystem that integrates sensors and actuators into the network, called convergence subsystem in this paper, and the Human Machine Interface (HMI)—this one designed using the intuitive graphical system of EJS—located on the user’s computer.

We adopted the Arch Max (ARM Cortex-M4-based open-source hardware) as an HIL simulator platform. Using the nested vectored interrupt controller (NVIC) mechanism of the Cortex-M4 core, we assigned three interrupts with different priorities to handle three parts of the HIL simulator. The model equation of the inverted pendulum system was solved in real-time using the Runge-Kutta method in a timer interrupt service routine. An input capture interrupt-based method was used to simulate the motor drive by converting the duty ratio of pulse width modulation (PWM) signals into the voltage level applied to a DC motor. To simulate incremental rotary encoders, which are two sensors for the inverted pendulum system, a timer interrupt-based quadrature pulse generation algorithm was presented and to generate the quadrature pulse more accurately, an error compensation method was also provided. Finally, animation functionality to give a visual indication of how the controller is progressing was implemented through Vpython. Through experiments, we illustrated that the proposed HIL simulator successfully simulates the real inverted pendulum and is useful for teaching students about designing a working controller through programming embedded devices. © ICROS 2017.","Department of Electrical Engineering, Inha University, South Korea",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85012285186&doi=10.5302%2fJ.ICROS.2017.17.0002&partnerID=40&md5=636a06c127bc68c3d923bf9f25fe7dde,cited By 6,,10.5302/J.ICROS.2017.17.0002,2,23,2017,"Journal of Institute of Control, Robotics and Systems",The implementation of a hardware-in-the-loop simulator for an inverted pendulum system using open-source hardware,"Choi, J.-S. and Lee, Y.-S.",article,Choi2017117,,"ARM processors;  Controllers;  DC motors;  Electric drives;  Embedded systems;  Error compensation;  Hardware;  Open source software;  Pendulums;  Pulse width modulation;  Runge Kutta methods;  Simulators;  Synthetic apertures;  Voltage control, Arm cortices;  Error compensation methods;  Hardware in the loop simulator;  Interrupt service routine;  Inverted pendulum;  Inverted pendulum system;  NVIC;  Open-source hardwares, Open systems",ARM Cortex-M4;  HIL simulator;  Inverted pendulum;  NVIC;  Open source hardware,117-125,,,

Open source models for tangible products are still in its infancy, and many studies are required to demonstrate its application to for-profit product development. It is an alluring question why entrepreneurs decide to use an open model to develop their products under risks and unknowns, such as infringement and community management. The goal of this paper is to investigate the motivations of entrepreneurs of open source hardware companies. The leaders and founders of twentythree companies were interviewed to understand their motivation and experiences in creating a company based on open source hardware. Based on these interviews, we generated a hierarchical framework to explain these motivations, where each level of the framework has been defined, explained and illustrated with representative quotes. The motivations of open source action are framed by two categories in the paper: 1) Intrinsic Motivation, which describes the motivations of an entrepreneur as an individual, who needs personal satisfaction, enjoyment as well as altruism and reciprocity; 2) Extrinsic Motivation, which describes motivations of an entrepreneur whose identity is as a for-profit company leader. © 2017 ASME.","Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85034741889&doi=10.1115%2fDETC2017-68195&partnerID=40&md5=d8bcfc723f085a5347d36148a74e3db9,cited By 3,68195,10.1115/DETC2017-68195,,1,2017,Proceedings of the ASME Design Engineering Technical Conference,Why open source? exploring the motivations of using an open model for hardware development,"Li, Z. and Seering, W. and Ramos, J.D. and Yang, M. and Wallace, D.R.",conference,Li2017,,"Computer hardware;  Design;  Hardware;  Motivation;  Open systems;  Profitability, Community management;  Extrinsic motivation;  Hardware development;  Intrinsic motivation;  Open sources;  Open-source hardwares;  Open-source model;  Tangible product, Open source software",Motivation;  Open design;  Open source,,9780791858110,,

Moreover, technical documentation and support for open hardware are scarce in comparison to expensive commercially distributed platforms. In this paper, we present a detailed process to implement embedded Linux and the real-time extension of Xenomai to two popular open embedded hardware, BeagleBone Black and i. MX6Q SABRELite. Also, we analyze the response time of real-time mechanisms and its performance for inter-task communication (ITC) between real-time tasks. Response time of real-time mechanisms is an important measure to predict the realtime performance of each platform. The performance evaluation is performed both in kernel space and user space using the metrics of jitter, to estimate the periodicity of the cyclic task, and execution time of three real-time mechanisms including semaphore, message queue, and message pipe.

This approach is refined here to develop a novel instrument capable of performing automated large-area four-point probe measurements. The designs for conversion of a RepRap 3-D printer to a 2-D open source four-point probe (OS4PP) measurement device are detailed for the mechanical and electrical systems. Free and open source software and firmware are developed to operate the tool. The OS4PP was validated against a wide range of discrete resistors and indium tin oxide (ITO) samples of different thicknesses both pre- and post-annealing. The OS4PP was then compared to two commercial proprietary systems. Results of resistors from 10 to 1 MΩ show errors of less than 1% for the OS4PP. The 3-D mapping of sheet resistance of ITO samples successfully demonstrated the automated capability to measure non-uniformities in large-area samples. The results indicate that all measured values are within the same order of magnitude when compared to two proprietary measurement systems. In conclusion, the OS4PP system, which costs less than 70% of manual proprietary systems, is comparable electrically while offering automated 100 micron positional accuracy for measuring sheet resistance over larger areas. © 2017 by the authors.","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI  49931, United States; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI  49931, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85013860771&doi=10.3390%2fma10020110&partnerID=40&md5=c832388a2796f66ff08cbef7dab20754,cited By 10,110,10.3390/ma10020110,2,10,2017,Materials,Open-source automated mapping four-point probe,"Chandra, H. and Allen, S.W. and Oberloier, S.W. and Bihari, N. and Gwamuri, J. and Pearce, J.M.",article,Chandra2017,,"Annealing;  Automation;  Electric conductivity;  Firmware;  Hardware;  Indium;  Mapping;  Open systems;  Printing machinery;  Printing presses;  Probes;  Resistors;  Sheet resistance;  Software engineering;  Tin;  Tin oxides, 3-D platform;  Four point probe;  Indium tin oxide;  Open-source hardwares;  Transparent conducting oxide, Open source software",3-D platform;  Conductivity;  Four-point probe;  Indium tin oxide;  ITO;  Libre hardware;  Open source hardware;  Sheet resistance;  TCO;  Transparent conducting oxide,,,,

Consequently, the risk of blades breakage by hitting the tower has increased. In order to prevent such incidents, this study proposes a deflection monitoring system that can be installed to already operating wind turbine's blades. The monitoring system is composed of an estimation algorithm to detect blade deflection and a wireless sensor network as a hardware equipment. As for the estimation method for blade deflection, a strain-based estimation algorithm and an objective function for optimal sensor arrangement are proposed. Strain-based estimation algorithm is using a linear correlation between strain and deflections, which can be expressed in a form of a transformation matrix. The objective function includes the terms of strain sensitivity and condition number of the transformation matrix between strain and deflection. In order to calculate the objective function, a simplified experimental model of the blade is constructed by interpolating the mode shape of a blade from modal testing. The interpolation method is effective considering a practical use to operating wind turbines' blades since it is not necessary to establish a finite element model of a blade. On the other hand, a sensor network with wireless connection with an open source hardware is developed. It is installed to a 300 W scale wind turbine and vibration of the blade on operation is investigated. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, 2-12-1 Ookayama, Meguro-ku, Tokyo, 152–8550, Japan; Department of Energy Science, Tokyo Institute of Technology, 2-12-1 Ookayama, Meguro-ku, Tokyo, 152–8550, Japan",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84973454863&doi=10.1016%2fj.ymssp.2016.05.011&partnerID=40&md5=4a48ab70223ee2aaca338f0ac9af6660,cited By 15,,10.1016/j.ymssp.2016.05.011,,82,2017,Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing,Feasibility study on a strain based deflection monitoring system for wind turbine blades,"Lee, K. and Aihara, A. and Puntsagdash, G. and Kawaguchi, T. and Sakamoto, H. and Okuma, M.",article,Lee2017117,MSSPE,"Deflection (structures);  Finite element method;  Hardware;  Interpolation;  Linear transformations;  Mathematical transformations;  Matrix algebra;  Modal analysis;  Monitoring;  Number theory;  Open systems;  Reconfigurable hardware;  Turbomachine blades;  Wind power;  Wind turbines;  Wireless sensor networks, Deflection monitoring;  Experimental modeling;  Interpolation method;  Open-source hardwares;  Strain monitoring;  Transformation matrices;  Vibration monitoring;  Wind turbine blades, Turbine components",Deflection monitoring;  Strain monitoring;  Vibration monitoring;  Wind energy;  Wind turbine blades,117-129,,,

Maker Education is based on knowledge, directed by creation, and is aimed at solving problems. This study, aimed at the curriculum of the Department of Information Management, expects to develop a systematic information Maker curriculum. This curriculum, combined with the 3D printing machine and Arduino open hardware configured with the STEM education framework, is designed to explore the impact of the introduction of Maker education to information curriculum of technical or vocational colleges on attitude differences and learning of STEM. Two courses, 3D model design and Arduino programming, are implemented, after the end of which, students’ achievements are evaluated. The result is that male still have higher interests in science, engineering and technology than women, but Maker curriculum is multifaceted and foundational so that many people can spend a little time in learning and use various skills to produce their own works.

Meas.,English,,20460546,Wit Press,,"The number of disposable molecular diagnostics tests in the IVD market has been growing rapidly and is bound to continue to grow in the near future. The internal complexity of these rapid tests increases with the complexity of the diagnostic assay implemented by them. Some assays require precise temperature control (±1°C–5°C) for an extended time (i.e. 15–60 minutes) for the reactions involved to run properly. Microheating components in them must meet strict criteria with respect to power consumption, physical size and cost. The proposed finite element model is intended to provide tools for in silico validation of device designs (geometries, structural materials), as well as to help in the interpretation of heat transfer processes inside the thermal system present in a molecular diagnostics device. The proposed model was developed for and validated with polyimide etched foil heating elements actively controlled via a mini-thermostat. The thermostat was designed for battery-based operation and implemented with open-source hardware (Arduino-compatible). Plastic test structures were created that emulated disposable Lab-on-a-Chip devices with microfluidic channels to hold liquid volumes on the scale of 0.1 mL. The experimental setup was demonstrated to maintain target temperatures over at least 30 minutes with at least ±1°C around the set point operated from batteries.

This modulo periodically stopped operation, requiring physical reset. In 2008 after an reset it stopped permanently. There weren't an spare module or a new one to buy - it was not commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) item. This work presents the developing of solution using a COTS industrial box PC, with open sources software components to provide serial communication, MODBUS TCP/IP server, system logger, besides the use of a Linux operational system and a free integrated development environment (IDE) for coding over the Java Open JDK - the Java open source development kit. We discuss the software architecture that permits synchronization between commands and data read beside error signaling; the implementation of an Arduino - open source hardware - simulator for the odorant system, that responds to commands and reads like a LEWA's unit; long time tests; and MODBUS TCP/IP server table. This solution for Suape Terminal were also adopted in 2013 for Santos Terminal in São Paulo, Brazil, where there are two others odorant units. The subject matter is extended to describe the solution for an issue observed in 2015, after some years in production - the pump running signaling, that was obtained by the read of odorant flow totalizer, for low flow rate, flaws with successive on and off indications. This problem conducted us to create an virtual flow rate indicator - the odorant's controller doesn't provides this signal -, using a Kalman Filter as estimator. We describe the problem symptoms, model construction and the computer solution through public-domain Java's math library - JAMA -, a kind of open source software package, created at National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for numeric linear algebra, to construct and manipulate matrices.

Surveying Geology Mining Ecology Manage., SGEM",English,,13142704,International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference,,"The monitoring of precipitation amounts plays an important role in the estimation of water balance as well as in the understanding of complex hydrological processes taking part in a catchment. High spatial and temporal variability of the rainfall could have a significant impact on the reliability of the performed hydrological analyses, which puts an increasing demand on sampling frequency and density of monitoring network. This is especially important in the case of small catchments, often with a small number or no monitoring stations at all, and local analyses where higher sampling frequency is a must. The relatively high cost of the commercial rain gauges, communication systems and post-processing software is the main reason why the collection of the precipitation amounts and the density of the monitoring network is still a challenge especially in developing countries. Latest advances in the low-cost open-source hardware and software sensor and electronics platforms together with the reduced costs and improved precision of 3D printers enable to design, develop and deploy custom low-cost measurement equipment. In this study a low-cost two-chamber tipping-bucket type rain gauge was designed and constructed. The electronics and the software of the gauge utilized an open-source Arduino platform, with the body of the gauge printed on a 3D printer using a fused filament fabrication technology, and an ABS thermoplastic polymer. The study describes the construction of the gauge and the function of the control software. However, the main goal of the study was to evaluate the precision and accuracy of the gauge in laboratory conditions and to calibrate a volume of water needed to tip the bucket from one position into another. In order to reduce the uncertainty the proposed laboratory experiment was conducted several times with various artificial rainfall intensities. The results showed a small variance in the values of the estimated volumes needed to tip the bucket as well as a clear positive relationship between these values and the rainfall intensities. © SGEM2017 All Rights Reserved.","Department of Land and Water Resources Management, Faculty of Civil Engineering, Slovak University of Technology, Slovakia",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032370272&doi=10.5593%2fsgem2017%2f31%2fS12.010&partnerID=40&md5=50d089aa449660d9e88bd6a1d99fd290,cited By 0,,10.5593/sgem2017/31/S12.010,31,17,2017,"International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference Surveying Geology and Mining Ecology Management, SGEM",Calibration of a low-cost 3D printed rain gauge utilizing an open-source arduino platform,"Valent, P. and Danáčová, M. and Výleta, R.",conference,Valent201773,,"3D printers;  ABS resins;  Catchments;  Costs;  Developing countries;  Importance sampling;  Open source software;  Open systems;  Printing presses;  Rain gages;  Runoff, 3-D printing;  Arduino;  Low costs;  Open sources;  Rain gauges, Rain",3D printing;  Arduino;  Low-cost monitoring equipment;  Open-source;  Rain gauge,73-80,9786197105001; 9786197105988; 9786197105995; 9786197408003; 9786197408010; 9786197408027; 9786197408034; 9786197408041; 9786197408058; 9786197408065; 9786197408072; 9786197408089; 9786197408096; 9786197408102; 9786197408119; 9786197408126; 9786197408133; 9786197408263,,

This paper aims to present a mobile platform, named “CARTON”, which transforms a smartphone into smart eyewear, following a do-it-yourself (DIY) approach. This platform is composed of three main components: a blueprint to build the hardware prototype with very simple materials and regular tools; a software development kit (SDK) to help with the development of new applications (e.g. augmented reality app); and, finally, a second SDK (ControlWear) to interact with mobile applications through a Smartwatch. Design/methodology/approach: User experiments were conducted, in which participants were asked to create, by themselves, the CARTON’s hardware part and perform usability tests with their own creation. A second round of experimentation was conducted to evaluate three different interaction modalities. Findings: Qualitative user feedback and quantitative results prove that CARTON is functional and feasible to anyone, without specific skills. The results also showed that ControlWear had the most positive results, compared with the other interaction modalities, and that user interaction preference would vary depending on the task.

Its urgency is due to the incorporation need of the numerous advances in mobile robotics to the area of the Assistive Technologies, and more specifically in the field of the so called Intelligent Wheelchairs (IW). In this paper we propose a common core for IWs based both on an open robotic platform and an open and a well extended software for robotics (ROS 'Robotic Operating System'). Such an IW core has got a distributed architecture whose processing nodes are linked through a CAN standard bus, which connects the low level control functions based on low cost and highly portable Cortex platforms. This paper describes also the autonomous navigation algorithm developed for the Intelligent Wheelchair by using an Extended Kalman Filter. In the chosen approach the absolute position of the IW (a mobile robot) is estimated using sensor fusion which combines data from two of the sensory systems included in the described open platform: the dead-reckoning system and a visual system based on QR landmarks located on the ceiling.

The efficient use of irrigation water is a key factor in coping with the food demands of an increasing world population and with the negative effects of climate change on water resource availability in many areas. In this complex context, it is important that farmers can rely on instruments and practices that enable a better management of water at the field scale, whatever the irrigation method they adopt. In this paper, we present an open-hardware device based on the Arduino technology that was developed to allow the continuous monitoring of soil water potential in the root zone for supporting irrigation scheduling at the field scale. The structure of the device is flexible and can be adapted to host different types of sensors. The results, obtained managing irrigation in a peach orchard, show that adoption of the device, together with a simple irrigation scheduling criterion, allowed a significant increase of water use efficiency without causing a reduction of the quantity and quality of crop production.

A central control computer that may be located on the vessel will call the multirotor to return to the research vessel's deck, which has continued to travel during the mission. A global positioning system (GPS) attached to a specialized platform on the deck of the boat provides the current position of the landing platform to the multirotor. Once the multirotor arrives above the perceived location of the landing platform, a downward facing camera mounted onto the vehicle is used to identify a fiducial element that is located on the platform. Using the fiducial element and known state of the vehicle, a visual surveying methodology is used to allow the vehicle to land accurately on the specialized landing platform. Unlike in most simulated or controlled environments, the deck of a vessel of opportunity can move unpredictably in 5 axes (roll, pitch, yaw, longitudinal, latitudinal) due to oceanic characteristics and weather conditions. At present, trained multirotor pilots are the standard for controlling air vehicles, especially under these conditions. The scalability, risk, and cost of using a highly skilled human pilot limits the usefulness of these platforms in large-scale research missions. We are aiming to minimize the cost and risk associated with these platforms by making them accessible to untrained pilots as well as allowing for use of multiple platforms at one time and allowing for easy design of missions that the vehicle can conduct semi-supervised. Beyond obvious physical changes to the multirotor, including reinforcing structures or waterproofing, the multirotor itself must behave adaptively and sensitively to its environment. Our multirotors are equipped with the open hardware/software PixHawk autopilot system, which automatically rejects small environmental disturbances and provides telemetry data, such as GPS position and state of the vehicle which we use for our controller. A camera mounted to a stabilizing gimbal at the nose of the multirotor captures HD images, and a wireless video link transmits these images and the data from the autopilot to the vessel-mounted computer for processing. Our landing platform is also equipped with a GPS and streams information to the central computer. Two types of error are calculated by the computer: macro-error and micro-error. Macro-error refers to the gross positions of the landing platform and the vehicle using GPS signals. Microerror refers to the position of the vehicle in reference to the position of the landing platform fiducial element. These are used to determine the appropriate thrust and directional vectors to give to the vehicle to make a successful landing. In Spring of 2016, we implemented successful fiducial identification using computer vision techniques which extract vehicle state and image information to determine relative location of the vehicle to a known fiducial. Using this, we have developed a preliminary controller which allows for station-keeping of the vehicle above an identified fiducial on the ground. In the Summer of 2016, we will continue to develop the control scheme for fiducial identification, vehicle navigation, and landing procedure through field tests at locations including Buzzards Bay, Lake Waban, and the Gloucester Harbor. Our technology depends upon, and is itself, open-source. This allows for rapid iteration of controller design and means that what we develop can be made widely available to the marineresearch community for immediate use or customization. By putting these powerful tools in the hands of marine researchers, the need for completing missions manually can be eliminated. Landing on a vessel of opportunity is a significant step towards fully autonomous aerial instrumentation for marine-based research. © 2016 IEEE.","Olin College of Engineering, Needham, MA  02492, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85006943857&doi=10.1109%2fOCEANS.2016.7761038&partnerID=40&md5=d524e9577f7f3c8feb0adac8d2ecd170,cited By 0,7761038,10.1109/OCEANS.2016.7761038,,,2016,"OCEANS 2016 MTS/IEEE Monterey, OCE 2016",Protocol for autonomous landing of unmanned air vehicles on research vessels,"Chandra, S. and Chapman, R. and Diverdi, R. and Preston, V. and Woo, J. and Bennett, A. and Barrett, D.",conference,Chandra2016,,"Air navigation;  Cameras;  Computer control;  Computer hardware description languages;  Computer vision;  Controllers;  Errors;  Fighter aircraft;  Global positioning system;  Image processing;  Iterative methods;  Landing;  Location;  Navigation systems;  Open source software;  Open systems;  Photogrammetry;  Ships;  Software engineering;  Surveying;  Surveys;  Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV);  Video signal processing;  Visual servoing, Autonomous landing;  Computer vision techniques;  Controlled environment;  Environmental disturbances;  Intelligent controllers;  Large-scale research;  Unmanned air vehicle (UAVs);  Vehicle navigation, Vehicles",,,9781509015375,,

Despite technological advances and a need for methodological improvements, chromogenic and fluorogenic enzymatic techniques remain the mainstays of water quality monitoring for both public health agencies and regulated utilities. We demonstrated that bioelectroanalytical approaches to FIB enumeration are possible and can be achieved using commercially available enzyme-specific resorufin glycosides, although these are expensive, not widely available or designed for purpose. Following this, we designed two naphthoquinone glycosides which performed better, achieving Escherichia coli detection in the range 5.0 × 102 to 5.0 × 105 CFU ml−1 22–54% quicker than commercially available resorufin glycosides. The molecular design of the naphthoquinone glycosides requires fewer synthetic steps allowing them to be produced for as little as US$50 per kg. Tests with environmental samples demonstrated the low tendency for abiotic interference and that, despite specificity being maintained between β-glucuronidase and β-galactosidase, accurate enumeration of E. coli in environmental samples necessitates development of a selective medium. In comparison to a commercially available detection method, which has U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approval, our approach performed better at high organism concentrations, detecting 500 organisms in 9 h compared with 13.5 h for the commercial method. Bioelectroanalytical detection is comparable to current approved methods and with further development could result in improved detection times. A recent trend for low-cost open-source hardware means that automated, potentiostatically controlled E. coli detection systems could be constructed for less than US$100 per channel. © 2016 The Authors.

Precision measurements were determined to have an average error of 10 μm at the maximum speed and 27 μm at the minimum recorded speed. Accuracy tests yielded an error of 0.15%. The machine is a true 3-D stage and thus able to operate with USB microscopes or conventional desktop microscopes. It is larger than all commercial alternatives, and is thus capable of high-depth images over unprecedented areas and complex geometries. The repeatability is below 2-D microscope stages, but testing shows that it is adequate for the majority of scientific applications. The open-source microscope stage costs less than 3–9% of the closest proprietary commercial stages. This extreme affordability vastly improves accessibility for 3-D microscopy throughout the world. © 2016 The Authors Journal of Microscopy © 2016 Royal Microscopical Society","Department of Materials Science & Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, United States; Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84991260193&doi=10.1111%2fjmi.12433&partnerID=40&md5=a39631a2e0610d46e8de996beb8639b5,cited By 12,,10.1111/jmi.12433,2,264,2016,Journal of Microscopy,Free and open-source automated 3-D microscope,"Wijnen, B. and Petersen, E.E. and Hunt, E.J. and Pearce, J.M.",article,Wijnen2016238,JMICA,accuracy;  Article;  automation;  computer;  microscope;  microscopy;  priority journal;  three dimensional microscope,3-D microscope;  imaging;  microscope;  open hardware;  optics;  stage,238-246,,,

In particular, it can support IP-based wireless connectivity and social networking through the Telegram Bot communicate with the elderly and their authorized persons such as family, a nurse, or a social worker. The user will receive the information from the proposed system, such as on/off states of the power strip, a type of devices connected to the power strip, and current measurement values from them, through a Telegram application on a smartphone. After checking the on/off states, the type of devices, and current measurement values, the user can decide which relays need to be controlled and send text messages with the indices of the specific relays and corresponding commands to the proposed system. Furthermore, to receive any alert messages for power saving and accident prevention, we can change the reference values for the sensors.

This study describes the development of an affordable and robust robotic beer pourer using low-cost sensors, Arduino® boards, Lego® building blocks and servo motors for prototyping. The RoboBEER is also coupled with video capture capabilities (iPhone 5S) and automated post hoc computer vision analysis algorithms to assess different parameters based on foamability, bubble size, alcohol content, temperature, carbon dioxide release and beer color. Results have shown that parameters obtained from different beers by only using the RoboBEER can be used for their classification according to quality and fermentation type. Results were compared to sensory analysis techniques using principal component analysis (PCA) and artificial neural networks (ANN) techniques. The PCA from RoboBEER data explained 73% of variability within the data. From sensory analysis, the PCA explained 67% of the variability and combining RoboBEER and Sensory data, the PCA explained only 59% of data variability. The ANN technique for pattern recognition allowed creating a classification model from the parameters obtained with RoboBEER, achieving 92.4% accuracy in the classification according to quality and fermentation type, which is consistent with the PCA results using data only from RoboBEER. The repeatability and objectivity of beer assessment offered by the RoboBEER could translate into the development of an important practical tool for food scientists, consumers and retail companies to determine differences within beers based on the specific parameters studied. © 2016","University of Melbourne, Faculty of Veterinary and Agricultural SciencesVIC  3010, Australia; University of Melbourne, Department of Mechanical EngineeringVIC  3010, Australia",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85006058923&doi=10.1016%2fj.foodres.2016.08.045&partnerID=40&md5=88b180938c051b33d319a35d4abc4302,cited By 14,,10.1016/j.foodres.2016.08.045,,89,2016,Food Research International,"Development of a robotic pourer constructed with ubiquitous materials, open hardware and sensors to assess beer foam quality using computer vision and pattern recognition algorithms: RoboBEER","Gonzalez Viejo, C. and Fuentes, S. and Li, G. and Collmann, R. and Condé, B. and Torrico, D.",article,GonzalezViejo2016504,FORIE,"Beer;  Carbon;  Carbon dioxide;  Computer hardware;  Computer vision;  Fermentation;  Neural networks;  Pattern recognition;  Robotics;  Sensory analysis, Analysis algorithms;  Analysis techniques;  Bubble size;  Classification models;  Fermentation type;  Objective measure;  Pattern recognition algorithms;  Sensory panels, Principal component analysis",Artificial neural networks;  Beer foam;  Bubble size;  Computer vision;  Sensory panels,504-513,,,

Currently, the application of these approaches is severely limited by the availability of appropriate instrumentation and by the ability to communicate experimental protocols, results and analyses. To address these issues, we have developed a low-cost, yet sophisticated open-source scientific instrument designed to enable communities of researchers, plant breeders, educators, farmers and citizen scientists to collect high-quality field data on a large scale. The MultispeQ provides measurements in the field or laboratory of both, environmental conditions (light intensity and quality, temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, time and location) and useful plant phenotypes, including photosynthetic parameters—photosystem II quantum yield (ΦII), non-photochemical exciton quenching (NPQ), photosystem II photoinhibition, light-driven proton translocation and thylakoid proton motive force, regulation of the chloroplast ATP synthase and potentially many others— and leaf chlorophyll and other pigments. Plant phenotype data are transmitted from the MultispeQ to mobile devices, laptops or desktop computers together with key metadata that gets saved to the PhotosynQ platform (https://photosynq.org) and provides a suite of web-based tools for sharing, visualization, filtering, dissemination and analyses. We present validation experiments, comparing MultispeQ results with established platforms, and show that it can be usefully deployed in both laboratory and field settings. We present evidence that MultispeQ can be used by communities of researchers to rapidly measure, store and analyse multiple environmental and plant properties, allowing for deeper understanding of the complex interactions between plants and their environment. © 2016 The Authors.","MSU-DOE-Plant Research Laboratory, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, United States; Department of Plant, Soil and Microbial Sciences, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, United States; Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, United States; Venturit Inc., East Lansing, MI, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84993978164&doi=10.1098%2frsos.160592&partnerID=40&md5=efe30c2bd2ec4955c6ecab7bd0104c7a,cited By 45,160592,10.1098/rsos.160592,10,3,2016,Royal Society Open Science,MultispeQ Beta: A tool for large-scale plant phenotyping connected to the open photosynQ network,"Kuhlgert, S. and Austic, G. and Zegarac, R. and Osei-Bonsu, I. and Hoh, D. and Chilvers, M.I. and Roth, M.G. and Bi, K. and TerAvest, D. and Weebadde, P. and Kramer, D.M.",article,Kuhlgert2016,,,Agriculture;  Chlorophyll fluorescence;  Open-source hardware;  Phenomics;  Photosynthesis,,,,

However, it has proved challenging to 3D print PDMS in complex structures due to its low elastic modulus and need for support during the printing process. Here we demonstrate the 3D printing of hydrophobic PDMS prepolymer resins within a hydrophilic Carbopol gel support via freeform reversible embedding (FRE). In the FRE printing process, the Carbopol support acts as a Bingham plastic that yields and fluidizes when the syringe tip of the 3D printer moves through it, but acts as a solid for the PDMS extruded within it. This, in combination with the immiscibility of hydrophobic PDMS in the hydrophilic Carbopol, confines the PDMS prepolymer within the support for curing times up to 72 h while maintaining dimensional stability. After printing and curing, the Carbopol support gel releases the embedded PDMS prints by using phosphate buffered saline solution to reduce the Carbopol yield stress. As proof-of-concept, we used Sylgard 184 PDMS to 3D print linear and helical filaments via continuous extrusion and cylindrical and helical tubes via layer-by-layer fabrication. Importantly, we show that the 3D printed tubes were manifold and perfusable. The results demonstrate that hydrophobic polymers with low viscosity and long cure times can be 3D printed using a hydrophilic support, expanding the range of biomaterials that can be used in additive manufacturing. Further, by implementing the technology using low cost open-source hardware and software tools, the FRE printing technique can be rapidly implemented for research applications. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","Department of Biomedical Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA  15213, United States; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA  15213, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84990965834&doi=10.1021%2facsbiomaterials.6b00170&partnerID=40&md5=027291e6a7f15a7d606d1fd546d90a6c,cited By 114,,10.1021/acsbiomaterials.6b00170,10,2,2016,ACS Biomaterials Science and Engineering,3D Printing PDMS Elastomer in a Hydrophilic Support Bath via Freeform Reversible Embedding,"Hinton, T.J. and Hudson, A. and Pusch, K. and Lee, A. and Feinberg, A.W.",article,Hinton20161781,,"carbomer;  dimeticone;  elastomer;  phosphate buffered saline, Article;  chemical stress;  chemical structure;  controlled study;  embedding;  freeform reversible embedding;  hydrophilicity;  hydrophobicity;  microtechnology;  molecular stability;  priority journal;  solid;  three dimensional printing",3D printing;  Carbopol;  FRE printing;  freeform fabrication;  PDMS,1781-1786,,,

Because the mechanism is popped out of the plane to achieve its 3D shape, we present a stiffness analysis to arrive at the out-of-plane (or ‘pop-out’) angles that the planar system must accommodate so that constraints/limits on actuator torque/force can be can satisfied while producing an operational system. The simplicity of the processes makes it a candidate for the use in the emerging open-source hardware technologies for fabricating low-cost, complex, electromechanical systems. © 2016 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84995939790&doi=10.1016%2fj.jmapro.2016.06.016&partnerID=40&md5=799402bb79463d410f61d0c2efabc0bd,cited By 3,,10.1016/j.jmapro.2016.06.016,,24,2016,Journal of Manufacturing Processes,Laminated micro-machine: Design and fabrication of a flexure-based Delta robot,"Correa, J.E. and Toombs, J. and Toombs, N. and Ferreira, P.M.",article,Correa2016370,,"Fabrication;  Flexible electronics;  Laminating;  Machine design;  Manufacture;  Metal cutting;  Robotics;  Robots;  Sheet metal;  Stepping motors, Delta robot;  Electromechanical systems;  Functional components;  Laminated manufacturing;  Manufacturing techniques;  Medical instrumentation;  Open-source hardwares;  Operational systems, Open systems",Delta robot;  Laminated manufacturing;  PC-MEMS,370-375,,,

After that, the amplified and filtered signal is digitized and processed by Arduino Due and registered in an SD memory card. Geophonino is configured for continuous registering, where the sampling frequency, the amplitude gain and the registering time are user-defined. The complete prototype is an open source and open hardware system.

Gardner Family Center for Parkinson's disease and Movement Disorders, University of CincinnatiUnited States; email: alberto.espay@uc.edu","The miniaturization, sophistication, proliferation, and accessibility of technologies are enabling the capture of more and previously inaccessible phenomena in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, more information has not translated into a greater understanding of disease complexity to satisfy diagnostic and therapeutic needs. Challenges include noncompatible technology platforms, the need for wide-scale and long-term deployment of sensor technology (among vulnerable elderly patients in particular), and the gap between the “big data” acquired with sensitive measurement technologies and their limited clinical application. Major opportunities could be realized if new technologies are developed as part of open-source and/or open-hardware platforms that enable multichannel data capture sensitive to the broad range of motor and nonmotor problems that characterize PD and are adaptable into self-adjusting, individualized treatment delivery systems. The International Parkinson and Movement Disorders Society Task Force on Technology is entrusted to convene engineers, clinicians, researchers, and patients to promote the development of integrated measurement and closed-loop therapeutic systems with high patient adherence that also serve to (1) encourage the adoption of clinico-pathophysiologic phenotyping and early detection of critical disease milestones, (2) enhance the tailoring of symptomatic therapy, (3) improve subgroup targeting of patients for future testing of disease-modifying treatments, and (4) identify objective biomarkers to improve the longitudinal tracking of impairments in clinical care and research.

Applying this philosophy to microfluidic devices can play a fundamental role in disseminating these technologies outside specialist labs and into industrial use. Here we show how nanoliter droplets can be manipulated using a commercial DVD writer, interfaced with an Arduino electronic controller. We couple the optical setup with a droplet generation and manipulation device based on the ""confinement gradients"" approach. This device uses regions of different depths to generate and transport the droplets, which further simplifies the operation and reduces the need for precise flow control. The use of robust consumer electronics, combined with open source hardware, leads to a great reduction in the price of the device, as well as its footprint, without reducing its performance compared with the laboratory setup. © 2016 Frot et al.

However, this study also found that brand reputation was insignificant relative to activating a social media platform for open-source software. In addition, activating a social platform for OSHW can positively affect to the brand community's loyalty for OSHW, which means that social platform innovation for OSHW can help form the positive attitude necessary to develop and diffuse an OSHW culture in a rapidly changing ICT ecosystem.

In this paper, based on ethnographic fieldwork studies in Barcelona working with urban accessibility professionals and activists, we argue for the importance of the ‘documentation interfaces’ created in their struggles: that is, the relational processes to collaboratively build multi-media accounts in a diversity of formats seeking to enforce different translations of bodily needs into specific urban accessibility arrangements. In discussion with the asymmetries that the ongoing expertization of accessibility might be opening up, we would like to foreground these apparently irrelevant practices as an interesting site to reflect on how urban accessibility struggles might allow us to rethink the project of technical democracy and its applications to urban issues. Two cases are analyzed: (1) the creation of Streets for All, a platform to contest and to sensitize technicians and citizens alike of the problems of ‘shared streets’ for the blind and partially sighted led by the Catalan Association for the Blind; and (2) the organization of the Tinkerthon, a DIY and open-source hardware workshop boosted by En torno a la silla to facilitate the creation of a network of tinkerers seeking to self-manage accessibility infrastructures. These cases not only bring to the fore different takes on the democratization of the relations between technical professionals and disability rights advocates, but also offer different approaches to the politics of universals in the design of urban accessibility arrangements. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Munich Center for Technology in Society & Department of Architecture, TU München, Germany; Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Spain",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84988023762&doi=10.1080%2f13604813.2016.1194004&partnerID=40&md5=d9e00719aa273a5516929f04ad2fd286,cited By 1,,10.1080/13604813.2016.1194004,4,20,2016,City,Urban accessibility issues: Techno-scientific democratizations at the documentation interface,"Sánchez Criado, T. and Cereceda Otárola, M.",article,SánchezCriado2016619,,,disability;  documentation interfaces;  technical democracy;  universal design;  urban accessibility,619-636,,,
648,Scopus,Conference Paper,Proc. Real Time Syst. Symp.,English,,10528725,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"Having a shared and accurate sense of time is critical to distributed Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the Internet of Things (IoT). Thanks to decades of research in clock technologies and synchronization protocols, it is now possible to measure and synchronize time across distributed systems with unprecedented accuracy. However, applications have not benefited to the same extent due to limitations of the system services that help manage time, and hardware-OS and OS-application interfaces through which timing information flows to the application. Due to the importance of time awareness in a broad range of emerging applications, running on commodity platforms and operating systems, it is imperative to rethink how time is handled across the system stack. We advocate the adoption of a holistic notion of Quality of Time (QoT) that captures metrics such as resolution, accuracy, and stability. Building on this notion we propose an architecture in which the local perception of time is a controllable operating system primitive with observable uncertainty, and where time synchronization balances applications' timing demands with system resources such as energy and bandwidth. Our architecture features an expressive application programming interface that is centered around the abstraction of a timeline - a virtual temporal coordinate frame that is defined by an application to provide its components with a shared sense of time, with a desired accuracy and resolution. The timeline abstraction enables developers to easily write applications whose activities are choreographed across time and space. Leveraging open source hardware and software components, we have implemented an initial Linux realization of the proposed timeline-driven QoT stack on a standard embedded computing platform.

In the networking community, innovative solutions are being developed for the Device Layer of the Internet of Things, which includes the IoT wireless protocols. In order to study their performance, researchers turn more often to real world platforms, commonly designated by the term testbeds, on which they may implement and test the protocols and algorithms. This is even more important in the Industrial IoT field, where environments are perturbed by industrial systems like automated production systems. In this paper, after a brief presentation of the context of testbeds, we introduce WiNo and OpenWiNo, an open hardware and software framework for fast-prototyping in the field of the Internet of Things.

Offering experiments outside of a traditional lab accommodates distance-learning as well as large class sizes. Many authors have addressed comparisons of in-lab laboratories with ones completed virtually or remotely,1,2 however much less has been studied regarding the use of actual, physical laboratories by students at home or in their dormitory rooms outside of the traditional laboratory.3,4 To respond to and leverage technological advancements in portable test and measurement equipment, several student-accessible electronics hardware platforms were considered including the NI myDAQ, Arduino development board, TI LaunchPad, BitScope, Analog Discovery, and a Creative Soundblaster USB Audio System. Ultimately, an initial pilot study with 14 students was conducted in a summer microelectronics course using the NI myDAQ. This, along with high-quality instructional videos, allowed students to complete experiments on their own outside of the laboratory setting. In this study, two of the later course hardware exercises - multi-stage amplifier and op-amp amplifier - were offered to half of the class as labs to be completed outside of the traditional laboratory. Independent validation of the experiment using randomized, multi-stage testing was performed and its effectiveness queried using in-person laboratory observations, instructor discussions, a post-laboratory survey, and student laboratory report assessment. Recommendations for implementing out-of-lab student experiments include anticipating hardware failure, encouraging student collaboration, and providing live TA assistance. As a result of the pilot work, additional laboratory offerings using these recommendations as well as explored alternative hardware solutions are being pursued. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2016.","Duke University, Durham, NC  27708, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84983359471&partnerID=40&md5=df56c598f791c101fd0dc05d1b4701bd,cited By 0,,,,2016-June,2016,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",Massive open online laboratories?

661,Scopus,Conference Paper,"Annu. Int. Syst. Conf., SysCon - Proc.",English,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"This paper presents prototype implementation of low-cost, open hardware, static-gesture recognition system. The implemented system has three major components: A Glove and Sensor Unit (GSU)-consisting of a pair of gloves embedded with custom made, low-cost flex and contact sensors, a Primary Supporting Hardware (PSH) that maps change in input values from GSU, a Secondary Supporting Hardware (SSH) that processes the input values and recognizes the gesture accurately. When a gesture is signed, the GSU tracks the change in orientation of the fingers, which results in a change in voltage levels of the sensors. This change is mapped by the PSH and passed on to SSH which comprises of two ATmega328P microcontrollers, one connected to each of the glove. The two microcontrollers are connected in a master-slave configuration and communication between them is facilitated through an XBee module. The performance of this gesture recognition system is evaluated using a data set comprising of 36 unique gestures. These gestures represent a total of 120 gestures that include all gestures across five globally used sign languages. A gesture recognition engine that resides in the master microcontroller processes the input and identifies the gesture. The gesture recognition engine comprises of a two stage selection-elimination embedded intelligence algorithm that is used to enhance the system efficiency from 83.1% to 94.5% without any additional hardware.

However, many hurdles still exist before these techniques can be used in research laboratories for cellular and molecular biology applications. Extrusion-based bioprinting systems have been characterized by high development costs, injector clogging, difficulty achieving small cell number deposits, decreased cell viability, and altered cell function post-printing. To circumvent the high-price barrier to entry of conventional bioprinters, we designed and 3D printed components for the adaptation of an inexpensive 'off-the-shelf' commercially available 3D printer. We also demonstrate via goal based computer simulations that the needle geometries of conventional commercially standardized, 'luer-lock' syringe-needle systems cause many of the issues plaguing conventional bioprinters. To address these performance limitations we optimized flow within several microneedle geometries, which revealed a short tapered injector design with minimal cylindrical needle length was ideal to minimize cell strain and accretion. We then experimentally quantified these geometries using pulled glass microcapillary pipettes and our modified, low-cost 3D printer. This systems performance validated our models exhibiting: reduced clogging, single cell print resolution, and maintenance of cell viability without the use of a sacrificial vehicle. Using this system we show the successful printing of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into Geltrex and note their retention of a pluripotent state 7 d post printing. We also show embryoid body differentiation of hiPSC by injection into differentiation conducive environments, wherein we observed continuous growth, emergence of various evaginations, and post-printing gene expression indicative of the presence of all three germ layers.

It requires the appropriate infrastructure for recognizing emotional states and reacting accordingly in runtime. In this paper, we describe the open platform that we have implemented (named AICARP v2) to detect changes in physiological signals that can be associated with stressful situations, and when this happens, it recommends the learner to relax by delivering modulated sensorial support in terms of light, sound, or vibration at a relaxation breath rate. In this way, by taking advantage of ambient intelligence, the learner can perceive the recommended action without interrupting the learning activity (in this case, practicing the oral exam of a second language). The signal acquisition of the system (which combines sensors from Libellium e-Health platform with others integrated ad hoc) has been compared with a commercial system (JJ Engineering I-330-C2), obtaining similar outcomes as to identifying significant changes in the physiological signals when the learner experiments an emotional reaction. However, the cost of AICARP v2 is much lower, and at the same time, it is open hardware and flexible and, thus, has the advantage of providing runtime data processing.

This paper clarifies a method for determining an ROI for the development of scientific free and open source hardware (FOSH). By using an open source hardware design that can be manufactured digitally, the relatively minor development costs result in enormous ROIs for the scientific community. A case study is presented of a syringe pump released under open license, which results in ROIs for funders ranging from hundreds to thousands of percent after only a few months.

The widespread availability of open-source hardware together with novel analytical methods based on pulsed flows have opened the possibility of implementing standalone automated analytical systems at low cost. Among the areas that can benefit from this approach are the analysis of industrial products and effluents and environmental analysis. In this work, a multi-pumping flow system is proposed for the determination of phosphorus in effluents and polluted water samples. The system employs photometric detection based on the formation of molybdovanadophosphoric acid, and the fluidic circuit is built using three solenoid micropumps. The detection is implemented with a low cost LED-photodiode photometric detection system and the whole system is controlled by an open-source Arduino Uno microcontroller board. The optimization of the timing to ensure the color development and the pumping cycle is discussed for the proposed implementation.

Due to the flexibility of the hardware, firmware, and software architectures, the platform is capable of interfacing with a wide variety of detector modules not only in medical imaging but also in homeland security applications. Analog signals from radiation detectors share similar characteristics-a pulse whose area is proportional to the deposited energy and whose leading edge is used to extract a timing signal. As a result, a generic design method of the platform is adopted for the hardware, firmware, and software architectures and implementations. The analog front-end is hosted on a module called a Detector Board, where each board can filter, combine, timestamp, and process multiple channels independently. The processed data is formatted and sent through a backplane bus to a module called Support Board, where 1 Support Board can host up to eight Detector Board modules. The data in the Support Board, coming from 8 Detector Board modules, can be aggregated or correlated (if needed) depending on the algorithm implemented or runtime mode selected. It is then sent out to a computer workstation for further processing. The number of channels (detector modules), to be processed, mandates the overall OpenPET System Configuration, which is designed to handle up to 1,024 channels using 16-channel Detector Boards in the Standard System Configuration and 16,384 channels using 32-channel Detector Boards in the Large System Configuration. © 2015 IEEE.","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA  94720, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84954092278&doi=10.1109%2fTNS.2015.2499600&partnerID=40&md5=4e45494db57a9b658227737abc294c0d,cited By 1,7378325,10.1109/TNS.2015.2499600,2,63,2016,IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science,Architecture and Implementation of OpenPET Firmware and Embedded Software,"Abu-Nimeh, F.T. and Ito, J. and Moses, W.W. and Peng, Q. and Choong, W.-S.",article,Abu-Nimeh2016620,IETNA,"Application programs;  Computer workstations;  Data acquisition;  Electronic equipment;  Firmware;  Hardware;  Information dissemination;  Medical imaging;  Open source software;  Radiation detectors;  Signal processing, High-performance platforms;  Homeland security applications;  Instrumentation;  Multichannel data;  Multiple channels;  Nuclear imaging;  Open-source hardwares;  System configurations, Open systems",Electronics;  Instrumentation;  Nuclear imaging;  Open source hardware;  Open source software,620-629,,,

While these plates have a good track record, they can become symptomatic and require removal once the fracture has healed. Open hardware removal is associated with a number of additional risks to the patient, including infection, scarring, nerve damage, and blood loss. In addition, the recovery time after open hardware removal may be prolonged, thereby predisposing the patient to postoperative stiffness. The purpose of this article is to describe a technique for removing proximal humerus locking plates arthroscopically. Although technically demanding, the benefits of this technique include smaller incisions, quicker recovery time, decreased risk of infection, and reduced blood loss.

The dependability of the Internet of Things is critical because the services will be concerned with real life. However, the inexpensive hardware provides limited resources for communication. In this paper, we present exact all-terminal reliability of the wireless networks of which the number of links of each node is bounded. First, we analyze the all-terminal reliability of the regular wireless network, where any two nodes are connected by a wireless link consisting of a pair of radio modules. The reliability polynomial is derived from the Tutte polynomial that is the seminal work of the algebraic graph theory. Second, we analyze the all-terminal reliability of the wireless network including the random mesh network under the assumption that if the module fails, all radio links connected through a radio module are cut off. We consider both the fault of the communication module and the fading of the wireless channel in the indoor channel condition. For improving the reliability, we also propose a fault-tolerant method giving redundant radio modules into each node. We also analyze cost-effectiveness. We also calculate the mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) for wireless networks. We show that the random mesh network of which each node includes three or more the radio-broadcast modules is more dependable than any other regular network of which each node comprises four point-to-point modules if it is the connected graph in the static environment. © 2014 IEEE.","School of Computer Science and Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Dongjak-Ku, 156-756, South Korea",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84963750665&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2015.2496259&partnerID=40&md5=e719b8d175904696c11715da2c8d006d,cited By 11,7312886,10.1109/JIOT.2015.2496259,2,3,2016,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,All-Terminal Reliability Analysis of Wireless Networks of Redundant Radio Modules,"Park, J.-H.",article,Park2016219,,"Broadcasting;  Cost effectiveness;  Fading (radio);  Graph theory;  Hardware;  Internet;  Internet of things;  Mesh generation;  MESH networking;  Open source software;  Open systems;  Radio broadcasting;  Radio links;  Reconfigurable hardware;  Reliability;  Reliability theory;  Telecommunication networks;  Wireless networks, All terminal reliability;  Module networks;  Point-to-point link;  Random meshes;  Regular networks, Reliability analysis",All-terminal reliability;  Internet of Things;  Point-to-point link networks;  Radio broadcast module networks;  Reliability analysis;  Wireless random mesh networks;  Wireless regular networks,219-230,,,

One parameter to assess the water transparency is the diffuse attenuation coefficient. However, the number of subsurface irradiance measurements obtained with conventional instrumentation is relatively low, due to instrument costs and the logistic requirements to provide regular and autonomous observations. In recent years, the citizen science concept has increased the number of environmental observations, both in time and space. The recent technological advances in embedded systems and sensors also enable volunteers (citizens) to create their own devices (known as Do-It-Yourself or DIY technologies). In this paper, a DIY instrument to measure irradiance at different depths and automatically calculate the diffuse attenuation Kd coefficient is presented. The instrument, named KdUINO, is based on an encapsulated low-cost photonic sensor and Arduino (an open-hardware platform for the data acquisition). The whole instrument has been successfully operated and the data validated comparing the KdUINO measurements with the commercial instruments. Workshops have been organized with high school students to validate its feasibility. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Department of Physical and Technological Oceanography, Marine Sciences Institute (ICM-CSIC), 37–49 Passeig Marítim de la Barceloneta, Barcelona, E-08003, Spain; Department of Physical Oceanography, Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ), PO Box 59, Den Burg, Texel, 1790AB, Netherlands",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84961249487&doi=10.3390%2fs16030373&partnerID=40&md5=8f707565c77f1681bd8d908910b2de48,cited By 14,373,10.3390/s16030373,3,16,2016,Sensors (Switzerland),Estimating the underwater diffuse attenuation coefficient with a low-cost instrument: The KdUINO DIY buoy,"Bardaji, R. and Sánchez, A.-M. and Simon, C. and Wernand, M.R. and Piera, J.",article,Bardaji2016,,"Buoys;  Data acquisition;  Embedded systems;  Light;  Oceanography;  Transparency;  Water quality, Arduino;  Citizen science;  Diffuse attenuation coefficients;  Do it yourself;  KdUINO;  Low-cost sensors, Costs",Arduino;  Buoy;  Citizen science;  Diffuse attenuation coefficient;  Do-it-yourself;  KdUINO;  Light;  Low-cost sensor;  Oceanography,,,,

This requires minimal post-print clean-up and can be automated with readily available stepper motors. The resulting plastic composite structure is very stiff and exhibits remarkably low drift, moving less than 20 μm over the course of a week, without temperature stabilisation. This enables us to construct a miniature microscope with excellent mechanical stability, perfect for time-lapse measurements in situ in an incubator or fume hood. The ease of manufacture lends itself to use in containment facilities where disposability is advantageous and to experiments requiring many microscopes in parallel. High performance mechanisms based on printed flexures need not be limited to microscopy, and we anticipate their use in other devices both within the laboratory and beyond. © 2016 Author(s).","Nanophotonics Centre, Department of Physics, Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB3 0HE, United Kingdom; Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 1PZ, United Kingdom",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84959421850&doi=10.1063%2f1.4941068&partnerID=40&md5=d6c4eec7e3833d7985dfb539bce720be,cited By 25,025104,10.1063/1.4941068,2,87,2016,Review of Scientific Instruments,A one-piece 3D printed flexure translation stage for open-source microscopy,"Sharkey, J.P. and Foo, D.C.W. and Kabla, A. and Baumberg, J.J. and Bowman, R.W.",article,Sharkey2016,RSINA,"Compliant mechanisms;  Fume control;  Mechanical stability;  Open systems;  Stages;  Stepping motors, Mechanical design;  Open sources;  Open-source hardwares;  Scientific instrument;  Stepper motor;  Submicron scale;  Temperature stabilisation;  Translation stage, 3D printers",,,,,

In the RoboCup MSL, two teams of five autonomous robots play on an 18-X 12-m field. Equipped with sensors and on-board computers, each robot should be able to perceive the environment, make decision and control itself to play the soccer game autonomously. Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents the design of our soccer robots, participating in RoboCup MSL. The mechanical platform, electrical architecture and software framework are discussed separately. The mechanical platform is designed modularly, so easy maintainability is achieved; the electronic architecture is built on industrial standards using PC-based control technique, which results in high robustness and reliability during the intensive and fierce MSL games; the software is developed upon the open-source Robot Operating System (ROS); thus, the advantages of ROS such as modularity, portability and expansibility are inherited. Findings: Based on this paper and the open-source hardware and software, the MSL robots can be re-developed easily to participate in the RoboCup MSL. The robots can also be used in other research and education fields, especially for multi-robot systems and distributed artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the main designing ideas proposed in the paper, i.e. using a modular mechanical structure, an industrial electronic system and ROS-based software, provide a common solution for designing general intelligent robots.

One of the most successful example is the Robot Operating System (ROS), which aims at supporting robot development and research in robotics by providing a modular and general purpose software framework; yet, at a lower level, i.e., mechanics, electronics, and firmware, component-based robotics is still in its early stages. Moreover, basic functionalities, such as robust odometry and pose tracking, seem to be solved on an ad-hoc basis, while no generic solution can be plugged in a system as an off-the-shelf component. This paper presents two modular tools for the development of robotics applications and how these can be deployed on different robot platforms as off-the-shelf, open hardware and open software, components at the hardware, firmware, and core software levels. A case study based on two mobile platforms is described showing how it is possible to reuse physical components in the building of a mobile robot and provide an off-the-shelf architecture which sports multi-sensor fusion for robust odometry and pose tracking, requiring a fraction of the effort with respect to ad hoc techniques. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria, Politecnico di Milano, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, Milano, 20133, Italy",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84945903514&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-08338-4_104&partnerID=40&md5=8662b91014d2b56bea778e23fc903c80,cited By 2,,10.1007/978-3-319-08338-4_104,,302,2016,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,Development of mobile robots using off-the-shelf open-source hardware and software components for motion and pose tracking,"Cucci, D.A. and Migliavacca, M. and Bonarini, A. and Matteucci, M.",article,Cucci20161451,,"Application programs;  Computer programming;  Computer software reusability;  Firmware;  Hardware;  Mobile robots;  Navigation;  Open source software;  Robotics;  Robots, General purpose software;  Hardware and software components;  Multi-sensor fusion;  Off-the-shelf components;  Open-source hardwares;  Physical components;  Robot operating systems (ROS);  Robotics applications, Open systems",,1451-1465,9783319083377,"Yamaguchi H., Michael N., Berns K., Menegatti E.",

The proposed data acquisition (DAQ) system has features that it uses the framed data protocol based on hex encoding, it can acquire multiple data which are not of the same type at different sample rates, and the system receives data through USB communication or serial communication. The software of the proposed system consists of the firmware of a microcontroller and user-defined Simulink function block. The firmware of a microcontroller is in the form of a header file, and the data acquisition can be easily achieved by calling a few functions defined in the header file. The developed user-defined Simulink block can get multiple data at different sample rates by configuring the GUI parameters appropriately. For implementation of the system, we use the Arch Max, which is the open-source hardware with an ARM Cortex-M4 core, and also use a user-defined c-code S-function of Matlab/Simulink. For the demonstration of the superiority of the implemented system, we compare the proposed system's performance with that of the data acquisition system provided in Matlab/Simulink Instrument Control Toolbox.

Citizen-based contributions can fill observational gaps and increase environmental stewardship amongst the public. For this purpose, tools and methods for citizen science need to (1) complement existing datasets; and (2) be affordable, while appealing to different user and developer groups. In this article, tools and methods developed in the 7th Framework Programme of European Union (EU FP 7) funded project Citclops (citizens' observatories for coast and ocean optical monitoring) are reviewed. Tools range from a stand-alone smartphone app to devices with Arduino and 3-D printing, and hence are attractive to a diversity of users; from the general public to more specified maker- and open labware movements. Standardization to common water quality parameters and methods allows long-term storage in regular marine data repositories, such as SeaDataNet and EMODnet, thereby providing open data access. Due to the given intercomparability to existing remote sensing datasets, these tools are ready to complement the marine datapool. In the future, such combined satellite and citizen observations may set measurements by the engaged public in a larger context and hence increase their individual meaning.

The frequently cited promises of modular robotics—versatility, robustness, and low cost—assume the availability of large numbers of modules. However, modules in most MR prototypes are large, mechanically complex, expensive, and difficult to manufacture. Soldercubes partially overcome this contradiction through optimizing some components for volume manufacturing processes. With the integration of a soldering connector which weighs only 2 g and has no moving parts, Soldercubes are among the cheapest, lightest and smallest among comparable self-reconfiguring MR systems. This paper describes the Soldercube module design in detail, reports on experiments in a lattice configuration, explores non-lattice applications of the system, and discusses the effects of utilising volume manufacturing processes in module production.

Here we study firm openness in 3D printing, with a case study of how MakerBot Industries leveraged external communities and selective openness become the consumer market leader. After reviewing the literature on systemic innovation and selective openness, we document the proprietary strategies of a dozen startup companies during the first two decades of the 3D printing industry. We contrast this to the open hardware, software and content strategy that MakerBot's founders used to enter and grow the consumer market from 2009 onward. We show how MakerBot shifted to a selectively open, systemic innovation strategy that complemented proprietary hardware and software with open user-generated content from its Thingiverse online community.

The specific requirement of the Direction of the airport was to implement a fully automatic system, with no human supervision, to prevent passengers in a lift to be stranded on a floor, or trapped in a lift, where a fire has broken out. The Direction of ADR added some further specific project requirements: - The hardware and software of the system was to have ""open"" architecture - The system had to be reliable and with a high level of safety; - Reduce to a minimum the probability of false alarms and safeguard the capability of the system to start with a real fire alarm. The Satellite terminal G gates were chosen to start the project. Escalators and moving walks (EMWs) have also been included in the system. To reduce the probability of false alarms a 3D simulation model of a map of fire sensors, based on about 1400 sensors in the Terminal and statistical data coming from about 18,000 fire sensors, has been prepared and verified. The requirements of open hardware (PLCs (Programmable Logic Computers) and electronic equipment) and open software (PLC and SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) software) have been fully accomplished and the system is now operative in the Terminal G gates.

Within this context, the farm's management decisions include information from data collected about the crops health development, which need to be gathered in a timely basis. There are several means of obtaining information about the plants health, including manual data collection from sensors installed in the soil and/or its vicinity, mobile sensor systems, for example embedded sensors in UAVs, or aircrafts, or other vehicles, and satellite imagery, to name just a few examples. The adoption of UAVs in such applications has gaining a lot of attention in recent years due to ease of access, low cost and available flight control software. UAV systems may carry several sensors, which include RGB, infrared, multispectral and hyper-spectral cameras. These cameras are respectively more powerful, in terms of data quality, as well as more expensive. The current paper contribution include the platform model, design and characterization of a multispectral camera system made from two low cost, commercial of the shelf cameras that can be integrated in a small UAV.

Environmental downtime is a significant cost to organizations and makes them unable to do business because what happens in the data center affects everyone. In addition, the amount of electrical energy consumed by data center increases with the amount of computing power installed. One strategy of reducing energy consumption in data centers is to adjust the temperature and humidity data. Installation of physical Information Technology and facilities related to environment on monitoring temperature, humidity, power, flood, smoke, air flow, room entry is the most proactive way to reduce the unnecessary costs of expensive hardware replacement or unplanned downtime and decrease energy consumed by servers. In this paper, we present remote system for monitoring auxiliary data centers implemented using open-source hardware platforms, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and the Gobetwino. The objective of collecting temperature and humidity data allows monitoring server's health and gets alerts if things start to go wrong. When the temperature hits 50oC., the supervisor at remote headquarters would get a SMS, then take appropriate actions that make sense to reduce electrical costs and preserve functionality of servers in auxiliary data centers.

Commercial solutions can effectively address vertical application domains, but they often lead to technology lock-ins that limit horizontal composability and reuse. We review some important barriers that hinder WSN use in IoT applications and highlight the main effort and cost components. With these elements in mind, we propose an open hardware-software development platform that can optimize the value flow between technologies and actors with stakes in WSN applications.

In this paper, an open hardware architecture for designing a modular wireless sensor node for health monitoring is proposed. By separating the connection and sensing functions in two separate boards, compliant with the IEEE1451 standard, we add plug and play capabilities to analog transducers, while granting at the same time a high level of customization. As an additional contribution of the work, we developed a cosimulation tool which simplifies the physical connection with the hardware devices and provides support for complex systems.

To produce good design thinkers, design activities must be implemented in engineering curriculums, and have to start at early years. In this prospect, many leading universities have launched many interesting initiatives. These initiatives are, however, arduous for implementation in the context of universities in the developing countries due to deep-rooted local constraints, like shortage of financial and skilled human resources. Therefore, some tailored design learning initiatives, taking into account these constraints, have to be developed. In this context, a cost-effective project has been designed and implemented, in our faculty, to early introduce mechanical engineering students, in their first years, to engineering design. The proposed project was designed with respect to a proposed framework of desired engineering design competencies in conjunction with concerns for overcoming constraints and barriers of implementation context. The project encompasses two successive activities for the first and second years. The first activity plunges the students in a design thinking approach to create robotic applications using only cost-effective robotic kits. The second activity is dedicated to the design, analysis, and building of mechanical systems using only commonly used materials and cheap open hardware devices. Through this project, the students significantly improved some targeted skills as creative problem solving, communication, and teamwork. Finally, the project is thought to be valuable for all universities with similar context of limited resources. © SAGE Publications.","Mechanical Department, Faculty of Sciences and Technologies, University Sidi Mohammed Ben Abdellah, Fez, 30000, Morocco",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84971016664&doi=10.1177%2f0306419016641006&partnerID=40&md5=149e03242c14eec6dacdaa5c60bd3df8,cited By 7,,10.1177/0306419016641006,2,44,2016,International Journal of Mechanical Engineering Education,Strengthening engineering design skills of first-year university students under resources constraints,"Kojmane, J. and Aboutajeddine, A.",article,Kojmane2016148,IMEEB,,design and build activities;  design thinking;  Engineering design;  first and second year engineering students;  mechanical engineering education,148-164,,,

Certain introductory lessons in computer sciences and electronics were required for the students to acquire the necessary skills and to fill gaps in their background knowledge. In addition, lectures by seismologists and specific laboratory activities allowed the class to explore different aspects of the physics of earthquakes, particularly of the seismic waves, and to become familiar with seismic-hazard topics through inquiry-based learning.

BCI based on non-invasive neuroimaging techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG) have many applications, however the dissemination of the technology is limited, in part because of the price of the hardware. In this paper we compare side by side two EEG amplifiers, the consumer grade OpenBCI and the medical grade g.tec g. USBamp. For this purpose, we employed an original montage, based on the simultaneous recording of the same set of electrodes. Two set of recordings were performed. During the first experiment a simple adapter with a direct connection between the amplifiers and the electrodes was used. Then, in a second experiment, we attempted to discard any possible interference that one amplifier could cause to the other by adding ""ideal"" diodes to the adapter. Both spectral and temporal features were tested - the former with a workload monitoring task, the latter with an visual P300 speller task. Overall, the results suggest that the OpenBCI board - or a similar solution based on the Texas Instrument ADS1299 chip - could be an effective alternative to traditional EEG devices. Even though a medical grade equipment still outperforms the OpenBCI, the latter gives very close EEG readings, resulting in practice in a classification accuracy that may be suitable for popularizing BCI uses.

The lack of communication also impedes responder efforts to gather, organize, and disseminate information. This problem is made worse by the unique cost and operational constraints typically associated with the humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) space. In response, we present a low-cost, scalable system that creates a wide-area, best-effort, ad-hoc wireless network for emergency information. The Communication Assistance Technology over Ad-Hoc Networks (CATAN) system embraces the maker and do it yourself (DIY) communities by leveraging open-source and hobbyist technologies to create cheap, lightweight, battery-powered nodes that can be deployed quickly for a variety of operations. CATAN enables geographically separated users to share information on standard interfaces, i.e. web and SMS, over commonly-used communication interfaces, i.e. GSM and Wi-Fi. These interfaces enable CATAN to accommodate a variety of digital devices while leveraging the global ubiquity of cellular devices. By emphasizing simple, mature, technologies, CATAN avoids many problems that hinder many general purpose ad-hoc technologies.

Supplies quickly ran dry, so a group gathered in Tokyo's Hackerspace to design and build their own under the name Safecast. Before they did anything, they consulted the Internet. Joichi Ito, director of the MIT Media Lab and founding member of Safecast, explained at the group's anniversary and conference in March this year: ""When we had the earthquake, most of us didn't know about radiation or even starting up communities. We called out on the Internet, asking: 'Do you know anything about this?' Someone would say 'I know the person who did the monitoring sensors for Three Mile Island'. ""We put together quite a good team having started from zero. We couldn't have designed this as quickly without open hardware or without the help of the Internet. That is a big trend that we are seeing the beginning of."" The result of the hacking project was the bGeigie, a combination of a Geiger counter, GPS receiver and data recorder. Users submit their data to the Safecast database by uploading it from the bGeigie's SD card, usually from a network-enabled computer rather than the device itself.

Instead of a single-core processor, multi-core and many-core processors have been mainstream to accelerate applications by parallel processing. Year by year, the number of cores integrated in a single chip has been increased due to improvements of semiconductor integration technologies depending on Moore's Law. On the other hand, Moore's Law will be ended in the near future. This means that the approaches relying on the increase in the number of cores will be hopeless, thus we have to consider other effective ways. One of them is to design application specific hardware. Several research organizations have explored it and reported its remarkable findings. We focus on such an acceleration approach with dedicated hardware. As a case study with dedicated hardware, we present a sorting acceleration method. Sorting is an extremely important computation kernel that should be accelerated in a lot of fields, such as databases, image processing, data compression, etc. We propose a sorting accelerator combining Sorting Network and Merge Sorter Tree, and detail the design and implementation. Our proposed sorting accelerator is customizable, thus designers can implement a sorting accelerator composed of required hardware resources by means of tuning design parameters. Our experiments show that the proposed hardware achieves up to 10.06x sorting performance, compared with Intel Core i7-4770 operating at 3.4GHz, when sorting 256M 32-bits integer elements.

An embedded system with Robot Operating System (ROS) onboard has been deployed on the surface vehicle. One of the main advantages of the proposed solution is its reduced cost owing to open-hardware/software solutions. In particular, an open-hardware solution is responsible for the interfacing of an RTK GPS with a bathymetric ultrasound sensor to map the sea / lake / river floor. The boat can be either remotely controllable or fully autonomous. An Augmented Reality (AR) application has been also developed to show the path and the set of survey blocks that are mapped / not mapped.

This realistic vision gives the surgeon the feeling of operating in real space. Hospital of Treviglio-Caravaggio isn't an university or scientific institution; in 2014 a new 3D laparoscopic technology was acquired therefore it led to evaluation of the of the appropriateness in term of patient outcome and safety. The project aims at achieving the development of a quantitative validation model that would ensure low cost and a reliable measure of the performance of 3D technology versus 2D mode. In addition, it aims at demonstrating how new technologies, such as open source hardware and software and 3D printing, could help research with no significant cost increase. For these reasons, in order to define criteria of appropriateness in the use of 3D technologies, it was decided to perform a study to technically validate the use of the best technology in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and safety in the use of a system between laparoscopic vision in 3D and the traditional 2D. METHODS: 30 surgeons were enrolled in order to perform an exercise through the use of laparoscopic forceps inside a trainer. The exercise consisted of having surgeons with different level of seniority, grouped by type of specialization (eg. surgery, urology, gynecology), exercising videolaparoscopy with two technologies (2D and 3D) through the use of a anthropometric phantom. The target assigned to the surgeon was that to pass ""needle and thread"" without touching the metal part in the shortest time possible. The rings selected for the exercise had each a coefficient of difficulty determined by depth, diameter, angle from the positioning and from the point of view. RESULTS: The analysis of the data collected from the above exercise has mathematically confirmed that the 3D technique ensures a learning curve lower in novice and greater accuracy in the performance of the task with respect to 2D. © 2015 IEEE.","Clinical Engineering, A.O.

The system has been used to record changes in temperature and humidity inside hives and assess bees' thermoregulation adaptability within colonies in hives with opened-screened bottom boards; an interesting management tool for controlling the harmful Varroa destructor mite as compared to beehives with conventional closed bottom boards. The results revealed that bee colonies were able to thermoregulate in hives with open anti-Varroa bottom boards to the same degree as those in conventional bottom board hives even under winter conditions in a mediterranean climate, thus indicating that there are no additional risks associated with the use of open-screened bottom board models. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Department of Computer Architecture, Electronics and Electronic Technology, University of Córdoba, Campus of Rabanales, Córdoba, 14071, Spain; Department of Zoology, University of Córdoba, Campus of Rabanales, Córdoba, 14071, Spain",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84946729053&doi=10.1016%2fj.compag.2015.10.018&partnerID=40&md5=b5e6813ad45b2fb4866c923b5e750027,cited By 9,,10.1016/j.compag.2015.10.018,,119,2015,Computers and Electronics in Agriculture,Implementation of an electronic system to monitor the thermoregulatory capacity of honeybee colonies in hives with open-screened bottom boards,"Sánchez, Ví. and Gil, S. and Flores, J.M. and Quiles, F.J. and Ortiz, M.A. and Luna, J.J.",article,Sánchez2015209,CEAGE,"Atmospheric humidity;  Climate models;  Monitoring;  Temperature, Arduino;  Biological variables;  Honey bee;  Mediterranean climates;  Particular condition;  Precision beekeeping;  Temperature and humidities;  Temperature and humidity sensor, Humidity control, biomonitoring;  electronic equipment;  honeybee;  humidity;  Mediterranean environment;  mite;  precision agriculture;  sensor;  temperature;  thermoregulation, Acari;  Apis mellifera;  Apoidea;  Varroa;  Varroa destructor",Arduino;  Honey bee;  Humidity;  Monitoring;  Precision beekeeping;  Temperature,209-216,,,

The design is based on a tailless, staggered tandem wing configuration, with a carbon fiber frame and electric propulsion. The developed aircraft has a maximum weight of 12.5 kg, well within the 25 kg limit outlined by Transport Canada for permission-free operation. The UAV was designed to fly missions exceeding 24 hours, performing surveillance and oil pipeline monitoring and inspection, either autonomously or under radio control from a ground station, with medium to high payload capacity. This paper describes the process of designing, manufacturing and testing the developed configuration. The operational requirements are delineated as conceptualized by the development team. A description of the prototype development, including aerodynamics, structural and stability performance, and stability derivatives is included, based on data generated through analytical analysis, simulations in the aerodynamics and stability design software, XFLR5, and testing. The configuration was developed and modeled in the software package SolidWorks, leading to the manufacturing plans for the prototype. As this UAV performs radio controlled and autonomous flights, it makes use of the APM Arduplane, which is an open source hardware and software autopilot package. In order to achieve PID tuning, Hardware in the Loop (HIL) simulations were performed between the autopilot board and two computers simultaneously running the Mission Planner software and the flight simulator X-Plane 10 software. A description of this tuning process is provided.

Drawing from long-term ethnographic research, this article examines how China’s makers demarcate Chinese manufacturing as a site of expertise in implementing this vision. China’s makers demonstrate that the future of making—if to materialize in the ways currently envisioned by writers, politicians, and scholars of the global tech industry—rests on taking seriously the technological and cultural fabrics of professional making outside familiar information technology innovation hubs like Silicon Valley: making-do, mass production, and reuse. I trace back to China’s first hackerspace, documenting how a collective of makers began to move away from appropriating Western concepts of openness toward promoting China as source for knowledge, creativity, and innovation. This article demonstrates that when China’s makers set up open hardware businesses and articulate a unique culture of “hacking with Chinese characteristics,” they draw boundaries between the professional making they saw embodied in Chinese industrial production and the hobbyist making embodied in Western histories and cultures of hacking. In so doing, they position China as site of both technological and cultural expertise, intervening in dominant conceptions of computing that split manufacturing and innovation along geographical lines.

Obtaining real-time non-invasive information to monitor crops or make yield predictions is a challenge. An approach is to use crop yield models in combination with real-time data used as input in such models. It was demonstrated that it is possible to design an accurate system using open source hardware and open systems to record the input for these models and monitor crops. The system presented has two main components: a device that records environmental parameters and a smartphone application (software) that links this device to a data server in order to process and analyse the information. The solution is scalable in terms of the type of sensors used (i.e. temperature and relative humidity of the air or soil), the rate of information retrieval and so on, so it can be used in various scenarios, including environmental or land policy monitoring. Moreover, this open source hardware can be used by a broad variety of users and is an alternative in poor rural areas because of its low cost compared to other solutions. It can enable increased agricultural production and management of the local environment, bringing new agricultural practices to these areas.

Predominantly, they take the sole perspective of platform providers, those bundling hardware and software or more rarely, the perspective of third-party software developers developing valuable software 'apps' that add value to the overall platform. In this conceptual article, we grasp openness more holistically, both by acknowledging that openness means different things to different people and involve all stakeholders within the platforms/ecosystems. Towards the development of a theory of openness within digital settings, we propose six novel aspects of openness for enabling a greater understanding of the open-source software movement with a digital platforms/ecosystems perspective. Moreover, we invite scholars to reconsider the more predominating product-dominant logic in open-source software research to a more holistic logic embracing platforms and ecosystem thinking.","Turku School of Economics, University of Turku, Turku, Finland",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84963612316&doi=10.1145%2f2788993.2789829&partnerID=40&md5=ddfa63d8514d979a0126f367f1d7260d,cited By 1,a4,10.1145/2788993.2789829,,,2015,"Proceedings of the 11th International Symposium on Open Collaboration, OPENSYM 2015",On the openness of digital platforms/ecosystems,"Teixeira, J.",conference,Teixeira2015,,"Computer software;  Ecology;  Ecosystems;  Hardware;  Open systems;  Reconfigurable hardware;  Software engineering, Digital infrastructures;  FLOSS;  Open Access;  Open datum;  Open hardware;  Open sources;  Openness;  Platforms, Open source software",Digital infrastructures;  Ecosystems;  FLOSS;  Open-access;  Open-data;  Open-hardware;  Open-source;  Openness;  OSS;  Platforms,,9781450336666,,

Aluminum oxide, boron nitride, and titanium nitride coatings were evaluated as possible substrate release agents for aluminum printing. Additionally, the in situ formation of substrate release agents such as intermetallics and oxides were tested for both aluminum and steel printing. Testing was performed with a modified Charpy impact tester to remove 3-D printed metal parts from an 1100 aluminum or A36 low carbon steel print substrate to assess the impact energy required for removal. Specimen porosity was measured prior to sectioning and microstructural analysis, hardness traverses were measured across the specimens, and the elastic and shear moduli of the parts were analyzed via ultrasonic methods. All of the employed substrate release mechanisms minimized weld penetration and, in some instances, formed a brittle phase with the print substrate that allowed the specimens to be removed with minimal impact energy. These results thus provide methods with the removal of metal 3-D printed parts from print substrates with no specialized tooling or equipment conducive to distributed manufacturing. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Power consumption monitoring in manufacturing companies can lead to a reduction of machine tools energy wastes and consequently to lower expenses. To this end, a complete transparency of energy usage among the entire manufacturing facilities is required. Despite the small volume of material processed, micro manufacturing processes are energy intensive and the optimization of energy usage becomes critical for manufacturing sustainability. Electrical discharge machining (EDM) is considered an attractive solution for the manufacturing of microcomponents. In this paper, a low cost and modular data acquisition system, based on open-hardware and open-source software, for online energy consumption monitoring, is presented. The system described is applied for energy efficiency analysis of the micro EDM milling process by using a state of the art commercial machine tool. A number of sensors is connected to the data acquisition system to measure the energy consumption of the main sub-systems of the machine tool, data is recorded through a microcontroller, and sent to the main computer via Wi-Fi for data storage and analysis. Results show that the process efficiency depends on machine parameters but it is always far below 0.01 %.

Open systems have a reputation for being difficult to acquire, poorly documented, and hard to maintain. With the arrival of more powerful and compact integrated circuits, rapid prototyping services, and web-based tools for collaborative development, these stereotypes must be reconsidered. We discuss some of the reasons why multichannel extracellular electrophysiology could benefit from open-source approaches and describe examples of successful community-driven tool development within this field. In order to promote the adoption of open-source hardware and to reduce the need for redundant development efforts, we advocate a move toward standardized interfaces that connect each element of the data processing pipeline.

The objective of this study is to investigate the potential of open-source (OS) technologies in an educational setting, given the combination of economic constraints affecting all educational environments and the ability of OS design to profoundly decrease the cost of technological tools and technological innovation. Methods: This paper reports on a 3-day workshop augmented with online instructional and visual tools designed for middle school and high school level educators from a wide array of disciplines (including traditional science, math, and engineering as well as computer, shop, and art). Teachers (n=22) submitted applications to participate in the workshop, the workshop was observed for both evaluation and research, teachers participated in focus groups (n=2) during the workshop in order to discuss their interest in OS 3-D printing technology and its potential role in their classrooms, and teachers completed a voluntary post-workshop survey and responded to follow-up after printers were in the classroom for one year. Results: During the workshop teachers built 3-D printers using OS technologies that they were then able to take back to their schools and into their classrooms. Conclusion: Through workshops augmented with online instructional and visual tools designed to provide facilitated yet self-directed engagement with a new, relatively unknown, and relatively complex technology, paired teacher teams were able to successfully build and use RepRap 3-D printers based on OS design in just three days. Practice: Here, we discuss both what the teachers learned and what we learned from the teachers regarding the potential for educators to construct OS 3-D printing technologies as a tool of empowering and transformative education.

X4-MaG is a small, low-cost open quadrotor of only 307-grammes which offers two levels of controllers providing a manual mode and an automatic mode thanks to powerful Linux-based controller embedded onboard. The experiments presented here show the reliability of the open hardware and software embedded onboard the quadrotor. To estimate the robot s attitude, a quaternion-based complementary filter requiring very few computational resources was developed and implemented on an 8-bit Arduino board. It was also established that the stabilization feedback system based on quaternions tracks the attitude setpoints with precision up to twice greater than a classical cascaded PI controller. The controllers and estimators were designed in the Matlab/Simulink environment and directly implemented onboard the tiny Linux-based autopilot board using a custom made toolbox (RT-MaG toolbox). The autopilot was tested in the brand-new Marseilles Flying Arena with various 3-D flight trajectories and found to be highly accurate with errors of only 0.7cm in hover and less than 3.2cm at 1.2m.s-1.

Going forward, funders should consider requiring that educational resources and concomitant data resulting from their sponsorship should be open, as a public good. There are, however, many other forms of open practice that bring value to the GFSP. Nine different open strategies and tactics (Appendix A) are described, including: open content (including OER and open courseware), open data, open access (research), open government, open source software, open standards, open policy, open licensing and open hardware. It is recommended that all stakeholders proactively pursue ""openness"" as an operating principle. This paper presents an overall GFSP Open Ecosystem Engagement Strategy within which specific local case examples can be situated. Two different case examples, China and Colombia, are presented to show both project-based and crowd-sourced, direct-to-public paths through this ecosystem. © 2015 Stacey P et al.","Creative Commons, Mountain ViewCA  94042, United States; Center for Open Educational Resources and Language Learning (COERLL), University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX  7871, United States; College of Veterinary Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI  48824, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84937546089&doi=10.12688%2ff1000research.6123.1&partnerID=40&md5=c19073afcb2e6a5b6319abff016de82a,cited By 1,129,10.12688/f1000research.6123.1,,4,2015,F1000Research,An open ecosystem engagement strategy through the lens of global food safety,"Stacey, P. and Fons, G. and Bernardo, T.M.",article,Stacey2015,,Article;  China;  climate change;  Colombia;  conceptual framework;  cost effectiveness analysis;  curriculum;  employment;  environmental sustainability;  food quality;  food safety;  food security;  human;  international cooperation;  knowledge;  open access;  open content;  open data;  open ecosystem engagement strategy;  open government;  open hardware;  open licensing;  open policy;  open source software;  open standard;  open study;  policy;  public-private partnership,,,,,

Closed-loop DBS with real-time feedback is gaining attention in recent years, after proved more effective than conventional DBS in terms of pathological symptom control clinically. Here we demonstrate the conceptualization and validation of a closed-loop DBS system using open-source hardware. We used hippocampal theta oscillations as system input, and electrical stimulation in the mesencephalic reticular formation (mRt) as controller output. It is well documented that hippocampal theta oscillations are highly related to locomotion, while electrical stimulation in the mRt induces freezing. We used an Arduino open-source microcontroller between input and output sources. This allowed us to use hippocampal local field potentials (LFPs) to steer electrical stimulation in the mRt. Our results showed that closed-loop DBS significantly suppressed locomotion compared to no stimulation, and required on average only 56% of the stimulation used in open-loop DBS to reach similar effects. The main advantages of open-source hardware include wide selection and availability, high customizability, and affordability. Our open-source closed-loop DBS system is effective, and warrants further research using open-source hardware for closed-loop neuromodulation.","Research Group Experimental Neurosurgery and Neuroanatomy, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; M3-BIORES: Measure, Model and Manage Bioresponses, Department of Biosystems, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84928391304&doi=10.1038%2fsrep09921&partnerID=40&md5=b904bb4fc1ed5f2eff6aa1ed90d4acfc,cited By 11,9921,10.1038/srep09921,,4,2015,Scientific Reports,Conceptualization and validation of an open-source closed-loop deep brain stimulation system in rat,"Wu, H. and Ghekiere, H. and Beeckmans, D. and Tambuyzer, T. and Van Kuyck, K. and Aerts, J.-M. and Nuttin, B.",article,Wu2015,,"anatomy and histology;  animal;  brain depth stimulation;  catalepsy;  cytology;  electrode implant;  electrostimulation;  hippocampus;  locomotion;  male;  mesencephalon reticular formation;  nerve cell;  physiology;  rat;  sensory feedback;  stereotactic procedure;  theta rhythm;  Wistar rat, Animals;  Deep Brain Stimulation;  Electric Stimulation;  Electrodes, Implanted;  Feedback, Sensory;  Freezing Reaction, Cataleptic;  Hippocampus;  Locomotion;  Male;  Midbrain Reticular Formation;  Neurons;  Rats;  Rats, Wistar;  Stereotaxic Techniques;  Theta Rhythm",,,,,

At least, they are if you define them in the usual way: an enterprise that provides documentation and permission sufficient for others to re-create, modify, improve, and even make their own versions of the devices it sells. And although open hardware has made strides in recent years-including an increasing number of companies adhering to these practices along with the establishment of the Open Source Hardware Association-it remains a niche industry. You might guess the reason to be simple-such companies must be set up and run by idealists who lack any hardheaded business sense. Not true! What's held back the opensource hardware movement is not a lack of business acumen; it's the rapid evolution of electronic technology. The reasons for this are subtle, but as I will explain below, swift advances in electronic technology inherently favor large closed businesses at the expense of small teams or individual innovators, who benefit most by working with open systems. At least that's the way things have been.

At the ‘thing’ level—devices and inter-device network communication—the core technical building blocks are generally the same as those found in wireless sensor network implementations. For the Internet of Things to continue growing, we need more plentiful resources for building intelligent devices and sensor networks. Unfortunately, current commercial devices, e.g., sensor nodes and network gateways, tend to be expensive and proprietary, which presents a barrier to entry and arguably slows down further development. There are, however, an increasing number of open embedded platforms available and also a wide selection of off-the-shelf components that can quickly and easily be built into device and network gateway solutions. The question is whether these solutions measure up to built-for-purpose devices. In the paper, we provide a comparison of existing built-for-purpose devices against open source devices. For comparison, we have also designed and rapidly prototyped a sensor node based on off-the-shelf components. We show that these devices compare favorably to built-for-purpose devices in terms of performance, power and cost. Using open platforms and off-the-shelf components would allow more developers to build intelligent devices and sensor networks, which could result in a better overall development ecosystem, lower barriers to entry and rapid growth in the number of IoT applications. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Advanced Sensor Networks Research Group, University of Pretoria, Lynwood Road, Pretoria, 0083, South Africa; Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, 83 Tat Chee Avenue, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong; Meraka Institute, Council for Scientific and Industrial Research South Africa, Meiring Naude Road, Pretoria, 0184, South Africa",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84928661924&doi=10.3390%2fs150306818&partnerID=40&md5=b7e9b64582018a5bc5808f404146e797,cited By 58,,10.3390/s150306818,3,15,2015,Sensors (Switzerland),Open hardware: A role to play in wireless sensor networks?,"Fisher, R. and Ledwaba, L. and Hancke, G. and Kruger, C.",article,Fisher20156818,,"Intelligent buildings;  Internet;  Internet of things;  Sensor nodes;  Wireless sensor networks, Commercial Devices;  Embedded platforms;  Industrial networks;  Intelligent devices;  Machine to machines;  Network communications;  Off-the-shelf components;  Smart grid, Gateways (computer networks)",Industrial networks;  Internet of Things;  Machine to machine;  Smart grid;  Wireless sensor network,6818-6844,,,

The drive towards smart cities has produced the need for smart sensors to be able to monitor what is happening in our cities. This, combined with the decrease in hardware component prices and the increase in the popularity of open hardware, has favored the deployment of sensor networks based on open hardware. The new trends in Internet Protocol (IP) communication between sensor nodes allow sensor access via the Internet, turning them into smart objects (Internet of Things and Web of Things). Currently, WSNs provide data in different formats. There is a lack of communication protocol standardization, which turns into interoperability issues when connecting different sensor networks or even when connecting different sensor nodes within the same network. This work presents a sensorized platform proposal that adheres to the principles of the Internet of Things and theWeb of Things. Wireless sensor nodes were built using open hardware solutions, and communications rely on the HTTP/IP Internet protocols. The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) SensorThings API candidate standard was used as a neutral format to avoid interoperability issues.

The ICE course at UFMS has been organized to encompass from initial basic concepts up to a practical and motivating set of experimental activities in order to clarify the program focus and to connect the concepts to practical applications. To evaluate the impacts of this new curriculum and methodology, an online anonymous survey has been carried out with students from 2011,2012, and 2013 classes. After a statistical analysis and validation of the answers, 28% of the students have pointed that the activities have been determinant to increase their motivation to study computer engineering.

Therefore, there has been demand for the development of a device that can measure the HOB angle continuously. In this paper, we propose the rapid prototyping of an HOB measurement system using open-source hardware and software. The proposed system helps to maintain the HOB angle at a particular angle by displaying the angle and helps the medical study of pneumonia patients by enabling continuous data acquisition. Firstly, we eliminate the process of making an MCU board by utilizing an open-source hardware mbed LPC1768. Secondly, we reduce the software development time by using libraries and hence enabling the easy use of peripherals. Thirdly, for rapid prototyping, we build the enclosure of the proposed system using a 3D printer. The proposed system can be attached and detached to and from a bed. Therefore, we can attach it to the bed of a patient for whom measurement of the HOB angle is necessary. Finally, we check the measurement performance and the validity of the proposed system through an experiment utilizing an incremental encoder. © ICROS 2015.","Department of Electrical Engineering, Inha University, South Korea",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84946721198&doi=10.5302%2fJ.ICROS.2015.15.0172&partnerID=40&md5=348cf9ee352538a3e301e7044066bec3,cited By 1,,10.5302/J.ICROS.2015.15.0172,11,21,2015,"Journal of Institute of Control, Robotics and Systems",Rapid prototyping of Head-of-Bed angle measurement system using open-source hardware,"Jo, B.-U. and Park, Y.-S. and Seo, S. and Kim, J.-G. and Lee, Y.-S.",article,Jo20151038,,"3D printers;  Data acquisition;  Hardware;  Open source software;  Rapid prototyping;  Software design, Head of bed;  Incremental encoder;  LPC1768;  Mbed;  Measurement system;  Medical studies;  Open-source hardwares;  Ventilator-associated pneumonia, Open systems",Head of bed;  LPC1768;  Mbed;  Open-source hardware;  Rapid prototyping,1038-1043,,,

Next, a hybrid control algorithm consisting of two components, namely model-based and PID algorithms, is proposed for surge speed, depth, and heading control. The effectiveness of the hybrid control algorithm is then verified by the ROV mathematical model-based simulations.

In this paper, we investigate a way of using the aforementioned AT equipments in order to access many different devices without assistive preferences. The solution takes advantage of open source hardware and its core component consists of an affordable Linux embedded system: it grabs data coming from the assistive software, which runs on the user's personal device, then, after processing, it generates native keyboard and mouse HID commands for the target computing device controlled by the end user. This process supports any operating system available on the target machine and it requires no specialized software installation; therefore the user with a disability can rely on a single assistive tool to control a wide range of computing platforms, including conventional computers and many kinds of mobile devices, which receive input commands through the USB HID protocol. © 2015 The authors and IOS Press.

There are differential current protective relays and directional distance protective relays from SEL, differential current protective relays from GE, and protective relays from Toshiba. The different relays each have different settings and maintenance modes, including those with the RS232 and RS485 serial ports and ASCII text command mode maintenance operations, those using the factory GUI utility to connect to the remote relay, to login, and to change the flag settings, those that use MODBUS protocol to communicate with remote intelligent devices, and those that exchange information with other substations using DNP3 protocol. A small portion of the old SEL devices include an FTP protocol mode to download flag situations. As learned from actual operating experience, as all protective relay flags are manually modified, it is impossible to judge whether they were modified properly until the time trip results are available when an accident occurs. Therefore, if the electrical protective relays at a substation were to be altered by unauthorized persons, supervisors have no method of detection.

818,Scopus,Conference Paper,ISEC - IEEE Integr. STEM Educ. Conf.,English,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"Timing is critical when trying to engage students in various engineering career paths. While many 'National Engineers Week' programs exist for primary and middle school students, there is a lack of hands on activities for students in the 9th-12th grades. It is often difficult to devise experiments for this age group that are interesting and not juvenile. Yet, it is during these crucial years that most students are lost to science, math and engineering. Engaging students and presenting opportunities for invention and excitement is important in the teen years, when peer pressure and the distractions of friends, social events, and activities are particularly high.1. There are a number of open source programming and affordable hardware platforms that can be used to implement low cost and interactive programs to promote innovation with various age groups. In this paper we share our work, as well as our learnings on how to make the workshops more effective. We have created various Arduino projects that can be customized to grade levels ranging from grades 7-12, and even college undergraduate students. The various projects we describe in this paper have been used to interact with students of different grade levels to engage in basic elements of engineering and computer programming. The classes should be set up to work in groups to promote shared innovation, teamwork and collaboration with peers. The open source and hardware experimenting exposed the students to various career paths ranging from software engineer, to electronic engineers and basic elements of various other engineering paths. This paper is designed to demonstrate the promotion of the engineering profession in schools through the use of Arduino Uno, Raspberry Pi Gemma kits, and Flora kits.

For knowledge? As cultural production has come to be characterized by contribution as well as consumption and as alternative modes of intellectual property transfer challenge the ‘dominant paradigm’ that knowledge and information should be protected and monetized, the logic of ‘open sourcing’ has extended into many cultural spheres. This article positions ‘openness’ as a value that intermediates between re-usable software code, institutional transparency, and expanded opportunities for participation in knowledge production cultures. By observing and analyzing the expansion of ‘openness’ from computer software to electronics hardware, we can develop a framework that identifies the tensions between socio-cultural visions of knowledge commons and the realities of governing those commons. This research focuses in particular on the knowledge related to electronics hardware and other material objects governed by open hardware licenses.

Large manufacturers will produce the platforms, and small companies will invent and produce modules that could be interfaced with the open-platform products.

A computer architecture course involves mainly the microprocessor structure and operation which constitutes the heart of the whole system. Due to microprocessor complexity, a number of simulation software solutions have been developed for supporting the corresponding courses. On the other hand, simulators offer only a visual environment where the students cannot change operational or structural characteristics for studying the corresponding microprocessor behavior. Moreover, and much more important is the fact that students cannot demystify the physical level where bit manipulation takes place. A novel and low cost approach for studying in depth microprocessor structure and operation at programming and hardware level is presented and finally proposed for the very first time in this paper. The student uses programmable hardware modules for developing the internal structure of a microprocessor.

The platform proposed here is intended for research which trades smaller population size with more sophisticated individual robot capabilities. The validation of proposed swarm robotic algorithms using real-world hardware is essential, but is fraught with difficulty due to the expense and complexity of developing and maintaining multiple operational units. A number of open hardware platforms have been pro- posed, although most prioritize small size and low cost over advanced capabilities such as vision. We are interested in a number of different research directions which utilize vision as a core capability and find the existing open hardware plat- forms to be insufficient (and existing commercial platforms too expensive). In this paper we describe a set of desirable characteristics for an open, extensible visually-guided robot platform. We then present our solution, the BuPiGo (pronounced buppy-go), describing the hardware itself and a model developed for simulation purposes.

Plant Computer Vision (PlantCV) was developed as open-source, hardware platform-independent software for quantitative image analysis. In a 4-week experiment, wild Setaria viridis and domesticated Setaria italica had fundamentally different temporal responses to water availability. While both lines produced similar levels of biomass under limited water conditions, Setaria viridis maintained the same water-use efficiency under water replete conditions, while Setaria italica shifted to less efficient growth. Overall, the Bellwether Phenotyping Platform and PlantCV software detected significant effects of genotype and environment on height, biomass, water-use efficiency, color, plant architecture, and tissue water status traits.

First, we summarize the range of current practices in wireless sensor network research projects by analyzing recent contributions in the literature. Specifically, for each wireless sensor network project, we compile details regarding the scope (e.g., simulation, testbed, real deployment), the type of mote used (e.g., TinyOS, Android, Arduino), and the type of sensors used (e.g., inertial, biological). Next, we discuss reasons why Arduino based wireless devices are perhaps the future of applied wireless sensor network research. Arduino-based systems are inexpensive, easy to use, readily available, well documented, 100% open-source (hardware and software), object oriented, extendable (using the 'shield' concept), and flexible (e.g., in terms of radio choices).

For its implementation, we develop 7 input and output blocks for use with Simulink, all of which are implemented from a single S-function. We also propose a method through which we can overcome the problem arising when the sampling time of the control system is not constant. The proposed RCP system has several advantages over existing methods such as good maintainability, portability due to the USB interface, low cost, and no necessity for C-code generation even though it can only be applied to control systems with moderate sampling rates.

The control design approach illustrates a viable way of migrating from an industrial PC-based MPC technology to an embedded platform. This work also provides the transformations and the real-time considerations necessary to achieve a functional high-performance predictive controller on a low-cost embedded hardware, with limited computational resources. The eMPC was implemented for rapid prototyping on the Ethernut 5 open-source hardware, and its performance was tested for a simulated process. The concept was tested using a real MPC application developed for a prototype of a new industrial process that requires an advanced embedded multivariable, constraint handling control solution. The results confirm the viability of the embedded MPC design approach. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Involving from one side concept of social situatedness and connectedness, and from another the concept of independent, self-directed and self-regulated student learning, the project was based on assembling the mini-lab, Radiation Sensor Board for Arduino, that was originally designed to help people in Japan to measure levels of radiation in their everyday life after the Fukushima accident. As it was reported elsewhere, this product was an example of crowdsourcing. When Libelien designed the Radiation Sensor Board for Waspmote, the idea was simple: with the Arduino platform people will be able to have easily running their own detector at home while on the other hand with Waspmote platform authorities will be able to deploy autonomous sensor networks to send the radiation levels from dangerous areas using wireless sensor platform ZigBee and GPRS technologies. This paper present students developing project where the Sensor Board for Arduino was used as assembling, teaching tool. The Do-It-Yourself and Internet of Things can be used both in educational, and in the research and development purposes. Owning their own mini-lab at their disposal anytime, students worked at their learning speed. It also boosted the interest, confidence of students and highly affected three domains of learning: cognitive domain (activities like instrumentation, modeling, experimentation, data analysis and design, psychomotor domain (activities like manipulating the apparatus, sensory awareness) and affective domain (behavior and attitudes to learn from failure, creativity, collaborative communication, safety and ethics in the laboratory). We show that networking learning, supported by hands-on labs on chip, and an open source electronics prototyping platform as Arduino and Raspberry Pi, give great opportunities for teaching and learning the tinkering and inventing skills, an request we have to deal with it at the University of Montenegro. Such project support exploratory and serendipitous learning. It moved teching from an emphasis simply on linear logic and programmed instruction, towards non-linear, networked, branching, hypertext views of learning, in which connections between knowledge are made and developed. It is based on principle of situated cognition and Vigotskian thought: situatedness, commonality, interdependency and infrastructure where learning is fascinated by an activity.

With about 3.5 billion subscribers, GSM remains as the de facto standard for cellular communications. However, the security criteria envisioned 30 years ago, when the standard was designed, are no longer sufficient to ensure the security and privacy of the users. Furthermore, even with the newest fourth generation (4G) cellular technologies starting to be deployed, these networks could never achieve strong security guarantees because the MNOs keep backwards- compatibility given the huge amount of GSM subscribers. In this paper, we present and describe the tools and necessary steps to perform an active attack against a GSM-compatible network, by exploiting the GSM protocol lack of mutual authentication between the subscribers and the network. The attack consists of a so-called man-in-the- middle attack implementation. By using Software Defined Radio (SDR), open-source libraries and open- source hardware, we setup a fake GSM base station to impersonate the network and therefore eavesdrop any communications that are being routed through it and extract information from their victims.

The control layer, in particular, is based on a cascade control algorithm able to globally stabilize the position and the attitude of the vehicle. The global property guaranteed by the algorithm allows the quadrotors to perform aggressive maneuvers.

In a view to suppress the limitations and inaccuracies of the existing methods, a new concept is successfully implemented. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and state-of-the-art electronic circuitry are embedded to realize an automatic measurement system based on an open-source computing platform. Moreover, to facilitate user interaction with the system, a sophisticated graphical user interface (GUI) is created. This system, from both the hardware and software perspective, brings new ideas in, not only the moisture content determination test, but in geotechnical engineering laboratory and field instrumentation in terms of accuracy, automation, and machine intelligence. It will be obvious from this work that open-source hardware and software embedded in test equipment can automate the whole test procedure for almost all types of tests in geotechnical engineering using appropriate sensor, and data-acquisition and processing routines. This paper presents the technical know-how of the system setup, hardware, and software development, workflow, and system validation for the determination of moisture content of subgrade soil in two distinct test modes - supervised and unsupervised.

From the point of view of design culture, humanoid artifacts, are at the intersection of product design, visual communication, and interaction design. The release of open hardware platforms, such as Arduino Robot, as well as the diffusion of fabrication laboratories (fablabs) and open design practices are the early manifestations of a wider interest toward social robotics accompanied by the possibility of building working prototypes of humanoid artifacts. The use of human face as interface in human–computer interaction adds analogic content to interaction processes in an unmediated and unobtrusive way, transferring human-computer interaction to the field of interpersonal communication. Nevertheless, the field of anthropomorphic artifacts is generally neglected by designers and rather controlled by engineers and experimental psychologists.

Syst., ICIIS",English,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"The prime objective of any technological innovation is to improve the life of people. Technological innovation in the field of medical devices directly touches the lives of millions of people; not just patients but doctors and other technicians as well. Serving these care givers is serving humanity. Growth of Mobil Devices and Cloud Computing has changed the way we live and work. We try to bring the benefits of these technological innovations to the medical field via equipment which can improve the working efficiencies and capabilities of the medical professionals and technicians. The improvements in the camera and image processing capabilities of the Mobile Devices coupled with their improved processing power and an infinite processing and storage offered by Cloud Computing infrastructure opens up a window of opportunity to use them in the specialized field like microsurgery. To enable microsurgery, surgeons use optical microscope to zoom into the working area to get better visibility and control. However, these devices suffer from various drawbacks and are not comfortable to use. We build a Tablet with large stereoscopic screen allowing glasses free 3D display enabled by cameras capable of capturing 3D video and enhanced by an image processing pipeline, greatly improves the visibility and viewing comfort of the surgeon. Moreover using the capabilities of Cloud computing, these surgeries can be recorded and streamed live for education, training and consultation. An expert sitting in a geographically remote location can guide the surgeon performing the surgery. All vital parameters of the patient undergoing surgery can be shown as an overlay on the Tablet screen so that the surgeon is alerted of any parameter going beyond limit. Developing this kind of complex device involves engineering skills in hardware and software and huge amount of investments in terms of time, resources and money. To accelerate the development, we make use of open source hardware and software and demonstrate how we can accelerate the development using these open source resources. © 2014 IEEE.","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering, Bangalore University, Bangalore, 560 001, India; Chaos Labs, India; Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84924233677&doi=10.1109%2fICIINFS.2014.7036534&partnerID=40&md5=c918e942ad380c060e6b1a6605a11767,cited By 7,7036534,10.1109/ICIINFS.2014.7036534,,,2015,"9th International Conference on Industrial and Information Systems, ICIIS 2014",Cloud enabled 3D tablet design for medical applications,"Kiran, S.V. and Prasad, R. and Thriveni, J. and Venugopal, K.R. and Patnaik, L.M.",conference,Kiran2015,,"Biomedical equipment;  Cameras;  Cloud computing;  Distributed computer systems;  End effectors;  Hardware;  Image processing;  Investments;  Medical applications;  Mobile devices;  Open source software;  Open systems;  Optical data processing;  Pipeline processing systems;  Stereo image processing;  Surgery;  Systems analysis;  Video signal processing;  Visibility, 3-D videos;  Android;  Multi-core processor;  Open sources;  Tablet, Mobile cloud computing",3D video;  Android;  Mobile cloud computing;  Multicore processor;  Open source;  Sterescopic display;  System design;  Tablet,,9781479964994,"Kumar S., Arya K.V.",

Sci.,English,,0948695X,IICM,,"Safety-critical systems and certification standards are the bare essential elements for the development process of avionics, automotive and industrial embedded systems. The necessity of including non-safety capabilities to reduce the price of these systems has resulted in a new type of critical systems, the mixed-criticality ones. These systems should be able to execute safety-critical applications but, at the same time, to run non-safety-critical functionalities without affecting the integrity of the safety-critical tasks. This paper presents a new system architecture which includes safety- critical and non-safety-critical parts in order to form a mixed-criticality system. The system consists of a reliable platform with a dual-core processor (implemented using a FPGA) architecture designed as open-hardware, running two isolated real time oper ating systems which are connected through a safe core-to-core communication channel that executes the safety-critical applications. Moreover, the safety-critical system is connected to an external processor, an ARM9, which is used as an external sensing system. The ARM9 runs the non-safety-critical applications and allows the system to insert modifications updating without affecting the safety capabilities of the safety- critical part. This platform is described providing evidences of the isolation between safety-critical (SC) and non-safety-critical (NSC) applications, as well as describing an updating methodology for non-safety-critical applications.

Proc.",Spanish,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"Technological devices of all kinds are becoming more common in our daily lives: smart devices are being incorporated in buildings, houses, cars, and public infrastructure such as roads and bridges. The new devices give us an unusual degree of connectivity in our regular activities, for example when we employ our tablets or smart phones to check email or browse the public network, but also in more innovative forms of connectivity, such as receiving notifications directly from our refrigerator or collecting information from our clothes and shoes. This technological revolution brings new opportunities and challenges for users, businesses, and society. This paper explores such a new context, where we begin to co-exist and interact with a network of interconnected devices that is known as the Internet of Things. The objective of the project is to implement a solution for communicating devices that monitor, in real-time, the structural health of a bridge. The implementation is based on 6LoWPAN, a standard based on the IPv6 protocol over low-power and lossy networks to support the Internet of Things. We employ open hardware platforms and emphasize the singularities of embedded systems, such as a limited number of operations, low power consumption, and low bandwidth capability.

Proc.,English,,1095323X,IEEE Computer Society,,"In 2015 NASA plans to launch a payload to 280 Km altitude on a sounding rocket from the Wallops Flight Facility. This payload will contain several novel technologies that work together to demonstrate methodologies for space sample return missions and for nanosatellite communications in general. The payload will deploy and test an Exo-Brake, which slows the payload aerodynamically, providing eventual de-orbit and recovery of future ISS samples through a Small Payload Quick Return project. In addition, this flight addresses future Mars mission entry technology, space-to-space communications using the Iridium Short Messaging Service (SMS), GPS tracking, and wireless sensors using the ZigBee protocol. SOAREX-8 is being assembled and tested at Ames Research Center (ARC) and the NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC) is funding sensor and communications work. Open source Arduino technology and software are used for system control. The ZigBee modules used are XBee units that connect analog sensors for temperature, air pressure and acceleration measurement wirelessly to the payload telemetry system. Our team is developing methods for power distribution and module mounting, along with software for sensor integration, data assembly and downlink. We have demonstrated relaying telemetry to the ground using the Iridium satellite constellation on a previous flight, but the upcoming flight will be the first time we integrate useful flight test data from a ZigBee wireless sensor network. Wireless sensor data will measure the aerodynamic efficacy of the Exo-Brake permitting further onorbit flight tests of improved designs. The Exo-Brake is 5 m2 in area and will be stored in a container and deployed during ascent once the payload is jettisoned from the launch vehicle. We intend to further refine the hardware and continue testing on balloon launches, future sounding rocket flights and on nanosatellite missions. The use of standards-based and opensource hardware/software has allowed for this project to be completed with a very modest budget and a challenging schedule. There is a wealth of hardware and software available for both the Arduino platform and the XBee, all low-cost or open-source. Along with the Exo-Brake hardware and deployment discussion, this paper will describe in detail the system architecture emphasizing the successful use of opensource hardware and software to minimize effort and cost. Testing procedures, radio frequency interference (RFI) mitigation, success criteria and expected results will also be discussed.

Piaggio University of Pisa, Largo Lucio Lazzarino 1, Italy; email: g.vozzi@centropiaggio.unipi.it","In the last decades drop-on-demand inkjet technology played an increasing role in industrial and medical applications. This is due to the ability to deposit a small amount of material in precisely defined position. In the field of Biofabrication, inkjet printers are used to build 2D and 3D scaffolds and gels with biological molecules, including living cells. Several works, including seminal papers on inkjet bioprinting, were carried out with modified office printers. These printers have fixed structural characteristics and operating size, especially on the print-head, limiting the range of materials that can be dispensed. The aim of the present work is the design and fabrication of an open-source piezoelectric inkjet print-head, optimized for the bioprinting field. This low-cost, reproducible, reliable, versatile and biocompatible device will enable various research laboratories to work with a shared device; the open source allowing for parts to be modified to suit specific needs. The design was carried out by Finite Element (FE) modeling of the piezoelectric, mechanical, fluid dynamics and their coupling. The design was optimized for shear rate, which we minimized in order to be able to print cells. The mechanical frame of the printer was designed and built using a low-cost 3D printer. The nozzle plate was fabricated from a polycarbonate disc coated with biocompatible silicone, to increase the hydrophobicity of the outer surface of the disc, preventing ink adhesion on the edge of the nozzle; the refilling system, and the electronic control were also part of the project and will be freely available to download. The FE models were validated with ad-hoc experiments, printing water, gelatin solution, and cell culture media, by modulating the wave power in amplitude, frequency and duty cycle. The tests showed a large working window both respect to viscosity and to surface tension. Finally Human Skin Fibroblasts (ATCC-CRL-2522, Teddington UK), suspended in culture media, were printed. Cell viability, assessed by CellTiter-Blue and LIVE / DEAD tests, resulted comparable with the control, demonstrating the validity of the first open source piezoelectric inkjet print-head for biofabrication. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Research Center E.

861,Scopus,Article,J. Inst. Telecommun. Prof.,English,,17559278,Institute of Telecommunications Professionals,,"There are many potential applications in the utilities, critical infrastructure monitoring and control and environmental monitoring. This article charts the device-level technologies used in the creation the IoT, including hardware, software and communications. IoT's emergence coincided with the development of radio frequency identification (RFID) technology offering advantages such as the communicable range, ability to write data to a tag, and the possibility of reading multiple tags more efficiently with a single reader. RFID is now just one of many component IoT technologies. We have arrived at a situation where it is practically trivial to integrate computation and communication into any manufactured thing, and it is equally feasible to connect and technologically perceive natural things using communicable sensors. Furthermore, it is possible to react to, and control the environment using embedded computing devices coupled with actuators. Thorough comprehension of functional and non-functional requirements is necessary to develop an effective, efficient design specification for an IoT device. But given the large design space and complexity, there are numerous barriers to entry. As a result, many types of device have been adopted as practical de facto hardware development platforms across research communities, anc hacker and maker communities. In each case, intermediary 'operating systems', designed to simplify their programming by masking hardware complexity, are typically used. Their technical specifications are often not fully disclosed, but they do rely on well- defined standards to ensure the necessary interoperability. The majority of devices are characterised as single board computers. The final design for a market-ready product will likely be as efficient and cost-effective as possible in terms of design, but include sufficient redundancy to support software updates and potential shifts in standards. Since the early 2000s, the wireless sensor network community has worked with highly constrained devices characterised by limited energy, storage, communications, packet loss, etc. Incremental improvement! to hardware components have led to net energy efficiency improvements, increased computation for equivalent or less energy, more storage, etc. Algorithms and protocol! have been developed to further improve efficiency and reliability. The 'maker' movements have focused on open source hardware whereas those on the educationa side have sought to reduce the barriers to entry in terms of cost and simplification, e.g. the Raspberry Pi. Industrialists have increasingly tended to incorporate monitoring systems into their operations. Cellular connectivity has also been adopted and both are now converging on IoT. Although wireless connectivity has been central to the development of many IoT standards, devices with wired connections can also be part of the IoT. Indeed, many standards relevant to IoT are designed independent of the particular physical communications medium enabling seamless interoperability at higher layers and easing connectivity concerns in integrated applications. A number of approaches exist to developing software for IoT devices. As the computing power available increases, the ease with which one may programme the device tends to improve. The fewer resources that are available, the closer the software developer must get to the hardware. To reduce the complexity of programming devices, operating systems and associated programming languages have been designed or adapted to suit the embedded environment. Considering the more computationally powerful single board computers, certain flavours of Linux have been developed. High-end boards with significant processing capabilities are capable of running full-blown operating systems. Recently, mobile operating systems, such as Android, have been used, and stripped down versions have been touted by the big developers. From a devices perspective, it is easier than ever to connect a sensor, a controller, or a mundane household item to the Internet. On the other hand, there are still significant challenges to be overcome. With regard to industrial applications with strict performance requirements, multiple constraints, and often-difficult operational environments, work is far from complete.","Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, United Kingdom",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84958766701&partnerID=40&md5=2e2f20c6f0037b4636b9cfa47e1c9daf,cited By 1,,,4,9,2015,Journal of the Institute of Telecommunications Professionals,Devices in the internet of things,"Boyle, D. and Kolcun, R. and Yeatman, E.",article,Boyle201526,,"Competition;  Complex networks;  Computational efficiency;  Computer hardware;  Computer operating systems;  Computer software;  Cost effectiveness;  Design;  Digital storage;  Embedded systems;  Energy efficiency;  Hardware;  Internet;  Interoperability;  Open source software;  Open systems;  Personal computing;  Product design;  Radio frequency identification (RFID);  Reconfigurable hardware;  Specifications;  Standards;  Wireless sensor networks, Efficiency and reliability;  Embedded computing devices;  Infrastructure monitoring;  Non-functional requirements;  Operational environments;  Performance requirements;  Radio frequency identification technology;  Technical specifications, Internet of things",,26-31,,,

Explored are the various methods that can be utilized to improve the percentage of STEM majors in the American educational system with resources such as: Open Source as Alternative (OSALT), virtualization, cloud computing, Linux distributions, open source programming, and open source hardware platforms. Increasing the amount of students that pursue STEM majors is important because the projected job growth in the STEM field compared to non-STEM jobs is 33%. OSALT provides cost-effective alternatives to commercial products such as Microsoft Office Suite and Adobe Photoshop. Second, creating Virtual Machines (VMs) is another avenue to teach complex concepts in computer science, engineering, and Information Technology (IT). Third, cloud computing is an inexpensive way for clients to access information from multiple locations and devices. Fourth, universities can use the Operating System (OS) Linux and its various distributions as replacements for commercial operating systems like Windows in order to reduce IT costs.

The cost of instrumentation, however, limits measurement frequency and number of sensors. The objective of this work was to design a low cost ―open hardware‖ platform for multi-sensor measurements including water content at different depths, air and soil temperatures. The system is based on an open-source ARDUINO microcontroller-board, programmed in a simple integrated development environment (IDE). Low cost high-frequency dielectric probes were used in the platform and lab tested on three non-saline soils (ECe1: 2.5 &lt; 0.1 mS/cm). Empirical calibration curves were subjected to cross-validation (leave-one-out method), and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) were respectively 0.09 for the overall model, 0.09 for the sandy soil, 0.07 for the clay loam and 0.08 for the sandy loam. The overall model (pooled soil data) fitted the data very well (R2 = 0.89) showing a high stability, being able to generate very similar RMSEs during training and validation (RMSEtraining = 2.63; RMSEvalidation = 2.61). Data recorded on the card were automatically sent to a remote server allowing repeated field-data quality checks.

Therefore, the need for a suitable open source system that can be used as a prototype platform to test new network functionality while ensuring line-rate processing, accurate timestamping, and reduced power consumption has become evident. All these requirements cannot be achieved by using software-only solutions, but rather with hardware-based platforms such as NetFPGA. The main obstacle when using this type of open source FPGA-based solution is the cost of development, in both time and hardware development skills required. The spread of new circuit synthesis tools using high-level languages opens the door for the development of hardwarebased networking applications with reasonable development effort, compared to the use of traditional hardware description languages. In this article, we describe how existing open source hardware-based platforms for networking applications will be fueled by the change in the programming model of FPGAs provided by modern high-level synthesis tools. For this, we implemented a network flow monitor using high-level languages and compared the effort spent with respect to a traditional hardware development cycle.

Methods,English,24286701,01650270,Elsevier,"Rorden, C.; Department of Psychology, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC 290208, United States; email: Rorden@sc.edu","Background: Many neuroscience experiments rely on presenting stimuli and measuring participants' responses to these events. Often computer screens, speakers and keyboards are sufficient. However, these devices are not appropriate for some situations. For example, some studies present tactile or olfactory stimuli or brain stimulation. Likewise, keyboard buttons are not appropriate for use with vocal responses, small animals or individuals with motor impairments. New method: We describe StimSync, which simulates USB keyboard inputs, allowing use with most experimental software. StimSync can measure button presses, optical signals from magnetic resonance imaging systems, changes in ambient light (e.g. synchronizing intracranial electrography), and auditory events (a voice key). In addition to the USB keyboard mode (necessarily millisecond precision), StimSync can also be set to provide higher precision timing. This feature can be used to validate timing, ensuring event synchronization (e.g. auditory events, visual events, brain stimulation). In addition to recording inputs, StimSync provides seven digital outputs for controlling external devices. Finally, StimSync can record analog inputs; we illustrate how this can be used to evaluate the rise time for computer displays. Results: We observed outputs with a mean latency of 2.1. ms (sd=. 0.17. ms) and USB inputs with a mean latency of 2. ms (sd=. 0.54. ms). Comparison with existing method(s): StimSync statistically outperforms two professional solutions and numerically outperforms other devices described in the literature. Conclusions: StimSync (http://www.mccauslandcenter.sc.edu/CRNL/tools/stimsync) provides an open-source solution for controlling and validating neuroscience experiments. In addition to sharing the design, we have produced a batch of devices to demonstrate the market for professional implementations. © 2014.","Department of Psychology, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC 290208, United States; McCausland Center for Brain Imaging, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC 290208, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84896052839&doi=10.1016%2fj.jneumeth.2013.11.017&partnerID=40&md5=8573123304b4ba579f01102104081f5e,cited By 3,,10.1016/j.jneumeth.2013.11.017,,227,2014,Journal of Neuroscience Methods,StimSync: Open-source hardware for behavioral and MRI experiments,"Rorden, C. and Hanayik, T.",article,Rorden201490,JNMED,"article;  brain depth stimulation;  cathode ray tube;  comparative study;  computer;  computer mouse;  computer program;  fiber optics;  functional magnetic resonance imaging;  keyboard;  light emitting diode;  measurement accuracy;  microphone;  nuclear magnetic resonance imaging;  nuclear magnetic resonance scanner;  oscilloscope;  priority journal;  vision;  animal;  behavior;  brain;  devices;  human;  image processing;  nuclear magnetic resonance imaging;  physiology;  procedures;  reaction time;  reproducibility, Animals;  Behavior;  Brain;  Computers;  Humans;  Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;  Magnetic Resonance Imaging;  Reaction Time;  Reproducibility of Results;  Software",Custom response device;  Human and animal responses;  Magnetic resonance imaging;  Motor-evoked potential;  Open source hardware;  Stimulus synchronization,90-99,,,

Open source processes are fundamentally different because they are driven by evolutionary processes, as compared to traditional hierarchical design processes. Hence, a critical driving factor for their success is the ability to use and to make improvements and modifications over existing designs. Making modifications in simple products, where the changes in one aspect of the product do not propagate to other aspects, is relatively easier than in complex products. Currently, such modifications are difficult to perform on complex hardware products, thereby limiting the evolution of open source hardware products.

Before the tape-out, a pre-silicon design has to be thoroughly inspected by time-consuming functional verification and code review to exclude bugs. For functional verification and code review, a critical issue determining their efficiency is the allocation of resources (e.g., computational resources and manpower) to different modules of a design, which is conventionally guided by designers' experiences. Such practices, though simple and straightforward, may take high risks of wasting resources on bug-free modules or missing bugs in buggy modules, and thus could affect the success and timeline of the tape-out. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called pre-silicon bug forecast to predict the bug information of hardware designs. In this framework, bug models are built via machine learning techniques to characterize the relationship between design characteristics and the bug information, which can be leveraged to predict how bugs distribute in different modules of the current design. Such predicted bug information is adequate to regulate the resources among different modules to achieve efficient functional verification and code review. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed pre-silicon bug forecast framework, we conducted detailed experiments on several open-source hardware projects. Moreover, we also investigate the impacts of different learning techniques and different sets of characteristic on the performance of bug models. Experimental results show that with appropriate learning techniques and characteristics, about 90% modules could be correctly predicted as buggy or clean and the number of bugs of each module could also be accurately predicted. © 2013 IEEE.","State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100190, China; Anhui USTC IFLYTEK Company, Ltd., Heifei, 230088, China; University of Science and Technology of China, Heifei, 230027, China",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84897641299&doi=10.1109%2fTCAD.2013.2288688&partnerID=40&md5=f2802073fc8caa28c47a76501efb450d,cited By 4,6740024,10.1109/TCAD.2013.2288688,3,33,2014,IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems,Pre-silicon bug forecast,"Guo, Q. and Chen, T. and Chen, Y. and Wang, R. and Chen, H. and Hu, W. and Chen, G.",article,Guo2014451,ITCSD,"Code review;  Computational resources;  Critical issues;  Design characteristics;  Functional verification;  Learning techniques;  Machine learning techniques;  Open-source hardwares, Design;  Hardware;  Learning algorithms;  Learning systems;  Silicon, Forecasting",Bug forecast;  code review;  design characteristics;  functional verification;  machine learning,451-463,,,

The design implementation of the proof of concept employs open-source hardware architecture using Arduino and off-the-shelf sensors which lends itself to mass production, low cost and easy maintenance. This system is intended to service rural and low income urban consumers who will not be able to afford existing sophisticated and expensive home automation systems. A device identification module (DIM) that recognizes the devices in use at every room is implemented. The energy usage is continuously monitored and the user is notified of his consumption over a twenty four hour period. As many of the intended users are possible first time energy consumers, the energy monitoring system will inculcate a sense of energy consciousness and ensure grass root level sustainability. The energy consumption data is logged in the system and can be used by the utility service provider (USP) for future system planning, optimization and demand side management. The proof of concept developed and tested under laboratory conditions costs under USD 11 and will reduce further on commercialization. © 2014 IEEE.","Dept. of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Sri Venkateswara College of Engineering, Sriperumbudur, India; Dept. of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Sri Venkateswara College of Engineering, Sriperumbudur, India; Dept. of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, SMK Fomra Institute of Technology, Chennai, India; Solarillion Foundation, Chennai, India; Research and Outreach, Solarillion Foundation, Chennai, India",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84946685851&doi=10.1109%2fSusTech.2014.7046232&partnerID=40&md5=e62eebba51d6550c79ae718c520dcd86,cited By 5,7046232,10.1109/SusTech.2014.7046232,,,2014,"2014 IEEE Conference on Technologies for Sustainability, SusTech 2014",Low-cost non-intrusive residential energy monitoring system,"Ravishankar, A. and Vignesh, A. and Vel, V. and Dhiwaakar Purusothaman, S.R.R. and Vijayaraghavan, V.",conference,Ravishankar2014130,,"Automation;  Consumer behavior;  Costs;  Electric current measurement;  Electric load management;  Electric utilities;  Energy utilization;  Information management;  Open systems;  Sustainable development, Demand side managements;  Design implementation;  Energy consumption datum;  Energy monitoring system;  Home automation systems;  Laboratory conditions;  Open-source hardwares;  Utility service providers, Monitoring",consumer behaviour;  current measurement;  energy consumption;  load management;  monitoring,130-134,9781479952380,,

A modular, platform-based, approach is the way to obtain this result. Modular approaches are common for software development, but hardware is still crafted often re-inventing solutions every time. As a consequence, the resources that should be invested in the development of a new robot get often drained by the implementation of a physical, working prototype to test the application idea. To overcome this problem, we propose R2P (Rapid Robot Prototyping), a framework to implement real-time, high-quality architectures for robotic systems with off-the-shelf basic modules (e.g., sensors, actuators, and controllers), integrating hardware and software, which can be assembled in a plug-and-play way.

R2P aims at dramatically reduce time and efforts required to build a prototype robot, making it possible to focus the resources on the development of new robotic applications instead of struggling on their implementation. This enables also people with experience in a specific application domain, but with little technical background, to actively participate in the development of new robotic applications. R2P is open-source both in its software and hardware to promote its diffusion among the robotics community and novel business models that will substantially reduce the costs to design a new robotic product. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Excepting a small and relatively well-understood minority, we can see that the world around us consists of a multitude of colors; yet, describing the ""what"", ""why"", and ""how"" of these colors is not an easy task, especially without some sort of equally colorful visual aids. While static displays (e.g., poster boards, etc.) serve their purpose, there is a growing trend, aided by the recent permeation of small interactive devices into our society, for interactive and immersive learning. However, for the uninitiated, designing software and hardware for this purpose may not be within the purview of all optical scientists and engineers. Enter open source. Open source ""anything"" are those tools and designs-hardware or software-that are available and free to use, often without any restrictive licensing. Open source software may be familiar to some, but the open source hardware movement is relatively new. These are electronic circuit board designs that are provided for free and can be implemented in physical hardware by anyone. This movement has led to the availability of some relatively inexpensive, but quite capable, computing power for the creation of small devices. This paper will showcase the design and implementation of the software and hardware that was used to create an interactive demonstration kit for color.

A vertebrate's behaviors like focusing attention, cautious risk-aversion and curiosity-seeking exploration are influenced by these neuromodulators. The paper presents an autonomous robotic control approach based on vertebrate neuromodulation and its implementation on multiple open-source hardware platforms. A simple neural network is used to model the neuromodulatory functions for generating context based behavioral responses to sensory signals. The neural network incorporates three types of neurons-attention focusing cholinergic and noradrenergic (ACh/NE), curiosity-seeking dopaminergic (DA), and risk aversive serotonergic (5-HT) neurons. The implementation of the neuronal model on multiple relatively simple autonomous robots is illustrated through the interesting behavior of the robots adapting to changes in the environment.

The microgrid control and coordination infrastructure has been realized as a hierarchical multi-agent system (MAS) comprising of the DG agents, the Mu agent and the D agent. The Communication (Mu) Agent acts as a link between the lower-level microgrid agents (distributed energy resources (DERs), the load, the storage and the utility grid) which provide the required digital parameter inputs, and the Control Agent comprising of the Cloud. Data storage, analytics and control commands are generated based on the rule engine updates given by the Utility Service Provider (USP) to the Cloud. The microgrid side input data are converted into appropriate GPRS signals within the Arduino. The specific functions that enable this conversion are elucidated as pseudocode. Further, the cloud control commands are sent back to the various microgrid-side agents via the Mu agent as GPRS signals.

A sensor based glove for recognition of the gestures in the American Sign Language (ASL) is the input module to the system. It incorporates resistive flex sensors and contact sensors appropriately positioned to obtain a theoretical efficiency of 96% in character recognition. When the sensors are subjected to change in orientation by the user, the variation in electrical resistance of each of the individual sensors is obtained as the input to an Arduino ATMega328 microcontroller that accurately maps it to the letters of the English alphabet through an efficient algorithm. An elegant methodology that is easy to implement using a microcontroller is employed for the mapping process to minimize the complexity of the system. The paper also presents a detailed study of the efficiency characteristics involved in the construction of the custom-designed flex sensors utilized in the system.

Any up-gradation of the hardware in the existing communication devices is not easier one. Compatibility of the new hardware with existing hardware is highly essential. But the new protocols may or may not support the older one. The solution for these problems can be provided by using the reconfigurable hardware design. The hardware can be reprogrammed according to the new change in technology up-gradation. The cost of commercially available hardware and software requirements for setting up such a module is very high. This can be solved by using Open source hardware and software such as Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) and GNU Radio. This work demonstrates how the modern analog communication system like Community Radio Schemes and Radio Data System (RDS) and digital communication systems such as Simple Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) and OFDM based data communication can be developed using the Open source hardware USRP1.

Nevertheles, its implementation on devices with low computing power remains a practical challenge. Industrial controllers, such as programmable logic controllers, or modern, low cost controller hardware, such as the Arduino or the Raspberry Pi open source hardware proposals, lack both the on-board memory and the high speed data acquisition hardware to perform an accurate spectral analysis of the machine's current, in order to identify the spectral components produced by each type of fault. In this paper, a signal conditioning unit, based on a novel downsampling method of the current, is presented. This unit reduces the amount of current samples that must be processed by the diagnostic unit to a mere sample per current cycle, maintains the sub-hertz accuracy needed to resolve fault, and converts the mains component into a constant value that can be easily eliminated without using any additional filter. Besides, it is implemented using low cost devices, just resistors and operational amplifiers. The proposed method is theoretically developed in this paper, and it has been validated using induction motors with broken bars fed directly by the mains or through variable speed drives. © 2014 IEEE.","Department of Electrical Engineering, Universitat Politècnica de València, Camino de Vera s/n, Valencia, 46022, Spain",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84916231848&doi=10.1109%2fICELMACH.2014.6960383&partnerID=40&md5=da1192a3582b6d71653df0e6669c48aa,cited By 3,6960383,10.1109/ICELMACH.2014.6960383,,,2014,"Proceedings - 2014 International Conference on Electrical Machines, ICEM 2014",Condition monitoring of electrical machines using low computing power devices,"Sapena-Bano, A. and Perez-Cruz, J. and Pineda-Sanchez, M. and Puche-Panadero, R. and Roger-Folch, J. and Riera-Guasp, M. and Martinez-Roman, J.",conference,Sapena-Bano20141516,,"Computation theory;  Condition monitoring;  Controllers;  Cost benefit analysis;  Data acquisition;  Digital storage;  Electric fault currents;  Electric machinery;  Failure analysis;  Fourier transforms;  Hardware;  Induction motors;  Machine components;  Open systems;  Operational amplifiers;  Programmable logic controllers;  Programmed control systems;  Signal detection;  Signal processing;  Spectrum analysis;  Variable speed drives, Broken rotor bar;  Current signature analysis;  High speed data acquisition;  Industrial controllers;  Industrial maintenance;  Open-source hardwares;  Park vectors;  Spectral components, Fault detection",Broken rotor bar detection;  Condition monitoring;  Extended Park Vector;  Fault diagnosis;  Fourier transforms;  Induction motor;  Motor-current signature analysis;  Programmable logic controllers;  Signal processing,1516-1522,9781479943890,,

Having access to education and the means of production appears as the major factors for the implementation of this goal. 3D printing is a revolutionary technology that has the potential to bring digital manufacturing to everyone. However, the rise of personal fabrication requires an increase in printing quality, a reduction on machine cost and an increase in knowledge shared by the open hardware community. The purpose of this paper is to explore the development of a new Open Hardware printer project to address these points. Design/methodology/approach: The authors have designed and constructed a low-cost photopolymer-based 3D printer called BeamMaker. The printer is connected to a host computer and a digital-light-processing projector. This work details the design process and how improvements were implemented to reach good printing quality. The authors provide public access to the instructions, software, source code, parts list, user manual and STL and CAD files. Findings: The BeamMaker printer can build objects with a high surface quality that is comparable to the quality obtained by industrial photopolymer-based 3D printers. When testing the ability to print a sample cylinder, the printer shows higher accuracy when compared to other personal 3D printers. These findings are encouraging considering the low cost of the system. Research limitations/implications: The printing failure rate of the system has not been measured to date. The system requires some improvements to produce large objects. Practical implications: The printer cost is just USD380. This is five to eight times less expensive than popular personal 3D printers available today. The cost is 30 times less expensive than a personal photopolymer 3D printer produced by a main commercial company and yet producing results of similar quality. The authors expect good avenues for collaboration from the open-source community to continue improving these systems. Social implications: The high cost of current personal 3D printers prevents users from developing countries from entering into the open hardware trend. A dramatic reduction in printer cost such as that explored in this work might contribute to the real democratization of personal fabrication. Originality/value: The authors report on the status of three other photopolymer-based personal 3D printer projects. To the best of the authors' knowledge, BeamMaker is the first fully open hardware 3D printer project which uses this technology. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84901017027&doi=10.1108%2fRPJ-01-2013-0006&partnerID=40&md5=41b1a65786a562276732649f634eac65,cited By 9,17111237,10.1108/RPJ-01-2013-0006,3,20,2014,Rapid Prototyping Journal,BeamMaker: An open hardware high-resolution digital fabricator for the masses,"Calderon, A. and Griffin, J. and Zagal, J.C.",article,Calderon2014245,RPJOF,"3D printers;  Ability testing;  Computer aided design;  Computer hardware;  Cost reduction;  Developing countries;  Hardware;  Innovation;  Manufacture;  Open source software;  Printing;  Rapid prototyping, Design/methodology/approach;  Digital manufacturing;  High resolution;  Means of productions;  Personal fabrication;  Printing quality;  Revolutionary technology;  Social implication, Printing presses",CAD;  Innovation;  Manufacturing systems;  Rapid prototypes,245-255,,,

Proc.,English,,,American Society for Engineering Education,,"The rapid advancement of low cost embedded systems invites engineering educators to deliver content and skills while engaging students in hands-on projects that may potentially make use of a variety of platforms. From proprietary to open source hardware and software, from microcontrollers to embedded operating systems (OS) devices, students today are challenged to accelerate their learning pace by working on real-world projects in a supervised environment. Currently, students rely on self-guidance in order to develop the knowledge base necessary for achieving the goals of their team projects with respect to embedded systems. This paper presents the results of an embedded systems programming tutorial piloted with a group of 15 undergraduate students from across the engineering disciplines and with a mix of sophomores through seniors. The tutorial included a series of three lecture modules prepared to introduce concepts on embedded systems. The modules were tightly coupled with hands-on exercises that employed the DE2i-150 development board, aimed to introduce students to the development of digital systems based on an Altera field programmable gate array (FPGA) in conjunction with an Linux-based embedded OS running on an Intel Atom processor. The first module provides an overview of the various inputs, outputs, sensors, and displays of the board. The second module introduces the embedded OS and guides students in establishing a high-speed Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) link between the Atom processor and the FPGA. The third module focuses on implementing a custom C/++ application written by students for real- Time processing of inputs from four push buttons. Results show that the three lecture modules of 30 minutes each, coupled with the hands-on projects, offer a good introduction to the complexity of the DE2i-150 board. Surveys collected before the first module and after the third show a generally positive outcome. Recommendations for future efforts focus on incorporating more complex C/++ applications concurrent with FPGA development. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2014.","Georgia Institute of Technology, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84905197651&partnerID=40&md5=f6b6fc8357b24027478fe5a328d12d2f,cited By 0,,,,,2014,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",Evaluation of an introductory embedded systems programming tutorial using hands-on learning methods,"Drayer, G. and Howard, A.",conference,Drayer2014,,"Computer operating systems;  Computer programming;  Embedded systems;  Engineering education;  Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA);  Knowledge based systems;  Open source software;  Open systems, Embedded operating systems;  Engaging students;  Engineering disciplines;  Engineering educators;  Open-source hardwares;  Peripheral component interconnect express;  Real world projects;  Undergraduate students, Students",,,,,

If the Internet of Things is expected to interconnect every day devices or appliances and enable communications between them, a broad range of new services, applications and products can be foreseen. For example, monitoring is a process where sensors have widespread use for measuring environmental parameters (temperature, light, chemical agents, etc.) but obtaining readings at the exact physical point they want to be obtained from, or about the exact wanted parameter can be a clumsy, time-consuming task that is not easily adaptable to new requirements. In order to tackle this challenge, a proposal on a system used to monitor any conceivable environment, which additionally is able to monitor the status of its own components and heal some of the most usual issues of a Wireless Sensor Network, is presented here in detail, covering all the layers that give it shape in terms of devices, communications or services.","CITSEM - Ctro. de Investigacion en Tecnologias Software y Sistemas Multimedia Para la Sostenibilidad, Technical University of Madrid, La Arboleda Campus sur UPM.

Ethernet-based networks, such as EtherCAT, allow every part of an automation system, from sensors to robots, to exchange information at high speeds. This gives the controller instant access to every detail of production information. Once this controller is also connected to the enterprise-level Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP) or Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES). End-user IT departments will have to work more closely with engineering to allow shop-floor equipment to have direct access to enterprise-level systems without the use of middleware. The latest controllers, such as Omron's Sysmac NJ series, combine the reliability and rugged design of a traditional PLC, but use an open hardware architecture combined with software ?engines' within a single CPU, rather than multiple CPUs, to manage their different functions. Ricoh plans to use similar instant communication with an enterprise-level database to scan codes on used toner cartridges sent to its Telford site for recycling. In this case, an NJ controller will allow data, including the number of previous refills, to be checked. This will in turn enable the system to determine whether any given cartridge should be refilled again, while also updating the database.

Therefore, it is a necessity to monitor the environment and be able to trigger alarms when operating outside the recommended settings. There are currently many tools and systems developed for data centre monitoring, but until recent years all of them were of commercial nature and expensive. In recent years there has been an increasing interest in the use of technologies based on Arduino due to its open hardware licensing and the low cost of this type of components. In this article we describe the system developed to monitor IGFAE's data centre, which integrates an Arduino controlled sensor network with the Nagios monitoring software. Sensors of several types, temperature, humidity and pressure, are connected to the Arduino board. The Nagios software is in charge of monitoring the various sensors and, with the help of Nagiosgraph, to keep track of the historic data and to produce the plots. An Arduino program, developed in house, provides the Nagios plugin with the readout of one or several sensors depending on the plugin's request. The Nagios plugin for reading the temperature sensors also broadcasts an SNMP trap when the temperature gets out of the allowed operating range. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Instituto Galego de Fisica de Altas Enerxías (IGFAE), Universidad de Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84903641035&doi=10.1088%2f1742-6596%2f513%2f6%2f062015&partnerID=40&md5=142cdefaee4a97a37dabbc2b76a07342,cited By 1,062015,10.1088/1742-6596/513/6/062015,TRACK 6,513,2014,Journal of Physics: Conference Series,Arduino and Nagios integration for monitoring,"Fernández, V. and Pazos, A. and Saborido, J. and Seco, M.",conference,Fernández2014,,"Cluster computing;  High energy physics;  Sensor networks, Computing clusters;  Data centres;  Historic data;  Keep track of;  Open hardware;  Operating ranges;  Optimal conditions;  SNMP traps;  Small data, Monitoring",,,,,

Several commercial and open-source solutions are available, based on dedicated hardware and/or open-source software. These solutions aim to achieve a tradeoff between performance and instrumentation cost. In general, high performance and precise monitoring tools are based on dedicated hardware, which is expensive. In contrast, cheaper software-based solutions working on top of a Commercially available Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware are performance-limited, especially when serving high-capacity links. In this context, the paper presents an open-source solution for QoS monitoring of VoIP traffic that achieves high performance at significantly lower costs.

Then, was developed a device that supports transducers for environmental gases, such as: carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), volatile organic compounds (VOC), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2); as well as the possibility to interface with other systems for common gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxygen (O2) before developed. Other environmental measures such as speed and wind direction, temperature and relative humidity, may also be included. In this case, a configurable platform based on mixed-signal circuits, PSoC5, was used for the development of embedded system. This platform can be interfaced with different Arduino shields and achieves the integration of several analog functions. This system manages, acquires and processes signals from the above transducers. The measurements can be displayed on an LCD display, save into an SD memory and send to the Web using Ethernet interface. The device is hand size, easy to carry and can operate with a battery. Its user interface is simple and provides updated and in-situ readings. Currently, successful results have been obtained from the functional and metrology testing of the manufactured prototype. © 2014 IEEE.","Automatic and Electronic Department, Universidad Autónoma de Occidente, Cali, Colombia",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84921633737&doi=10.1109%2fIBERSENSOR.2014.6995517&partnerID=40&md5=d26cb186c90d7d859b2dc530265a71cd,cited By 0,6995517,10.1109/IBERSENSOR.2014.6995517,,,2014,"2014 IEEE 9th IberoAmerican Congress on Sensors, IBERSENSOR 2014 - Conference Proceedings",An electronic and transportable nose for environmental gases monitoring based on mixed-signal SoC and open hardware,"Cabrera-López, J.J. and Latorre Victoria, M.E. and Mejia Jaramillo, P.A.",conference,Cabrera-López2014,,"Carbon;  Carbon dioxide;  Carbon monoxide;  Chemical sensors;  Computer hardware;  Electric signal systems;  Electronic nose;  Environmental design;  Environmental engineering;  Ethernet;  Gas detectors;  Gases;  Hardware;  Integrated circuits;  Liquid crystal displays;  Mixed signal integrated circuits;  Nitrogen;  Nitrogen oxides;  Product design;  Reconfigurable hardware;  Sulfur dioxide;  Transducers;  User interfaces;  Volatile organic compounds, Arduino;  Environment monitoring;  Mixed signal;  PSoC;  transportable, System-on-chip",Arduino;  Environment monitoring;  gas sensor;  mixed-signal;  PSoC;  transportable,,9781479968350,Garcia L.,

941,Scopus,Conference Paper,ACM SIGDA Int Symp Field Program Gate Arrays,English,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,"Multi-ported RAMs are essential for high-performance parallel computation systems. VLIW and vector processors, CGRAs, DSPs, CMPs and other processing systems often rely upon multi-ported memories for parallel access, hence higher performance. Although memories with a large number of read and write ports are important, their high implementation cost means they are used sparingly in designs. As a result, FPGA vendors only provide dual-ported block RAMs to handle the majority of usage patterns. In this paper, a novel and modular approach is proposed to construct multi-ported memories out of basic dual-ported RAM blocks. Like other multi-ported RAM designs, each write port uses a different RAM bank and each read port uses bank replication. The main contribution of this work is an optimization that merges the previous live-value-table (LVT) and XOR approaches into a common design that uses a generalized, simpler structure we call an invalidation-based live-value-table (ILVT). Like a regular LVT, the I-LVT determines the correct bank to read from, but it differs in how updates to the table are made; the LVT approach requires multiple write ports, often leading to an areaintensive register-based implementation, while the XOR approach uses wider memories to accommodate the XOR-ed data and suffers from lower clock speeds. Two specific I-LVT implementations are proposed and evaluated, binary and one-hot coding. The I-LVT approach is especially suitable for larger multi-ported RAMs because the table is implemented only in SRAM cells. The I-LVT method gives higher performance while occupying less block RAMs than earlier approaches: for several configurations, the suggested method reduces the block RAM usage by over 44% and improves clock speed by over 76%. To assist others, we are releasing our fully parameterized Verilog implementation as an open source hardware library. The library has been extensively tested using ModelSim and Altera's Quartus tools.","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, B.C., V6T 1Z4, Canada",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84898931800&doi=10.1145%2f2554688.2554773&partnerID=40&md5=6c231882745dc183298f3863598ac641,cited By 11,,10.1145/2554688.2554773,,,2014,ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field Programmable Gate Arrays - FPGA,Modular multi-ported SRAM-based memories,"Abdelhadi, A.M.S. and Lemieux, G.G.F.",conference,Abdelhadi201435,,"Buffer storage;  Cache memory;  Clocks;  Computer hardware description languages;  Design;  Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA);  Memory architecture;  Open systems;  Parallel processing systems, Block rams;  Embedded memory;  Parallel memory;  Register-file;  Shared memory, Static random access storage",Block RAM;  Cache memory;  Embedded memory;  Multi-ported memory;  Parallel memory access;  Register-file;  Shared memory,35-44,9781450326711,,

Most of the HILs built around the world focus on specific part of a vehicle. This paper describes an in house HIL system developed for the complete hybrid car. In this HIL, the focus was to have HIL based on open hardware which is low cost and modular. It is customizable as per complex interdisciplinary vehicle requirements from Original Equipment Manufacturer that reduces dependency on suppliers and allows testing in an integrated vehicle environment. Code for operating HIL is developed in house. This HIL allows engineers to access ECU and plant model simultaneously and generate test report automatically. It consists of a vehicle plant model developed using MathWorks® Tool chain-MATLAB and Simulink. FPGA Plugin consist of software implementation of vehicle sensors in LabVIEW™ software from National Instruments (NI). NI VeriStand™ provides interface between LabVIEW code and plant model. Each release of vendors' software and functional safety checked in HIL, in an integrated and automated manner, before releasing to production line. This reduces bugs in field and eventually saves money and time to market. Because of early algorithm proving in vehicle development lifecycle, time and resources are saved.

Modern gyrotrons require a precise magnetic field for proper operation which is supplied by an electromagnet with multiple windings. The current for the electromagnet is provided by multiple high-current power supplies. The loss of any one of the power supplies during operation can cause significant and expensive damage to the gyrotron. An independent power supply monitoring system can prevent damage should a magnet power supply fail. This paper presents a magnet current monitor system capable of measuring and monitoring five magnet currents simultaneously. It provides limit tests, an interlock output for power supply failures and a status display for the operator. A self-test feature is included and the measurements and status can be examined through an Ethernet connection. The rapid advance of inexpensive microcontroller technology has led to the development of small microcontroller platforms and associated code libraries that have dramatically decreased the costs and development time required for such projects.

Low recycling rates are often observed in conventional centralized recycling plants due to the challenge of collection and transportation for high-volume low-weight polymers. The recycling rates decline further when low population density, rural and relatively isolated communities are investigated because of the distance to recycling centers makes recycling difficult and both economically and energetically inefficient. The recent development of a class of open source hardware tools (e.g. RecycleBots) able to convert post-consumer plastic waste to polymer filament for 3-D printing offer a means to increase recycling rates by enabling distributed recycling. In addition, to reducing the amount of plastic disposed of in landfills, distributed recycling may also provide low-income families a means to supplement their income with domestic production of small plastic goods. This study investigates the environmental impacts of polymer recycling. A life-cycle analysis (LCA) for centralized plastic recycling is compared to the implementation of distributed recycling in rural areas. Environmental impact of both recycling scenarios is quantified in terms of energy use per unit mass of recycled plastic. A sensitivity analysis is used to determine the environmental impacts of both systems as a function of distance to recycling centers. The results of this LCA study indicate that distributed recycling of HDPE for rural regions is energetically favorable to either using virgin resin or conventional recycling processes. This study indicates that the technical progress in solar photovoltaic devices, open-source 3-D printing and polymer filament extrusion have made distributed polymer recycling and upcycling technically viable. © 2013 Materials Research Society.","Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, United States; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, United States; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84884350793&doi=10.1557%2fopl.2013.258&partnerID=40&md5=d83679cb2422374ae27f30f5057dbcc1,cited By 29,,10.1557/opl.2013.258,,1492,2013,Materials Research Society Symposium Proceedings,Distributed recycling of post-consumer plastic waste in rural areas,"Kreiger, M. and Anzalone, G.C. and Mulder, M.L. and Glover, A. and Pearce, J.M.",conference,Kreiger201391,MRSPD,"Domestic production;  Environmental benefits;  Geographic location;  Isolated community;  Life cycle analysis;  Open-source hardwares;  Population densities;  Solar photovoltaics, Environmental impact;  Life cycle;  Open systems;  Plastic filaments;  Polymers;  Population statistics;  Printing;  Rural areas, Recycling",,91-96,9781605114699,,

However, the aggregate environmental benefits of distributed manufacturing are not clear due to scale reductions and the potential for increases in embodied energy. To quantify the environmental impact of distributed manufacturing using 3D printers, a life cycle analysis was performed on three plastic products. The embodied energy and emissions from conventional large-scale production in low-labor cost countries and shipping are compared to experimental measurements on a RepRap with and without solar photovoltaic (PV) power fabricating products with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA). The results indicate that the cumulative energy demand of manufacturing polymer products can be reduced by 41-64% (55-74% with PV) and concomitant emission reductions using distributed manufacturing with existing low-cost open-source 3D printers when using <25% fill PLA. Less pronounced positive environmental results are observed with ABS, which demands higher temperatures for the print bed and extruder.

It is felt that this issue will be under control if somebody could properly monitor/track the individual trains. But this is not possible by individuals manually and so tracking of trains using a special device integrated in the train seems to be a possibility. This integrated device would then warn the train driver to drive safely and also enable periodically updating its location status in a remote controller. In this paper we propose such a real time train tracking system using the global positioning system (GPS) and communication of information through Ethernet Concepts. The system proposed enables communicating the real time information about the train position and also its health conditions based on few sensors attached/integrated. The proposed system would also provide with the complete information about the different trains running, in the video terminal of the controller, using the available internet facilities and the Google mapping Concepts. This proposed system uses a Arduino - A Electronic open Source hardware which provides the complete computation capability for this work. It is felt that this proposed system would provide a solution for a big organization like Indian railways to enable monitoring all their train movements in one place by using internet or through various LAN networks.

Under circumstances that a particular commercial subsystem with the exact required specific features is unavailable, the realization of such a prototype can be delayed. In this paper, an example of rapid prototyping for a dual-channel biosignal data acquisition system based on the open-source concept is described. The selected biosignal is the finger photoplethysmogram. Except for Matlab, all other software components are open-source. The hardware design of the optical sensor utilized to record the signals is also open-source, making the system extremely affordable with the advantage of flexibility and customization. Precise timing of the samples allows for proper alignment and delay estimation between the acquired traces, useful in arterial stiffness studies. Although the results presented concern only two channels, the system has the ability to be expanded to six channels. Further possible expansions include the addition of custom filtering, on-board data compression and advanced GUI. © 2013 IEEE.","Department of Electronics, Electrical and Systems Engineering, National University Malaysia (UKM), Malaysia; School of Electrical Engineering, SHARIF University of Technology, Tehran, Iran",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84894149944&doi=10.1109%2fICSIMA.2013.6717933&partnerID=40&md5=d2656a7ce008817c391e4924ac38a49a,cited By 1,6717933,10.1109/ICSIMA.2013.6717933,,,2013,"2013 IEEE International Conference on Smart Instrumentation, Measurement and Applications, ICSIMA 2013",Quick deployment of open-source hardware and software for a dual-channel biosignal recorder,"Zahedi, E.",conference,Zahedi2013,,,Electronic rapid prototyping;  medical vital signs;  optical sensors,,9781479908431,,

Rapid advances in electronic technologies have made a variety of inexpensive sensing, monitoring, and control capabilities available. A monitoring system was developed and evaluated for automatic measurement of liquid levels, and demonstrated by monitoring water levels in evaporation pans used in evaporation studies and irrigation scheduling. The system is composed of an ultrasonic sensor, a microcontroller-based data logger, and a temperature sensor. The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance from the sensor to the liquid surface. Air temperature is measured by the temperature sensor, and is used to compensate for changes in the speed of sound due to air-temperature variations to improve accuracy of ultrasonic distance measurements. The datalogger is programmed to take measurements and to store data on a memory card which can be downloaded for processing and analysis. All components of the system were assembled in a PVC housing. The system was tested in the field, and resulted in water levels measured by the system corresponding very closely to those measured manually (R2 &gt; 0.98).

Often, the price of these robots prohibits using more than a handful. A lot of the commercial robots do not possess all the necessary features to perform specific HRI experiments and due to the closed nature of the platform, large modifications are nearly impossible. While open source social robots do exist, they often use high-end components and expensive manufacturing techniques, making them unsuitable for easy reproduction. To address this problem, a new social robotics platform, named Ono, was developed. The design is based on the DIY mindset of the maker movement, using off-the-shelf components and more accessible rapid prototyping and manufacturing techniques. The modular structure of the robot makes it easy to adapt to the needs of the experiment and by embracing the open source mentality, the robot can be easily reproduced or further developed by a community of users. The low cost, open nature and DIY friendliness of the robot make it an ideal candidate for HRI studies that require a large user group. © Springer International Publishing 2013.","Ghent University, Dept. of Industrial Systems and Product Design, Campus Kortrijk, Belgium; Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Brussels, Belgium",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84892421742&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-02675-6_31&partnerID=40&md5=eff0f2f930cdb34451cf8576d3c76247,cited By 9,,10.1007/978-3-319-02675-6_31,,8239 LNAI,2013,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),Systems overview of Ono: A DIY reproducible open source social robot,"Vandevelde, C. and Saldien, J. and Ciocci, M.-C. and Vanderborght, B.",article,Vandevelde2013311,,"Do-It-Yourself;  Emotions;  Facial Expressions;  Maker movement;  Open hardware;  Open sources;  Social robots, Experiments;  Human robot interaction;  Man machine systems;  Manufacture;  Rapid prototyping;  Robotics;  User interfaces, Open systems",Do-It-Yourself;  Emotions;  Facial expressions;  Human-robot interaction;  Maker movement;  Open hardware;  Open source;  Rapid prototyping;  Robotic user interface;  Social robot,311-320,9783319026749,,

Educ.,English,,,,"Information Sciences and Technologies Department, Golisano College of Computing and Information Sciences, Rochester Institute of Technology, 102 Lomb Memorial Drive, Rochester, NY 14623-5603, United States","The teaching of programming skills to young students is often described by those educators involved as problematic at best. Student issues like mathematical maturity, readiness for complex thought, basic problem solving skills, short attention span especially related to the boredom of traditional programming teaching methodologies, and the lack of exciting problems and their solutions with respect to programming assignments contribute to the angst of many a programming instructor. A small fraction of students who ""were just made for programming"" always seem to succeed at whatever programming problem is given to them. However, a majority of students, especially precollege and college freshmen tend to have difficulty in overcoming these issues. It is with that observation that something new, in terms of programming pedagogy, needed to be investigated by this paper's authors. An ideal opportunity requiring successful programming instruction for 7-12 graders in the local metropolitan area presented itself in the winter of 2012. The students were involved in a statewide competition where groups of students self-selected into project options offered by various sponsoring institutions. Under the ""Technology"" choice heading of the state program, the student team and the instructor agreed to program a microprocessor to send messages in International Morse Code. The object of the exercise was to learn basic programming skills and to apply them to solving a problem. The hook was to do something brand new the students had never engaged in, keeping their attention on the end goal, and to see the immediate real-time results of some programming effort along the development cycle as the completed final program took form. The effort was a resounding success; the students learned in a few Saturday morning sessions more about programming than the authors have experienced over weeks of effort in traditional programming classes at the college freshman level. © 2013 ACM.","Information Sciences and Technologies Department, Golisano College of Computing and Information Sciences, Rochester Institute of Technology, 102 Lomb Memorial Drive, Rochester, NY 14623-5603, United States; Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Technology Department, College of Applied Science and Technology, Rochester Institute of Technology, 78 Lomb Memorial Drive, Rochester, NY 14623-5604, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84887301817&doi=10.1145%2f2512276.2512289&partnerID=40&md5=1bd415f20a305ad509e9444f0512eda6,cited By 6,,10.1145/2512276.2512289,,,2013,SIGITE 2013 - Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGITE Annual Conference on Information Technology Education,Using a low-cost open source hardware development platform in teaching young students programming skills,"Hill, L. and Ciccarelli, S.",conference,Hill201363,,"arduino;  C programming;  ide;  IT education;  Morse codes;  Open sources, Information technology;  Mathematical programming;  Problem solving;  Signaling, Students",arduino;  c programming;  ide;  international morse code;  it education;  open source;  young students,63-68,9781450322393,,

Here, we propose detectability of scale-freeness as a benchmark to evaluate time-series extraction settings. Scale-freeness, i.e., power-law distribution of node connections, is a fundamental topological property that is highly conserved across biological networks, and as such needs to be manifest within plausible reconstructions of brain connectivity.

Test Workshop,English,,,,"Department of Computer Engineering, Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn, Estonia",Statistical simulation based design error debug approaches strongly rely on quality of the diagnostic test. At the same time there exists no dedicated technique to perform its quality assessment and engineers are forced to rely on subjective figures such as verification test quality metrics or just the size of the diagnostic test. This paper has proposed two new approaches for assessing diagnostic capability of diagnostic tests for automated bug localization. The first approach relies on probabilistic simulation of diagnostic experiments. The second assessment method is based on calculating Hamming distances of the individual sub-tests in the diagnostic test set. The methods are computationally cheap and they provide for a measure of confidence in the localization results and allow estimating impact of the diagnostic test enhancement. The approach is implemented as a part of an open-source hardware design and debugging framework zamiaCAD.

Atacama uses specialized modules for time-triggered communication of real-time data, which seamlessly integrate with a standard infrastructure using regular best-effort traffic. Atacama enables low and highly predictable communication latency on multi-segmented 1Gbps networks, easy optimization of devices for specific application scenarios, and rapid prototyping of new protocol characteristics.

As we gain more insight into the genomic basis of pathogen infectivity and drug resistance, point-of-care nucleic acid testing will likely become an important tool for global health. In this paper, we present an inexpensive, handheld, battery-powered instrument designed to enable pathogen genotyping in the developing world. Our Microfluidic Biomolecular Amplification Reader (μBAR) represents the convergence of molecular biology, microfluidics, optics, and electronics technology. The μBAR is capable of carrying out isothermal nucleic acid amplification assays with real-time fluorescence readout at a fraction of the cost of conventional benchtop thermocyclers. Additionally, the μBAR features cell phone data connectivity and GPS sample geotagging which can enable epidemiological surveying and remote healthcare delivery. The μBAR controls assay temperature through an integrated resistive heater and monitors real-time fluorescence signals from 60 individual reaction chambers using LEDs and phototransistors. Assays are carried out on PDMS disposable microfluidic cartridges which require no external power for sample loading. We characterize the fluorescence detection limits, heater uniformity, and battery life of the instrument. As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrate the detection of the HIV-1 integrase gene with the μBAR using the Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) assay. Although we focus on the detection of purified DNA here, LAMP has previously been demonstrated with a range of clinical samples, and our eventual goal is to develop a microfluidic device which includes on-chip sample preparation from raw samples.

Since the cost of USRP is high, a low cost set up is needed which is affordable by the student community. In this paper a low cost alternative to USRP is proposed using RTL-SDR (Realtek Software Defined Radio) which is only used for reception. For transmitting purpose, a mixer circuit can be used to map the baseband signal to the band that can be received by RTL-SDR on the other end on Linux / Windows platform.

Collaborations and interactions are the backbone of the contemporary Do-It-Yourself (DIY) or 'maker culture', a distributed milieu of open software programmers and hardware hackers, but also crafters, backyard tinkerers, hobbyists and homesteaders. The scene is held together by micro-management tactics, or 'molecular' management, using protocols to guide collaborative innovation and shared craft practices, forming an emergent and innovative creative cottage industry. The maker culture is thus less of a DIY and more a do-it-together culture, merging collaborative play and interactions, often for the sake of shared curiosity. The mindset of the participants is that of the explorative craftsman; using a practical attitude of sharing ideas, methods and skills among practitioners, and the interactions are managed in a flat and meshworked manner through the use of protocols. The text specifically examines the protocols of the maker movement, finding an immediate connection between hardware protocols, like the 'makers bill of rights' guiding the principles of open source hardware, and the principles reflected in the social protocols of two hacker spaces. The maker culture is not only a loose network of dispersed tinkerers, it is also a close-knit molecular assemblage of materials, tools, skills and makers. © 2012 Intellect Ltd Editorial.

J.,English,,19328184,,"Library and Information Center, Faculty of Sciences and Engineering, Heraklion Crete 71409, Greece","Print management solutions are necessary for organizations that need to monitor, report and charge printing or photocopying usage, especially in large domains where business goals require streamlined procedures. High-end print management systems offer integrated credit reception and efficient, parametrized accounting for the use of resources. The usage of printers and photocopy machines is controlled and monitored, and, through the latter, waste elimination is achieved. Print management inherently conforms with the rationale and mentality of green and eco-friendly technologies that also relate with the ethos of the open source movement in IT. One would expect that open source print management solutions would thrive; however, the vast majority of integrated management systems are commercial. There is only a small number of valuable open source print accounting solutions, but there are none that integrate accounting with a form of credit reception. This paper presents the design of an open system that integrates the provision of automated credit reception with accounting services in order to produce an open solution that fully automates the business process of print charging. The objective is to design the necessary automations for credit reception so that it can be realized without any human intervention, to plan the integration with a suitable open print accounting system and to specify any complementary utilities and tools necessary for production installations. © 2007-2012 IEEE.","Library and Information Center, Faculty of Sciences and Engineering, Heraklion Crete 71409, Greece; Department of Science, Technological Educational Institute of Crete, Greece",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84885175115&doi=10.1109%2fJSYST.2012.2223514&partnerID=40&md5=2defa7fda78acf3f0441d37e7b37059b,cited By 1,6488715,10.1109/JSYST.2012.2223514,4,7,2013,IEEE Systems Journal,The concept and design of an open integrated print charging system,"Kalochristianakis, M. and Grammatikakis, K. and Saldaris, M. and Demesoukas, I. and Tzanodaskalakis, G.",article,Kalochristianakis2013692,,"Eco-friendly technologies;  Human intervention;  Integrated management systems;  Open source movement;  Open Source Software;  Open-source hardwares;  Photocopy machine;  Waste eliminations, Design;  Distributed computer systems;  Photocopying;  Printing;  Printing machinery;  Software engineering;  Ubiquitous computing, Open systems",Distributed computing;  open source hardware;  open source software;  printing machinery;  ubiquitous computing,692-699,,,

Software community projects like Player, Stage, Gazebo, ROS, or OpenCV are present in most robotic applications. In recent years this trend has also been initiated among electronic and mechanical developments (open hardware). The Arduino development platform is a good example of a successful hardware project with a great community of developers and users around it. The apparition of personal 3D printers is bringing the open source philosophy to the fabrication of physical things as well. This new technology is in need of new designing tools to take advantage of it. In this paper we are presenting the C++ Object Oriented Mechanics Library (OOML), a tool to design mechanical components, taking into account the needs and requirements of these emerging technologies. These designs can be easily shared, reused, and modified. The OOML brings together the advantages of (1) modelling things through code, (2) the object oriented programming paradigm, and (3) the power of C++. In the OOML, mechanical parts are described as geometrical combinations of basic primitives. Once a part is defined, fabrication files can be generated in order to print, or mechanize it.

To assist in this aim, this paper introduces a library of open-source 3-D-printable optics components. This library operates as a flexible, low-cost public-domain tool set for developing both research and teaching optics hardware. First, the use of parametric open-source designs using an open-source computer aided design package is described to customize the optics hardware for any application. Second, details are provided on the use of open-source 3-D printers (additive layer manufacturing) to fabricate the primary mechanical components, which are then combined to construct complex optics-related devices. Third, the use of the open-source electronics prototyping platform are illustrated as control for optical experimental apparatuses. This study demonstrates an open-source optical library, which significantly reduces the costs associated with much optical equipment, while also enabling relatively easily adapted customizable designs. The cost reductions in general are over 97%, with some components representing only 1% of the current commercial investment for optical products of similar function. The results of this study make its clear that this method of scientific hardware development enables a much broader audience to participate in optical experimentation both as research and teaching platforms than previous proprietary methods. © 2013 Zhang et al.","Michigan Tech Open Sustainability Technology Laboratory, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, United States; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, United States; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84875448705&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0059840&partnerID=40&md5=2f7878f62e025d13defc7d1dd6287ad8,cited By 112,e59840,10.1371/journal.pone.0059840,3,8,2013,PLoS ONE,Open-Source 3D-Printable Optics Equipment,"Zhang, C. and Anzalone, N.C. and Faria, R.P. and Pearce, J.M.",article,Zhang2013,,"article;  computer aided design;  computer program;  cost minimization analysis;  equipment design;  optics;  process development;  process optimization;  three dimensional imaging, Computer-Aided Design;  Costs and Cost Analysis;  Magnetics;  Optics and Photonics;  Printing;  Thermodynamics",,,,,

Security in GSM, albeit being one of the most important issues, has not yet been scrutinized to a level it deserves owing mainly to the expensive hardware requirements and lack of thorough understanding of GSM protocols in general. This scenario is changing significantly with the growing rate of development of open-source tools, which can serve to harness the RF signaling and enable processing on a general purpose workstation.

A light is connected in parallel with the motor to help communicate the force's strength visually. The FireFader consists of only open-source hardware and open-source software elements. Consequently, it is relatively easy for users to repurpose it into new projects involving varying kinds and numbers of motors and sensors. An open-source device driver for the FireFader allows it to be linked to a computer via USB so that the computer can perform the feedback control calculations. For example, the computer can simulate the acoustics of a virtual musical instrument to concurrently synthesize sound and calculate the motor force as a function of the fader position. The serial connection over USB increases the latency of the control signal compared to embedded implementations, but the serial connection facilitates easier programming via the computer, and the force feedback can be automatically disabled when the user is not touching the fader.

The pilot project for this initiative is the Multi-Purpose Avionics Core Element (M-PACE). The primary goal of M-PACE is to demonstrate advanced manufacturing techniques, such as additive manufacturing and Digital Materials, to minimize the cost of cube satellites and increase their modularity. M-PACE will be designed and built at the NASA Ames' SpaceShop, which is a state-of-the-art advanced manufacturing facility built for NASA researchers to formulate ideas for projects. The final products of M-PACE are several completed side panels of a one-unit (1U) (10 cm cube) cube satellite prototype built using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components, which will show the basic functionality of the internal payload by connecting it to the side panels for power and other subsystem capabilities. Within the structure, we are investigating the use of Digital Materials, which are universal building materials with the ability to increase precision and ease of assembly and disassembly of three dimensional (3D) objects. M-PACE will use COTS power systems and open-source hardware and software to distribute data through Ethernet through the use of snap-fit card connectors. Similar to Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) Express cards, we envision the spacecraft subsystems and payloads to be on a PC104-like board that will slide into the side panel connectors to enable distribution of power and data.

These self-replicating rapid prototypers (RepRaps) can manufacture approximately half of their own parts from sequential fused deposition of polymer feedstocks. RepRaps have been demonstrated for conventional prototyping and engineering, customizing scientific equipment, and appropriate technology-related manufacturing for sustainable development. However, in order for this technology to proliferate like 2-D electronic printers have, it must be economically viable for a typical household. This study reports on the life-cycle economic analysis (LCEA) of RepRap technology for an average US household. A new low-cost RepRap is described and the costs of materials and time to construct it are quantified. The economic costs of a selection of 20 open-source printable designs (representing less than 0.02% of those available), are typical of products that a household might purchase, are quantified for print time, energy, and filament consumption and compared to low and high Internet market prices for similar products without shipping costs. The results show that even making the extremely conservative assumption that the household would only use the printer to make the selected 20 products a year the avoided purchase cost savings would range from about $300 to $2000/year. Assuming the 25 h of necessary printing for the selected products is evenly distributed throughout the year these savings provide a simple payback time for the RepRap in 4 months to 2 years and provide an ROI between >200% and >40%. As both upgrades and the components that are most likely to wear out in the RepRap can be printed and thus the lifetime of the distributing manufacturing can be substantially increased the unavoidable conclusion from this study is that the RepRap is an economically attractive investment for the average US household already. It appears clear that as RepRaps improve in reliability, continue to decline in cost and both the number and assumed utility of open-source designs continues growing exponentially, open-source 3-D printers will become a mass-market mechatronic device. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

1028,Scopus,Conference Paper,"Proc. Int. Astronaut. Congr., IAC",English,,00741795,"International Astronautical Federation, IAF",,"Small satellite missions face two special challenges due to limited financial budgets. The first is tracking the satellite for orbit determination after orbit injection. The orbit can vary from the specified orbit when the satellite will be launched as secondary or parasitic payload. In case of unknown orbit parameters high-gain antennas can't be pointed towards the satellite and establish the first connection needed for satellite activation. The second challenge is to transmit all housekeeping and scientific data to mission operations via a limited number of ground-stations. The Distributed Ground Station Network (DGSN) solution can solve the problem with permanent tracking and a faster orbital element provision to the satellite owners. And it can provide permanent reception of satellite signals with its data-dump mode in between main ground-stations provided by the satellite owner. The key feature is the network of small ground-stations placed globally connected via the internet and performing an automatic scan of satellite (and other beacon) signals, storing and sending them back to a central server, where they can be accessed by the satellite owner. With a correlation of the beacon signal and GNSS synched ground-station time the satellite position is determined with pseudo-ranging trilateration. In contrast to ground-station time sharing concepts of Radio Aurora Explorer (SRI International in California and University of Michigan), AlSat (DLR) and QB50-GENSO (Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics) that rely on a limited number of amateur radio operators and expensive hardware with limited availability DGSN uses an innovative citizen science approach. The participatory aspect includes the deployment of ground-station hardware and acquisition of satellite signal data but also the open-source hardware. In this way a high number of built sensornodes can be achieved and it also creates a new market for selling ready ground-stations. The network owners an open-platform for every small satellite operator with a faster access to tracking data than the update period by NORAD or ESTRACK with less running costs. The low data-rate reception is compensated by the global and permanent coverage. DGSN will offer the orbital parameters of the received satellite signal under a free license. The feasibility study had been conducted as part of Azorean observing VERDE Sat during the Small Satellite Project at the Institute of Space Systems (IRS) of the University of Stuttgart and DGSN is in the prototyping and testing phase of the ground-stations. ©2013 by the International Astronautical Federation.

For example, in the case of classical music orchestras, their conductors perform sound mixing by specifying the repro- duction gain of specific groups of musical instruments or of the entire orchestra. Moreover, modern sound artists and performers also employ sound mixing when they com- pose music or improvise in real-time. In this work a system is presented that incorporates a gestural interface for real- time multitrack sound mixing. The proposed gestural sound mixing control scheme is implemented on an open hardware micro-controller board, using common sensor modules. The gestures employed are as close as possible to the ones partic- ularly used by the orchestra conductors.

Technollaboration, is how creative digital communities use technology to improve methods and environments for collaboration. Postbiotanical, after or more than biotanical, represents the future of human-centric collectives around farming and urban living and sustainability. Village, is ambiguous and raises the question how large is local, and how does a village-centric view impact the way we treat each other? Art traditionally functions as an environment for philosophical and creative activity that works to secure its borders from intruding dictatorial ethics, ideology, politics or dogma that might sully its aim to maintain its open arduous exploration of the clash between image and meaning, icon and significance, or perception and identity in reference to culture and history. Integrating technology into this discourse introduces a milieu of associations, expectations and conclusions about how technological innovation, practices and products should be steered, which can also influence what we both make and teach. The web has since evolved into a pervasively instantaneous space for more involved forms of communication (Google hangout), content sharing (SVN), publishing (blogs), community building (messageboards, Facebook), creative performance (Isadora) and more. Now creative interactive initiatives are not limited to merely making a statement or triggering a semiotic synapse, but rather can have a social impact, enacting, mobilizing and serving as a resource for the public. Telematic Art that includes the activities surrounding Digital Communities and their behaviour, does not merely provide an environment to discuss social issues, but embodies social interaction in ways in which new forms of collective expression can be realized. The development of telematics tools is empowering for the public while serving as a medium that influences how individuals interact. Between DIY/DIWO models, open source hardware, software, and creation initiatives, practivist initiatives, creative hacking ideologies, immersion, and web-based communication tools to localize the international collaborative workshop, I believe our formats for education and exchange are becoming more collective and empowering, and with the inclusion of digital social collaboration initiatives seen in myriad examples of Telematic Art, there exists the potential to motivate a mindset desiring new shifts in perception and making with the goals of serving the global community in significant and direct ways.","Gallaudet University, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84897490960&doi=10.1386%2ftear.11.3.253_1&partnerID=40&md5=a2829cee9f90faea1e663ee1a65fb0d7,cited By 0,,10.1386/tear.11.3.253_1,3,11,2013,Technoetic Arts,Postnational technollaboration within the postbiotanical village (an apophenoetic prophecy),"Kazemzadeh, M.",article,Kazemzadeh2013253,,,Collaboration;  Consciousness;  Cybernetics;  Food deserts;  Lilipad;  Refarmthecity;  Urban farming;  Waterworks,253-261,,,

Eng.,English,,18761100,Springer Verlag,"Hettel, R.; IPEK-Institute of Product Engineering, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Karlsruhe, Germany; email: friedrich.brezger@kit.edu","In FISITA 2010 IPEK (Institute of Product Engineering) introduced the vehicle-in-the-loop platform based on its X-in-the-loop approach (F2010-C-177) (Albers and Düser, Implementation of a vehicle-in-the-loop development and validation platform, FISITA world automotive congress, Budapest, 2010). It offers a methodology for multi domain product development and validation as well focuses on its key hypothesis that validation is the main task in every step of product development process. An open hardware and software platform allows integration of different real components and simulation models as well as the usage of established tools and methods for measurement and validation. The platform is based on a common hardware-in-the-loop System using extended I/O-communication to the vehicle and the test bench. The application is done in C code and Matlab/Simulink so an easy exchange of modular simulation models and test cases is feasible. The architecture of model-, component- and test case implementation simplifies the scalability as well as the modularization. IPEK uses this platform amongst others for its improved fully automated validation environment which allows the optimization of operating time for determination of shifting quality on the chassis dynamometer. The task is to perform several hundred gearshifts under particular reproducible conditions automatically such as engine speed or even battery state of charge, which normally a real driver had to perform on a real test track. Compared to road tests on the rig it is possible to reach time benefits of over 80% by using a special driver model for acceleration (using gas pedal), deceleration (using dynamometer) and gear shifting (using tip signal at steering wheel). Since the vehicle behaviour on the road is constrained to different environmental conditions it is necessary to reproduce these conditions on the test bench accurately. Different resistances affect the vehicles responses such as shifting strategy, acceleration characteristics or fuel consumption which results in altering test results. State of the art for simulating environmental conditions and vehicle characteristics on the chassis dynamometer is the Road-Load-Simulation (RLS) which uses measured vehicle coast downs to map the static resistances of a real car on a real track onto the test bench. These coast downs have to be redone every single time components of the car or the environment changes. In addition, changing resistances during test like air drag due to headwind and rolling drag due to tire temperature or abrasion can't be simulated based on that static coast down. This paper shows an approach for simulating all kind of resistances that can appear and vary during the test such as air drag (wind), road gradient, road friction, curve resistance etc. in real-time. It can be used to drive test cases like the determination of characteristic shifting map in a more realistic way to perform better validated results. Central point is a configurable vehicle and environment model which has to be parameterized with data from the real car and track and then calculates the necessary dynamometer responses. Applied with a four roller dynamometer (two or even four driven axles) it offers the possibility to perform complex all-wheel manoeuvres e.g. such as l-split or cornering with independent wheel behaviour and slip. Besides the advantages of this approach, an analysis of different influencing factors is shown in this paper. © Springer-Verlag 2013.","IPEK-Institute of Product Engineering, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Karlsruhe, Germany; AVL Zöllner GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84903633448&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-642-33738-3_28&partnerID=40&md5=703087df3428d486fcf98974072397fa,cited By 2,,10.1007/978-3-642-33738-3_28,VOL. 8,196 LNEE,2013,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,Extended flexible environment and vehicle simulation for an automated validation,"Albers, A. and Hettel, R. and Behrendt, M. and Dus̈er, T. and Schwarz, A.",article,Albers20131263,,"C (programming language);  Computer simulation;  Digital storage;  Drag;  Dynamometers;  Hardware;  Modular construction;  Product development;  Roads and streets;  Vehicles;  Wheels, Chassis dynamometers;  Environment simulation;  Model based testing;  Road loads;  Vehicle simulation;  Vehicle-in-the-loop;  X-in-the-loop (XiL), Vehicle to vehicle communications",Chassis dynamometer;  Environment simulation;  Model based testing;  Road load simulation;  Vehicle simulation;  Vehicle-in-the-loop;  X-in-the-loop (XiL),1263-1273,9783642337376,,

It was only in the 1960's that the fifth function (after input, memory, processing and output) was introduced: the network, the capability of this single computational node to be connected and exchange data with similar machines. In the last fifty years the network has grown at an incredible speed, introducing us into the post-Turing ICT era: billions of electronic devices interconnected. ICT has now a significant environmental impact along all its lifetime phases: manufacturing (based on scarce minerals), application (based on growing power consumption) and e-waste management (with open cycles difficult to close).

State-of-the-art microcontroller units provide a wide range of ultra-low-power inactive modes with sub-millisecond wakeup time that can be effectively used for this purpose. At the same time they are equipped with 16-bit RISC architectures clocked at tens of MHz, which make them powerful enough to run a Java-compatible virtual machine (VM). This makes it possible to bring the benefits of a virtual runtime environment into power-constrained embedded systems. VMs, however, risk to impair the effectiveness of dynamic power management as they are seen as always-active processes by the scheduler of the operating system in spite of the idleness of the threads running on top of them. Avoiding to keep sensor nodes busy when they could be idle is mandatory for the energetic sustainability of WSNs.

Aracna is an open-source hardware project composed of off-the-shelf and 3D-printed parts, enabling other research teams to modify its design according to their scientific needs. Aracna was designed to overcome the shortcomings of a previous quadruped robot platform, whose legs were so heavy that the motors could not reliably execute the commands sent to them. We avoid this problem by locating all motors in the body core instead of on the legs and through a design which enables the servos to have a greater mechanical advantage. Specifically, each of the four legs has two joints controlled by separate four-bar linkage mechanisms that drive the pitch of the hip joint and knee joint. This novel design causes unconventional kinematics, creating an opportunity for gaitlearning algorithms, which excel in counter-intuitive design spaces where human engineers tend to underperform. Because it is low-cost, flexible, kinematically interesting, and and improvement over a previous design, Aracna provides a useful new hardware platform for testing algorithms that automatically generate robotic behaviors. © 2012 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.","Cornell University, 239 Upson Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84874740310&partnerID=40&md5=1a482f2f056fecb2d4ba59c4e5d77311,cited By 10,,,,,2012,"Artificial Life 13: Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on the Simulation and Synthesis of Living Systems, ALIFE 2012",Aracna: An open-source quadruped platform for evolutionary robotics,"Lohmann, S. and Yosinski, J. and Gold, E. and Clune, J. and Blum, J. and Lipson, H.",conference,Lohmann2012387,,"Artificial Life;  Design spaces;  Evolutionary robotics;  Excel;  Four-bar linkage;  Four-leg;  Hardware platform;  Hip joints;  Knee joint;  Mechanical advantage;  Motor commands;  Novel design;  Open-source;  Open-source hardwares;  Quadruped Robots;  Research teams;  Robotic behavior;  Testing algorithm, Biological systems;  Hardware;  Joints (anatomy);  Learning algorithms;  Multipurpose robots, Design",,387-392,9780262310505,,

We designed a position-independent differencing algorithm to robustly handle language constructs whose relative orderings do not matter. This paper presents Vdiff, an instantiation of this position-independent differencing algorithm for Verilog HDL. To help programmers reason about the differences at a high-level, Vdiff outputs syntactic differences in terms of Verilog-specific change types. The quantitative evaluation of Vdiff on two open source hardware design projects shows that Vdiff is very accurate, with overall 96.8 % precision and 97.3 % recall when using manually classified differences as a basis of comparison. Vdiff is also fast and scalable-it processes the entire revision history of nine open projects all under 5.35 minutes. We conducted a user study with eight hardware design experts to understand how the program differences identified by the experts match Vdiff's output.

A predictive maintenance program includes condition monitoring of the rotating machinery, to anticipate possible conditions of failure. To increase the operational reliability it is thus necessary an efficient tool to analyze and monitor the equipments, in real-time, and enabling the detection of e.g. incipient faults in bearings. To fulfill these requirements some innovations have become frequent, namely the inclusion of vibration sensors or stator current sensors. These innovations enable the development of new design methodologies that take into account the ease of future modifications, upgrades, and replacement of the monitored machine, as well as expansion of the monitoring system.

They are able to fulfill multiple purposes, ranging from energy saving or location based reminders to burglary detection. Particularly useful are combined systems that include localization, as well as additional services e.g. fall detection. Capacitive sensing systems that allow detecting the presence of a body over distance are a possible solution for indoor localization that has been used in the past. However usually the installation requirements are high and consequently they are expensive to integrate. We propose a flexible, integrated solution based on affordable, open-source hardware that allows indoor localization and fall detection specifically designed for challenges in the context of AAL. The system is composed of sensing mats that can be placed under various types of floor covering that wirelessly transmit data to a central platform providing localization and fall detection services to connected AAL platforms.

These include expansions from software into general culture through 'Free Culture' movements and, more recently, expansions from software into hardware and design. This article provides a critical perspective on the democratic potential of these broader 'open' contribution structures by examining how open source contributions to both software and hardware increase the opportunities for democratic participation in production, governance and knowledge exchange. By analysing attempts to 'open source' the sharing of hardware designs, it also notes the limitations of this democratization. The insights developed in the article nuance the relationship between open source cultures and commercial and market structures, identifying how the generative opportunities created by certain aspects of open source contribution structures increase the potential for democratizing production of communication tools, but also how incongruities across different open-source cultures and communities of practice limit the democratic potential of these processes. © The Author(s) 2012.","LSE, Houghton Street, London WC2A 2AE, United Kingdom",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84865798823&doi=10.1177%2f0163443712449497&partnerID=40&md5=b23ad30786eb4a8310d495724770beeb,cited By 32,,10.1177/0163443712449497,6,34,2012,"Media, Culture and Society",Democratizing production through open source knowledge: From open software to open hardware,"Powell, A.",article,Powell2012691,,,democratic media production;  design;  knowledge exchange;  monopolies of knowledge;  open source cultures;  political economy,691-708,,,

That is the latest buzz arising from the Californian trade press. What do we get when this dictum is sampled with the old rallying cry: ""Information wants to be free""? We suggest that the predominant, bounded critique of intellectual property is thereby destabilised. Constitutive of that critique was the exceptionality attributed to infor-mation goods (bits) vis-a-vis tangible goods (atoms). It was thus intellectual property could be presented as something altogether different from private property. We recognise that this way of framing the issue has had tactical advantages, but contend that it has stood in the way of a deeper understanding of what intellectual property is. When the critique of proprie-tary software is expanded by an emerging movement for open hardware development, however, the boundary between intellectual property and property as such crumbles.

For example, the laptop can simulate the acoustics of a virtual musical instrument to calculate the motor force as a function of the fader position.

This paper is to propose an architecture of intelligent controller via multi-agent-based conceptual as the reference architecture. It can be successfully used to create an open CNC on ISO standard of ISO 14649 and ISO 10303. This offers interoperability, portability, and adaptability. The proposed framework consists of four main modules, STEP-NC interface, simulator, data warehouse, and communication. In order to optimize, the controller should incorporate with various technology related to intelligent, such as kernel software, open communication port and open hardware design. The architecture will be implemented in CNC controller and to be tested later on actual milling machine. It will simplify the design of CNC machine controller with the architecture layers responsible for data processing, data storage, execution and feedback.

Up to 60% of the energy consumed in a data center is used for cooling in wasteful ways as a result of lack of environmental information and overcompensated cooling systems. In this project, a wireless sensor network for data-enter environmental monitoring was developed to improve energy efficiency and to optimize data-center performance. The sensor network consists of a suite of sensor nodes for data sensing, a router node to relay sensed data, and a coordinator node to establish a network, receive the data, and process the data. The prototype sensor network was built on Arduino open source hardware with a seamlessly integrated XBee RF module and configured to operate within the ZigBee mesh network standard. A 24-hour test run at Argonne's data center demonstrated that the wireless networked environmental monitoring solution is easy to integrate and manage with the existing IT infrastructure, while delivering better visibility into the data center's 3D temperature and humidity distribution and substantial improvements in energy efficiency. © 2011 IEEE.","Laboratory for Integrated Sensing Technologies, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Puerto Rico - Mayaguez, Mayaguez, PR 00681-9045, Puerto Rico; Mathematics and Computer Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, 9700 S Cass Avenue, Argonne, IL 60439, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84857727457&doi=10.1109%2fICSensT.2011.6137036&partnerID=40&md5=53cfbddc8db1546a5dad75b008c9317e,cited By 36,6137036,10.1109/ICSensT.2011.6137036,,,2011,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Sensing Technology, ICST",Wireless sensor network for data-center environmental monitoring,"Rodriguez, M.G. and Ortiz Uriarte, L.E. and Jia, Y. and Yoshii, K. and Ross, R. and Beckman, P.H.",conference,Rodriguez2011533,,"Data centers;  Data sensing;  Environmental information;  Environmental Monitoring;  Humidity distribution;  IT infrastructures;  Mesh network;  Open sources;  Prototype sensor;  RF module;  Wireless sensor, Energy efficiency;  Energy utilization;  Environmental engineering;  Information technology;  Open systems;  Routers;  Sensor nodes;  Zigbee, Information management",data center;  energy efficiency management;  environmental monitoring;  wireless sensor network;  ZigBee,533-537,9781457701672,,

Congr., IAC",English,,,,"Boshuizen, C.R.; National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Stinger Ghaffarian Technologies (SGT), Moffett Field, CA, United States; email: Christopher.R.Boshuizen@nasa.gov","A large proportion of the space industry is moribund with long development cycles, high, rising (or at best stagnant) costs, and an extreme aversion to risk. Meanwhile, other industries such as consumer electronics see development cycles between 3-6 months, exponentially lowering costs per unit capability and a more lenient attitude towards risk. Why aren't these trends seen more widely in the space industry? Based on our experience with the NASA ""PhoneSat 1.0"" mission and the joint SSTL and Surrey Space Centre ""STRaND-I"" mission, we explore the possibilities that arise by adopting and exploiting innovations from outside industries. The smartphone technology central to both our efforts is a good example, with the smartphone industry investing billions of dollars to produce robust, tightly packaged devices with very high levels of capability. Using this technology as-is offers many benefits for space applications. These include leveraging widespread open source software, the opportunity for extreme rapid prototyping, and faster, cheaper missions with potentially higher capability. Significantly, this approach dictates a new paradigm with different rules where the large consumer electronics industry leads and the space sector follows. There is room for greater risk tolerance, spacecraft can be disposable (while still being mindful of debris issues). They can be designed, built and be flight ready on very tight timescales (days or weeks), and also launched in great quantities (hundreds, thousands), offering technological and responsive capabilities not feasible today. They integrate more advanced multi-core technologies. The fast iteration time-scales of the hardware coupled with open source software and open hardware platforms also allow for rapid prototyping and testing of spaceflight software. The capability for fast release cycles is something not typically seen in space-flight software. Smartphones in particular offer standardized platforms for software development, as well as very large communities of talented programmers. This allows the focus of innovation to ultimately shift away from the hardware, and further into the software and information technology domains. The open source aspects of our efforts also open up the opportunity for many people to undertake their own space exploration, from school students to hobbyists. While CubeSats and other opportunities have been possible for some time, it is only through this approach that we are capable of easily producing high-capability spacecraft within the means of ordinary people. This means that their efforts are also meaningful, and could provide valuable contributions to science and human well being on Earth. Copyright ©2010 by the International Astronautical Federation.

Because of limited adoption of tools that seamlessly integrate all aspects of a research project (conception, data generation, data evaluation, peerreviewing and publishing of conclusions), much effort is later spent on reproducing or reformatting individual entities before they can be repurposed independently or as parts of articles. We propose that workows-performed both individually and collaboratively-could potentially become more efficient if all steps of the research cycle were coherently represented online and the underlying data were formatted, annotated and licensed for reuse. Such a system would accelerate the process of taking projects from conception to publication stages and allow for continuous updating of the data sets and their interpretation as well as their integration into other independent projects. A major advantage of such workows is the increased transparency, both with respect to the scientific process as to the contribution of each participant. The latter point is important from a perspective of motivation, as it enables the allocation of reputation, which creates incentives for scientists to contribute to projects. Such workow platforms offering possibilities to fine-tune the accessibility of their content could gradually pave the path from the current static mode of research presentation into a more coherent practice of open science.","Institute for Molecular Infection Biology, University of Würzburg, D-97080 Würzburg, Germany; Research Centre for Infectious Diseases, University of Würzburg, D-97080 Würzburg, Germany; Julius Kühn-Institute, Federal Research Center for Cultivated Plants, Berlin, Germany; Cellular Therapy and Transplantation (CTT), Germany; Department of Anatomy with Radiology, University of Auckland, New Zealand; Science 3.0, Netherlands",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84890772622&partnerID=40&md5=c74c1228b3bdf3a37d8bf4482248b0a9,cited By 1,,,,739,2011,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,Collaborative platforms for streamlining workows in Open Science,"Förstner, K.U. and Hagedorn, G. and Koltzenburg, C. and Fabiana Kubke, M. and Mietchen, D.",conference,Förstner2011,,"Collaboratories;  Funding;  Open hardware;  Open science;  Reproducibitliy;  Reputation;  Virtual research environment;  Workow platform, Automation;  Transparency, Research",Automation;  Collaboratories;  Funding;  Open hardware;  Open science;  Reproducibitliy;  Reputation;  Transparency;  Virtual research environments;  Workow platform,,,,6

It allows to monitor transparently, i.e., without any insertion/modification within the code, any deployed application in terms of energy consumption or radio activity. The main benefits of SensLAB for the users are to reduce the costs in terms of: infrastructure investment, maintenance cost and operating cost. With SensLAB you can be up and running minutes after you are assigned an account! SensLAB's main and most important goal is to offer an accurate open access multi-users scientific tool to support the design, development, tuning, and experimentation of real large-scale sensor network applications. During this demo, we propose to demonstrate the interests of the SensLAB testbed by developing and running two experimental scenarii that highlight the services offered by SensLAB. © 2011 IEEE.","ENS de Lyon, France; INRIA, France; INSA de Lyon, France; Université de Strasbourg, France; Université de Lyon, France",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80052434160&doi=10.1109%2fDCOSS.2011.5982186&partnerID=40&md5=608f10868327c74ba54d2449a56e2990,cited By 6,5982186,10.1109/DCOSS.2011.5982186,,,2011,"2011 International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems and Workshops, DCOSS'11",Two demos using SensLAB: Very large scale open WSN testbed,"Des Roziers, C.B. and Chelius, G. and Ducrocq, T. and Fleury, E. and Fraboulet, A. and Gallais, A. and Mitton, N. and Noël, T. and Valentin, E. and Vandaele, J.",conference,DesRoziers2011,,"Configurable;  Infrastructure investment;  Internet application;  Large scale sensor network;  Large-scale wireless sensor networks;  Maintenance cost;  Multiusers;  Open Access;  Open sources;  Radio interface;  Real world setting;  Reproducibilities;  Scientific tool;  Sink nodes;  Wireless nodes, Energy utilization;  Experiments;  Internet protocols;  Investments;  Maintenance;  Open systems;  Sensor nodes;  Sensors;  Telecommunication equipment;  Telecommunication networks;  Testbeds, Test facilities",,,9781457705137,,

By providing hardware-level protection, a secure processor ensures a safe computing environment where confidential data and applications can be protected against both hardware and software attacks. In this paper, we present a single-chip secure processor model and demonstrate rapid prototyping of the secure processor on the OpenSPARC FPGA platform. OpenSPARC T1 is an industry-grade, open-source, FPGA-synthesizable general-purpose microprocessor originally developed by Sun Microsystems, now acquired by Oracle. It is a multi-core, multi-threaded 64-bit processor with open-source hardware, including the microprocessor core, as well as system software that can be freely modified by researchers. We modify the OpenSPARC T1 processor by adding security modules: an AES engine, a TRNG and a memory integrity tree. These enhancements enable security features like memory encryption and memory integrity verification. By prototyping this single-chip secure processor on the FPGA platform, we find that the OpenSPARC T1 FPGA platform has many advantages for secure processor research. Our prototyping demonstrates that additional modules can be added quickly and easily and they add little resource overhead to the base OpenSPARC processor. © 2011 IEEE.","Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Electrical Engineering Department, Princeton University, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79960684743&doi=10.1109%2fRSP.2011.5929973&partnerID=40&md5=18422b160b7a21bcfaa65302fbab9ec0,cited By 8,5929973,10.1109/RSP.2011.5929973,,,2011,Proceedings of the International Workshop on Rapid System Prototyping,Rapid single-chip secure processor prototyping on the Open SPARC FPGA platform,"Szefer, J.M. and Zhang, W. and Chen, Y.-Y. and Champagne, D. and Chan, K. and Li, W.X.Y. and Cheung, R.C.C. and Lee, R.B.",conference,Szefer201138,PWRPE,"Computing environments;  Confidential data;  General-purpose microprocessors;  Hardware and software;  Integrity tree;  Memory encryption;  Memory integrity verification;  Microprocessor core;  Multi core;  Multithreaded;  Open-source;  Secure processors;  Security breaches;  Security features;  Security modules;  Single-chip;  Sun microsystems;  System softwares;  Trustworthy computing, Microprocessor chips;  Rapid prototyping;  Specifications, Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)",,38-44,9781457706585,,

We argue that produsage is not a model that determines a change in the traditional consumption/production paradigm through a series of essential preconditions (such as open participation, peer-sharing, or common ownership). Rather, we explain produsage as the open-ended result of a series of heterogeneous actor-networking strategies. In this view, the so-called preconditions do not explain produsage but have to be explained along with its establishment as an actor-network. Drawing on this approach, we discuss a case study of an open hardware project: the Arduino board, and we develop a perspective that maps the skills of human and non-human entities in produsage actor-networks, showing how skills are symmetrical, relational, and circulating. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Department of Sociology and NIRSA, Iontas Building, National University of Ireland Maynooth, Maynooth, Co.

The student team was composed of seven students within an aeronautical concentration of their Mechanical Engineering Technology program. The students designed and built a UAV capable of flying under direct manual control and indirect automatic control. Direct manual control was accomplished via a model radio-control transmitter, while indirect control accomplished via the onboard autopilot system. Programmable autonomous flight software, utilizing global positioning satellites (GPS), controls the autopilot system. A ground control station (GCS) sends and receives telemetry from a 2.4GHz modem located in the UAV. The GCS utilized Paparazzi, an open-source hardware and software autopilot platform, which allows mission specific flight plans to be created, uploaded, and executed and monitored during the UAV's flight. Real-time video from the UAV is transmitted to the GCS via an antenna and receiver. This comprehensive design and build project, concluding with successful test flights, enhanced the student learning and performance during the course of the project.

Energy storage is a critical technology for electric vehicles and to some extent for intermittent renewable energy sources. Battery life, performance, and cost remain a barrier to widespread use of battery energy storage. Increasing the number of students researching these technologies would increase the likelihood of progress. The process of testing batteries to characterize performance and durability typically requires the use of specialized equipment that may be beyond the budget for many educators. Hence, many interested students may not have access to the tools to perform these experiments. To remedy this, we have begun the development of an open source battery-testing platform that can be built at a fraction of the cost of commercial systems.

However, existing work in wideband audio for telephony has been mainly focused either on mobile telephony or high end teleconferencing equipment but not on ATA devices. This paper proposes improvements to ATA devices that allow an audio bandwidth of 50 Hz to 7 KHz. An implementation is discussed where a minimal upgrade to an open source ATA based on GPL licensed hardware is modified to support wideband, and a middleware layer software is modified to also handle the wider bandwidth. Moreover, promising results when using the modified hardware and software were obtained. The results indicated that with slight CPU overloading, the modified hardware and software can be used for wideband telephony. © 2010 IEEE.","College of Engineering and Computing, Grand Valley State University, Allendale, MI, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78649270075&doi=10.1109%2fEIT.2010.5612176&partnerID=40&md5=d19dbb53b6e15a3ed286bcba084a2751,cited By 2,5612176,10.1109/EIT.2010.5612176,,,2010,"2010 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology, EIT2010",Implementation of wideband VoIP middleware using embedded systems,"Amarandei, D. and El-Said, M.",conference,Amarandei2010,,"Asterisk;  ATA;  Open hardware;  VoIP systems;  Wide-band, Bandwidth;  Embedded systems;  Hardware;  Internet telephony;  Middleware;  Telephone sets;  Telephone systems;  Voice/data communication systems, Audio equipment",Asterisk;  ATA;  GPL licensed open hardware;  VoIP systems;  Wideband telephony,,9781424468751,,

This system decides whether the current block belongs to the object region or not. In this article, a scheme using background modeling based on runtime-weighted features for robustly adaptive moving object segmentation in infrared (IR) image sequence is proposed. Proposed background modeling for an open hardware (HAV) architecture design decreases the size of the search area to construct a sparse block template of search area in infrared images. The authors also compensate for motion compensation when the image moves in previous and current frames of IR imaging system. The method of separation of background and objects applies to adaptive values through time analysis of pixel intensity. The proposed method uses more feature information such as intensity, deviation, block matching error, and velocity. The weighting values give a higher weight to feature information which has a large difference between the object and the background region.

The paper will also describe plans to develop and apply tools, products and solutions to validate the GRA. The paper describes the process associated with engaging industry in developing the GRA Functional Decomposition, validating the GRA through a prototype, creating the GRA as a standard for the Army HC3 Program, and managing to that architecture and standard in a development environment. The paper also describes how GRA validation through use of DSM tools, such as LATTIX, will aid in the development and testing of a GRA Hardware and Software Interface Test Development Environment designed to allow a GRA module developer to develop, interface, and test interface applications to the GRA compatible open hardware/software interfaces. Full documentation shall be developed for all open hardware and software interfaces, sufficient to develop applications with minimum interface or interaction with the module developer. Interface definition stability over time will be a key factor in the mission success of the HC3 open system interfaces, so they must be designed with stability and longevity in mind. This paper will review alternatives for validation of GRA compliant modules. Particular emphasis will be placed on DSM techniques. The interdependencies between modules will be modeled using a DSM so as to provide a big picture view of GRA. DSM can also be used to model and expose key design decisions for the entire team. Rules can be established in the DSM model for GRA compliance to guide a GRA module developer during development and testing for validation. The use of DSM to model various hardware and software modules in the HBHT will create a common artifact that can be shared across various teams with different skills and domains of expertise.

Our goal is to eventually create a thriving developer-community, where developers around the world contribute reusable modules and designs for the benefit of the community as a whole. To this end, we have created a repository of ""User Contributed Designs"" at NetFPGA.org. But creating an ""open-source hardware"" platform is quite different from software oriented open-source projects. Designing hardware is much more time consuming - and more error prone - than designing software, and so demands a process that is more focussed on verifying that a module really works as advertised, else others will be reluctant to use it. We have designed a novel process for contributing new designs. Each contributed design is specified entirely by a set of tests it passes. A developer includes a list of tests that their design will pass, along with an executable set of tests that the user can check against. Through this process, we hope to establish the right expectations for someone who reuses a design, and to encourage sound design practices with solid, repeatable and integrated testing. In this paper we describe the philosophy behind our process, in the hope that others may learn from it, as well as describe the details of how someone contributes a new design to the NetFPGA repository. ©2009 IEE.","Stanford University, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-70449730563&doi=10.1109%2fMSE.2009.5270838&partnerID=40&md5=4c4e6e5a714d852a998d639f330d5c4f,cited By 2,5270838,10.1109/MSE.2009.5270838,,,2009,"2009 IEEE International Conference on Microelectronic Systems Education, MSE 2009",Encouraging reusable network hardware design,"Covington, G.A. and Gibb, G. and Naous, J. and Lockwood, J.W. and McKeown, N.",conference,Covington200929,,"Designing softwares;  Error prones;  Hardware design;  Networking systems;  New design;  Novel process;  Open source projects;  Open-source;  Reusable design;  Sound designs, Computer software;  Hardware;  Mean square error;  Microelectronics;  Philosophical aspects;  Strain energy, Design",,29-32,9781424444069,,

To bring about synchronized movements of the main 5-axis tape-laying head system and the 3-axis ultrasonic tape-cutting sub-system, the tracking-control method associated with time-based mode attributed to PMAC is applied in different cases. In addition, with the goal of realizing real-time tasks in the software system such as synchronizing motion control and on-off control, the real-time Win 2000 system is adopted. As a device driver for PMAC and PCL, a user graphical interface and a numerical control program interpretation module are also designed.

The primary control functions from code interpretation to NCM generation were encapsulated in the NC pipeline thread. Standard programming interface and software development techniques were employed to guarantee the portability of the NC pipeline thread. The NCMP utilized reconfigurable open hardware to execute the NCM and perform the real-time control functions.

Furthermore, because ELISA requires relatively large sample volumes and protein concentrations, it is difficult using this technique to determine protein content for multiple cytokines from individual samples. Recently, Luminex has developed an open source hardware platform combining flow cytometry- and bead-based antibody capture that is capable of detecting multiple analytes from a single sample. In the present study we employed the Luminex 200® platform to determine the cytokine protein content in discrete brain regions of C57BL/6J mice. In spike-and-recovery experiments, known concentrations of murine recombinant interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α were added either singly or as a mixture of all three to whole brain homogenates containing known quantities of total protein. Spiked samples were assayed for either a single cytokine or for multiple cytokines using 1-plex or 3-plex assay kits, respectively. In whole mouse brain homogenate we recovered between 81% and 103% of the recombinant cytokines. We then injected C57BL/6J mice intraperitoneally with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and sacrificed them 4 h later.

Paper.,English,,01487191,SAE International,"Zwaanenburg, K.; ETASemail: koos.zwaanenburg@etas.com","Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing of automotive control systems is a very mature methodology. Yet there are a number of reasons why it has not yet seen wide proliferation in the commercial vehicle industry. First, until recently, hardware-in-the-loop testing required the use of expensive special-purpose hardware solutions to achieve the needed real-time performance. Second, the development of highly accurate real-time-capable models of diesel engines, transmissions and complete vehicles was prohibitively labor-intensive. Third, the development of test cases required special programming skills. Fourth, the test cases were not portable from one controller program to the next, which limited their re-use. In recent years the performance and user-friendliness of commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and software products have changed to the point that they can now be used in very complex and sophisticated HIL test systems for automobiles and commercial vehicles. As a result, these next generation HIL systems are Built on open hardware and software architectures derived from PCs. This reduces long-term cost of ownership by a substantial amount. Capable of running simulation tools and plant models from many different origins and vendors in real-time. This reduces the effort in developing high-fidelity real-time models for the purpose of HIL testing by a large amount. Capable of running test cases that are implemented in such a way that they can be re-used across many controller programs and across different test benches. This paper will provide details on the three points made above. It will show how one can implement HIL testers for commercial vehicle applications based on COTS hardware and software. It will also show how one can re-use non-real-time plant models for HIL testing. Finally, it will show how one can develop test cases that are language independent, controller program independent, and test bench independent.

Collins Blvd, #2200, Richardson, TX 75080, United States; email: johan.sarkinen@magnetek.com","The open source software movement has been going on for a few decades now. Today, an increasing number of open source solutions enter the market and become valid alternatives to proprietary and closed solutions. Examples include operating systems like Linux and OpenSolaris, back-end solutions (e.g. LAMP - Linux, Apache web server, MySQL database, and Perl/PHP/Python programming languages - are among the most well-known and widely used open source software on the Internet), office applications (e.g. Firefox web browser, Thunderbird email, GIMP graphics, OpenOffice office suite), and complete enterprise systems like Compiere (ERP and CRM) and Mambo content management system (CMS). In addition, a variety of devices increasingly include open source (e.g. cellular phones, network equipment like routers, and Asterisk - a complete IP PBX). The open source culture is about much more than software and includes open source hardware, views on intellectual properties rights, completely changes how products are developed and owned, and how business models are developed. To decide if open source is something for you, a good understanding of what open source really means is necessary. This includes legal aspects (different licenses), availability of support with (hopefully a thriving) user community and commercial for-pay support options, and security. Intellectual properties rights, and the vast number of many types of open source licenses (e.g. GNU General Public License (GPL) and BSD License), is one of the more complex areas when using open source. What can and not can be done, what must be done, and so on, vary between licenses. One effort to bring some order in all this is the Open Source Definition (OSD) from Open Source Initiative (OSI) which lists ten conditions that must be met for an OSI Certified open source license. Today, many companies have already been forced to either remove or release as open source code borrowed by developers without properly complying with licenses. Such ""dirty code"" is increasingly easy to detect via compliance tools used by companies doing this as business. (Not to mention whistle-blowing employees tipping of property owners.) Searching for dirty code is also increasingly part of due diligence in mergers and acquisitions and can add costly delays and lawsuits. The perceived low cost is often a reason for considering open source solutions but the total costs of development (TCD) - including for example licenses, tools, labor, and support - must be considered from initial design, to maintenance, all through the end of life of the product. This paper reviews critical aspects for going open source, including software and hardware, use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) alternatives, system design going from a monlithic, single-binary, firmware to a layered design with operating system, middleware, and user applications. © 2007 IEEE.","Magnetek, Inc., 1701 N.

This paper presents the approach that was recently employed for the development of a network interface module that can be quickly reconfigured to address the changing requirements of network applications, including monitoring of industry standard and proprietary networks, or providing the command and data interface to the data acquisition system itself. This reconfigurability of the module is shown in a review of four different specific applications. © International Foundation for Telemetering, 2007.","L-3 Communications - Telemetry East, Bristol PA, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84877912781&partnerID=40&md5=b0ecfb08a396759515918fe3cc828443,cited By 0,,,,43,2007,Proceedings of the International Telemetering Conference,A Common Solution to Custom Network Applications,"Yin, J. and Dehmelt, C.",conference,Yin2007,,"ARINC-664;  COTS;  G1000;  HSDB;  IP, Avionics;  Ethernet;  Exhibitions;  Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA);  Telemetering equipment, Telemetering",ARINC-664;  COTS;  Ethernet;  FPGA;  G1000;  HSDB;  IP,,,,

Aircraft systems are expensive and must be periodically modernized or upgraded to keep pace with changing threats, missions, and advancing technology. Controls and accessories comprise approximately 1/5 of the total cost of an engine. The main component of the controls system is the Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC). Legacy FADEC systems are both unique and dedicated to a specific weapon system. Today, each FADEC design is unique within its application class. Developing a universal or common standard for engine controls and accessories which includes FADECs would significantly reduce development and support costs across DoD platforms. With engines representing up to 60% of the platform operating costs, modernizing them could provide significant return on investment and avoid the high cost of full system replacement. Obsolescence issues consume considerable funds and manpower and increase the risk to operational missions and the supply pipeline. To minimize the impact obsolesce, technology insertion can provide alternatives that leverage state-of-the art hardware and software to resolve the unavailability of critical parts, enhance performance and decrease cost. These alternatives will be developed through open system architectures with common or ""universal"" standardized inputs and outputs with improved reliability (reduce failures), common and advanced materials, reusable software, decreased number of components, high-reliability modules and improved manufacturing processes. The universal FADEC system for DoD engines will involve a family of common components. It will consist of a real-time operating system and partitioned application software (AS) structure. These components will significantly ease the strain on the supply and maintenance infrastructure. The universal FADEC vision is to develop a common input/output scheme, open hardware and software architecture, and generic circuit modules. A systems approach will be employed, considering sensors, cabling, connectors, and interface standards, as well as the FADEC electronic hardware and software.","Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH 45433-7251, United States; Structures and Controls Branch, Propulsion Directorate (AFRL/PRTS)",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-34249076016&partnerID=40&md5=0addd49d537eb852d69331897e874e20,cited By 4,,,,1,2006,Collection of Technical Papers - AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE 42nd Joint Propulsion Conference,Achieving AFRL universal FADEC vision with open architecture addressing capability and obsolescence for military and commercial applications,"Behbahani, A.R.",conference,Behbahani200617,,"Engine controls;  Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC);  Generic circuit modules, Computer architecture;  Computer software;  Inventory control;  Investments;  Obsolescence, Flight control systems",,17-29,1563478188; 9781563478185,,

Several methods have been described in the literature for measuring the amount of animal movement but most are flawed or expensive. Here, we describe an open source, modular, low-cost, user-friendiy, highly sensitive, non-invasive system that records all the movements of a rat in its cage. Methods: Our activity monitoring system quantifies overall free movements of rodents without any markers, using a commercially available CCTV and a newly designed motion detection software developed on a GNU/Linux-operating computer. The operating principle is that the amount of overall movement of an object can be expressed by the difference in total area occupied by the object in two consecutive picture frames. The application is based on software modules that allow the system to be used in a high-throughput workflow. Documentation, example files, source code and binary files can be freely downloaded from the project website at http://bioinformatics.org/gemvid/. Results: In a series of experiments with objects of pre-defined oscillation frequencies and movements, we documented the sensitivity, reproducibility and stability of our system. We also compared data obtained with our system and data obtained with an Actiwatch device. Finally, to validate the system, results obtained from the automated observation of 6 rats during 7 days in a regular light cycle are presented and are accompanied by a stability test. The validity of this system is further demonstrated through the observation of 2 rats in constant dark conditions that displayed the expected free running of their circadian rhythm. Conclusion: The present study describes a system that relies on video frame differences to automatically quantify overall free movements of a rodent without any markers. It allows the monitoring of rats in their own environment for an extended period of time.

However, the Berkeley Mote was designed for generic applications and therefore the available sensors are not optimised for use in civil infrastructure applications. Acceleration and strain are among the most important physical quantities to judge the health of a structure. Although commercially available sensor boards have accelerometers, their applicability towards civil infrastructure is limited. This paper presents the development of new acceleration and strain sensor boards based on the Berkely-Mote platform and provides experimental verification of their performance within civil infrastructure applications. © 2006 Imperial College Press.","Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana Azcapotzalco, Departamento de Materiales Av, San Pablo, CP, 02200, Mexico; Department of Civil and Environmental, Engineering University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign 205 N.

Navig.,English,,,,"Greenberg, A.; Portland State Aerospace SocietyUnited States","Open source software running on inexpensive, commercially available GPS receivers promises to cut the expense and restrictions of developing extended GPS applications dramatically. Extended GPS applications, such as keeping GPS satellite signal lock in high-dynamic environments or deep coupling of inertial data, require direct access to the receiver's hardware. This access is usually only provided by very expensive and restrictive development kits, many of which still do not grant the developer direct access to the receiver chip set. Our software allows GPS developers to convert an inexpensive, commercially available GPS receiver into an open source development system that provides complete access to the receiver's hardware. The software, licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), is called GPL-GPS. This paper describes the motivations, principles and technical development of the GPL-GPS project. This includes choosing a GPS receiver chipset, choosing a receiver board, and porting the software necessary to make a fully functional open source GPS receiver and receiver development system. The paper concludes with results from a static positioning test, results from a GPS simulator running a simulated sounding rocket trajectory, and future work. GPL-GPS currently supports the Zarlink GP4020, a 12-channel L1 C/A GPS receiver baseband processor with an integrated 32 bit ARM7TDMI microprocessor, because of its open and extensive documentation. Commercially available receivers, coupled with an open hardware carrier board, can create a full featured development kit for less than US$300.

This instrumentation, which consists of physically separate building blocks or modules, provides the opportunity to reduce the system's overall hardware content by eliminating common hardware functionality located within each traditional instrument. This modular design provides opportunities for lower lifecycle cost, smaller physical packages and increased capabilities through module upgrades. However, the design of synthetic instrumentation and its integration into an ATE system poses technical challenges not typically seen with traditional instrumentation. Traditional instrument developers are now faced with the challenge of determining how their existing and future modules, for example a digitizer or waveform generator, satisfy a portion of the requirements of a synthetic instrument. ATE developers are challenged to identify the proper set of modules, primarily Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS), that together satisfy the system level requirements. In addition, they must address instrumentation concurrency, synchronization, switching, and develop a software and hardware architecture that supports future upgrades as technology advances. Each of these issues requires a strong system engineering discipline that can develop a robust system architecture. In 2002 SEI began a program to integrate synthetic instrumentation that provided the functionality of a spectrum analyzer, A/D converter, counter timer, UART and AVMUX into a legacy Air Force Test Station. In 2003 SEI continued with an additional program that consisted of design and development of a synthetic instrument that provided the functionality of a power meter, spectrum analyzer, frequency time interval counter, oscilloscope and digital multi meter. During each of these programs SEI worked directly with commercial instrument manufacturers, electrical designers and the military to establish the system requirements and resulting architecture.

Some of the most important developed projects are OSACA in Europe, OSEC in Japan and OMAC in the US. All these efforts are directed to the definition of an open architecture for controllers of manufacturing systems. The PC (personal computer) as the control platform facilitates the conectivity, standardization and availability of components, and the cost reduction. An aspect, however, remains scarcely analized: the application of these concepts on equipments designed with a propietary control structure. An open control system for an SCARA industrial robot YAMAHA YK7000 has been developed to analize its viability and evaluate difficulties and limitations. The controller follows the guidelines defined by the OMAC architecture (Open Modular Architecture for Controllers). The control functions were implemented on a dual platform (two PCs): The first PC supports the critical functions, executing the paths planning and axes control tasks with a commercial axes control card. The second one supports the functions of user interfacing with the user and other non-critical time applications. Both computers are connected by a TCP/IP link.","Inst. Tecn.

Health Monit., IWSHM",English,,,DEStech Publications,,"In recent years, Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has emerged as an important research area in civil engineering. To investigate both local and global damage criteria, a dense array of sensors is anticipated to be required for large civil engineering structures. Traditional centralized data acquisition systems do not provide a scalable approach, since the shear number of accompanying wires, fiber optic cables, or other physical transmission medium may be prohibitive. Wireless communications have the potential to significantly impact monitoring systems. To assist in dealing with the large amount of data that will be generated, on-board processing at the sensor allows a portion of the computation to be done locally on the sensor's embedded microprocessor. The Mica Mote platform, along with Tiny Operating System (TinyOS) developed at the University of California at Berkeley offers for the first time, an open hardware/software environment for broad smart sensing research. However, because the accelerometers on the existing sensor boards have both poor low frequency sensitivity and high noise density, their suitability for civil engineering applications is unclear. This paper presents results for a new sensor board employing an SD-1221 accelerometer, which overcomes many of the deficiencies of the existing sensor. Finally, a number of the challenges still remaining are identified. Copyright © 2003 by DEStech Publications, Inc. All right reserved.","Dept. of Civil Eng. and Geol.

For user, it is also possible to include algorithm in the existing structure, like the assembling of blocks in the simulation programs. Results can be followed by the real-time display of the desired system variables, which can also be saved for the later processing.

Also communication connections - paths are destined in such a manner that the fastest possible transfer is enabled.

The main objective of the testbed is to provide researchers with a robot control system possessing an open hardware structure, high computational capacity, and good software programmability, such that various advanced control schemes intended for robots can be implemented in real-time and evaluated through physical experiments rather than simulation. On this testbed, different control schemes including regressor based adaptive control of the robot performing tracking tasks are implemented. Dynamics of robot actuators are incorporated in the experiments. The performance of these control schemes is quantitatively evaluated. For comparison purposes, a conventional PD controller is also implemented independently in each joint of the robot. This paper outlines the hardware configuration and software support of the testbed. Adaptive control scheme incorporating actuator dynamics is described and experimental results are presented. These experiments show that advanced control schemes can be effectively used to improve the performance of an industrial robot in a significant manner.","Univ of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0027813997&partnerID=40&md5=bed496905dda8397378ca8ad59115388,cited By 1,,,,4,1993,"Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics",Real-time control experiments using an industrial robot retrofitted with an open-structure controller,"Zhou, Yuchen and de Silva, Clarence W.",conference,Zhou1993553,PICYE,"Actuators;  Adaptive control systems;  Algorithms;  Computer hardware;  Computer software;  Control nonlinearities;  Equations of motion;  Linear control systems;  Real time systems;  Torque control;  Tracking (position);  Two term control systems, Custom built controller;  High computational capacity;  Open hardware structure;  Real time control;  Robot control system;  Robotic testbed, Robotics",,553-559,0780309111,Anon,

The market was entered first with software adapted from other industries, such as mapmaking or publishing. In the next phase, software was developed specifically for the PCB tooling task. These systems were all 'closed' and usually ran on proprietary hardware. The next step, in the late 80's, was the move to standard hardware platforms. Soon, almost all CAM systems were available either on DOS based PC's or Unix based workstation platforms. The vendors of these systems presented them as the complete solution to the PCB CAM process. However, users soon learned that no CAM system could completely meet all of their needs. At the start of the 90's we see systems that are 'closed' to outside access running on 'open' hardware platforms with many third party software products trying to fill in the gaps in these systems.","Excellon Automation, Santa Ana, United States",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0025838844&partnerID=40&md5=9dfd559d9c1479a840ff5d856fb6523c,cited By 0,,,,2,1991,National Electronic Packaging and Production Conference-Proceedings of the Technical Program (West and East),Semi-custom CAM.

Inc, Houston, United States","Current programmable logic controllers (PLCs) have a broader range of flexibility than ever before. Advances in technologies with increased memory, open hardware architectures and common communication protocols allow for more complex control applications. In particular, expanded RLL (Relay Ladder Logic) programming languages incorporate high level commands for data manipulation and math algorithms such as table creation, alternate numeric conversions and PID functionality to name just a few. The ladder language has evolved to allow for structured programming which permits greater capabilities especially in control loop repeated function reusability. Computers interfaced through 'real time' local area networks (LAN's) can archive data, store recipes, log events, log alarms, provide process analysis functions, and a variety of other applications. This paper will concentrate on a GE Fanuc Automation system utilizing these new emerging abilities for process control systems incorporating up to 64 loops (or more) of control. PLCs offer flexibility in design, installation, and maintenance for the system without the need for dependent vendor service and support for configuration, implementation, and modification.
