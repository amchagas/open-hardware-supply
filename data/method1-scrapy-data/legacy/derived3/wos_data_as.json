The proposed approach exploits the ability of mobile robots to navigate in unstructured, cluttered and potentially hostile environments using calibrated odometry information, proximity sensor data and a fuzzy logic engine. A key advantage to this technique is its simplicity over similar navigation systems discussed in the literature. The simplification stems from the fact that only the previous traveled position of the robot needs to be tracked to reach to the target position.

First, this paper identifies the main items possessing the large portion of SCA-based SDR handheld embedded system by the experiment on the target platform which is similar to a commercial mobile handheld system. Both the world interoperabillity for microwave access (WiMAX) and high speed downlink packet access (HS-DPA) waveform software packages are used as an SCA waveform application. This paper also presents the results of the relative binary size distribution of SCA software resources for looking for the major elements making an SCA-based SDR handheld embedded system heavier. As a result, when focusing on the relative weight portion of SCA core framework (CF), the SCA CF takes 16% up and others have 84% out of the whole binary size distribution of SCA software resources. The results of the experiment give us notice that the weight portion of SCA CF is minor and compatible with the overall software binary size needs of an SCA-based SDR handheld embedded system, on the other hand, the practical problem on the lightweight is in a common object request broker architecture (CORBA) and extensible markup language (XML) parser resources. Second, this paper describes an important feature for implementing a high speed broadband radio to an SCA waveform and presents the performance evaluation results of the SCA port communication on both power PC (PPC) 405 and x86 processor platforms. The PPC 405 platform, which is similar to a commercial mobile handset, takes the value of average round trip time (RTT) with a maximum of thirty six millisecond. The x86 platform, however, which is analogous to a server platform, maintains stable micro-second resolution. From our experiments, we observe that rapid SCA port communication, sufficiently less than the frame length of high-speed broadband radios, should be provided for serving those radio services in a commercial handheld system based on the SCA.", "Requirements for modern and future control systems for large projects like International Linear Collider demand high availability for control system components.

Even strategies designed with specific social goals in mind rarely succeed unless there is great attention to the details. For instance some observers have claimed that tight intellectual property (IP) protection prevents developing countries from accessing the benefits of emerging technologies and they should, therefore, develop other strategies. In this chapter, Dhanaraj Thakur explores one such strategy-an \"open access\" system of IP in developing countries. He uses open source software to illustrate the range of possible property arrangements. He notes, however, that the application of these principles in nanotechnology has thus far been limited and that earlier studies have shown that open source technologies still require significant complementary facilities and skills that are less likely to be available in developing country contexts. While open. source might be part of a strategy that can help a developing country capitalize on nanotechnology, Thakur argues that it will not be a panacea.-eds.", "Pharyngoesophageal diverticulum is a rare complication following anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). Dysphagia is a well-documented complication associated with ACDF. It may result postoperatively from a variety of etiologies, including hardware displacement, pharyngeal edema, or vocal fold paresis. One rare cause of persistent dysphagia is the formation of a hypopharyngeal diverticulum, reported in the literature in 9 previous cases. Such diverticula after ACDF surgery may have pathogenesis that is distinct from that of typical Zenker diverticula. We report 3 new cases of hypopharyngeal diverticula in patients who underwent revision ACDFs. Variables assessed included age, sex, level of fusion, ACDF-related complications, and diverticulum management. Two patients underwent successful open surgical diverticulectomy and cricopharyngeal myotomy. In the third case, the patient had a small diverticulum close to the surgical hardware and minimal symptoms and was managed conservatively. Our cases, combined with the 9 previous cases, demonstrate commonalities, particularly with regard to the risk of revision spinal surgery and infection and subsequent hypopharyngeal diverticula development. Hypopharyngeal diverticulum can occur as a complication of ACDF and should be considered in patients with persistent dysphagia after surgery. In this patient population, open resection and cricopharyngeal myotomy are recommended.", "System-on-Chip (SoC) design is an integration of multi million transistors in a single chip for alleviating time to market and reduce the cost of the design.

These include expansions from software into general culture through 'Free Culture' movements and, more recently, expansions from software into hardware and design. This article provides a critical perspective on the democratic potential of these broader 'open' contribution structures by examining how open source contributions to both software and hardware increase the opportunities for democratic participation in production, governance and knowledge exchange. By analysing attempts to 'open source' the sharing of hardware designs, it also notes the limitations of this democratization. The insights developed in the article nuance the relationship between open source cultures and commercial and market structures, identifying how the generative opportunities created by certain aspects of open source contribution structures increase the potential for democratizing production of communication tools, but also how incongruities across different open-source cultures and communities of practice limit the democratic potential of these processes.", "Open source hardware is a type of hardware where the schematics and designs are made unrestricted and available to all.

Thus, it is suggested that ethical and political convictions can be crucial for enabling collective innovation processes. This highlighting of normativity is intended as a complement to the common premise in Innovation Studies that users innovate to satisfy unfulfilled needs. In opposition to this view, it is argued that the needs of users are not a constant but something which emerge together with the transformation of the user community and the technology in question. Particular focus is placed on the tension between, on one hand, the norms and ethical-political motives of the user community, and, on the other hand, the needs satisfied through product development, both stemming from the same innovation process.", "Eye tracking has long held the promise of being a useful methodology for human computer interaction. However, a number of barriers have stood in the way of the integration of eye tracking into everyday applications, including the intrusiveness, robustness, availability and price of eye-tracking systems. To lower these barriers, we have developed the openEyes system. The system consists of an open-hardware design for a digital eye tracker that can be built from low-cost off-the-shelf components, and a set of open-source software tools for digital image capture, manipulation, and analysis in eye-tracking applications. We expect that the availability of this system will facilitate the development of eye-tracking applications and the eventual integration of eye tracking into the next generation of everyday human computer interfaces. We discuss the methods and technical challenges of low-cost eye tracking as well as the design decisions that produced our current system.", "The present contribution proposes to transfer the main principles of open source software development to a new context: conceptual modelling; an activity closely related to software development. The goal of the proposed \"open model\" approach is to collaboratively develop reference models for everyone to copy, use and refine in a public process. We briefly introduce conceptual modelling and reference models, discuss the cornerstones of an open modelling process, and propose a procedure for initiating,: growing and sustaining an open model project. The paper concludes with a discussion of potential benefits and pitfalls.", "GJK is one of the main methods for distance calculations between convex objects. In this article, the adaptation of GJK for deformable object collision detection is proposed. Although the original method is only suited for distance calculations, the proposed method is capable of nding the colliding triangle pairs between two cotinuously deforming virtual objects in real time. Furthermore, it handles all deformation types at no extra time cost and it allows the client application to add, or remove triangles from the considered object meshes at run time with no extra overhead for the collision detection. The proposed method is very exible in many aspects, making it an ideal choice for virtual reality and haptic applications.", "Tamper-resistant software (TRS) consists of two functional components: tamper detection and tamper response. Although both are equally critical to the effectiveness of a TRS system, past research has focused primarily on the former, while giving little thought to the latter. Not surprisingly, many successful breaks of commercial TRS systems found their first breaches at the relatively naive tamper-response modules. In this paper, we describe a novel tamper-response system that evades hacker detection by introducing delayed, probabilistic failures in a program. This is accomplished by corrupting the program's internal state at well-chosen locations. Our tamper-response system smoothly blends in with the program and leaves no noticeable traces behind, making it very difficult for a hacker to detect its existence. The paper also presents empirical results to demonstrate the efficacy of our system.", ["Purpose - The democratization of invention is a long lasting desire for the advancement of society. Having access to education and the means of production appears as the major factors for the implementation of this goal. 3D printing is a revolutionary technology that has the potential to bring digital manufacturing to everyone. However, the rise of personal fabrication requires an increase in printing quality, a reduction on machine cost and an increase in knowledge shared by the open hardware community. The purpose of this paper is to explore the development of a new Open Hardware printer project to address these points.", "Design/methodology/approach - The authors have designed and constructed a low-cost photopolymer-based 3D printer called BeamMaker. The printer is connected to a host computer and a digital-light-processing projector. This work details the design process and how improvements were implemented to reach good printing quality. The authors provide public access to the instructions, software, source code, parts list, user manual and STL and CAD files.", "Findings - The BeamMaker printer can build objects with a high surface quality that is comparable to the quality obtained by industrial photopolymer-based 3D printers. When testing the ability to print a sample cylinder, the printer shows higher accuracy when compared to other personal 3D printers. These findings are encouraging considering the low cost of the system.", "Research limitations/implications - The printing failure rate of the system has not been measured to date. The system requires some improvements to produce large objects.", "Practical implications - The printer cost is just USD380. This is five to eight times less expensive than popular personal 3D printers available today. The cost is 30 times less expensive than a personal photopolymer 3D printer produced by a main commercial company and yet producing results of similar quality. The authors expect good avenues for collaboration from the open-source community to continue improving these systems. Social implications - The high cost of current personal 3D printers prevents users from developing countries from entering into the open hardware trend. A dramatic reduction in printer cost such as that explored in this work might contribute to the real democratization of personal fabrication.", "Originality/value - The authors report on the status of three other photopolymer-based personal 3D printer projects. To the best of the authors' knowledge, BeamMaker is the first fully open hardware 3D printer project which uses this technology."], "There have been several exciting developments in the technologies commonly used n in the hardware hacking community. Advances in low cost additive-manufacturing processes (i.e. 3D-printers) and the development of open-hardware projects, which have produced inexpensive and easily programmable micro-controllers and micro-computers (i.e. Arduino and Raspberry Pi) have opened a new door for individuals seeking to make their own devices. Here we describe the potential for these technologies to reduce costs in construction and development of submillimeter/millimeter astronomical instrumentation. Specifically we have begun a program to measure the optical properties of the custom plastics used in 3D-printers as well as the printer accuracy and resolution to assess the feasibility of directly printing sub/millimeter transmissive optics. We will also discuss low cost designs for cryogenic temperature measurement and control utilizing Arduino and Raspberry Pi.", "In this paper, we discuss how a flourishing scene of DIY makers is turning visions of tangible and ubiquitous computing into products. Drawing on long-term multi-sited ethnographic research and active participation in DIY making, we provide insights into the social, material, and economic processes that undergird this transition from prototypes to products. The contribution of this paper is three-fold. First, we show how DIY maker practice is illustrative of a broader \"return to\" and interest in physical materials. This has implications for HCI research that investigates questions of materiality. Second, we shed light on how hackerspaces and hardware start-ups are experimenting with new models of manufacturing and entrepreneurship. We argue that we have to take seriously these maker practices, not just as hobbyist or leisure practice, but as a professionalizing field functioning in parallel to research and industry labs. Finally, we end with reflections on the role of HCI researchers and designers as DIY making emerges as a site of HCI innovation. We argue that HCI is positioned to provide critical reflection, paired with a sensibility for materials, tools and design methods.", ["Robotics teaching is nowadays limited by the expensiveness of the electronic material required. In this paper, a new low-cost, user friendly robotic system has been developed. This system provides an advanced mobile robotics teaching frame using cheap hardware and software resources. This platform consists on a little mobile robot able to navigate through the environment avoiding obstacles and performing a map of its surrounding. This system performs these tasks using open hardware and software tools. The robot, made from an Arduino board, cheap sensors, motors and wheels, has been programmed using C++ language on Arduino and ROS. The system communicates in real time with a PC where the map is drawn using OpenCV libraries.", "Regarding to the hardware, the robot has the structure of a PopBot-168 Arduino kit, which consists of a circular structure and two motors connected to their corresponding wheels. The robot also has two encoders and a magnetometer to perform location task. The processor is an Arduino Mega board. The system features two infrared sensors that get the distances of robot's environment in every directions due to a servomotor that moves them.", "The developed robot is able to perform a map of its environment and draw it in a computer. The communication between the robot and the computer is performed using ROS. This project has managed to introduce a ROS node on the Arduino board. In the computer there are another two nodes, one for draw the map and another which decide where to move.", "Finally, as experimental results, an example of how the robot works building a 2-dimensional reconstruction from an environment is shown. Students can learn about the problem of auto-location and other difficulties due to robotics itself. It is also a very good mechanism to learn from the beginning to design, assemble and program a mobile robot; use and gather data from the sensors."], "In this paper we discuss the motivation and challenges raised by the desire to consider the morphology as an experimental variable on real robotic platforms as well as allowing reproducibility and diffusion in the scientific community. In this context, we present an alternative design and production methodology that we have applied to the conception of Poppy, the first complete 3D printed open-source and open-hardware humanoid robot. Robust and accessible, it allows exploring quickly and easily the fabrication, the programming and the experimentation of various robotic morphologies. Both hardware and software are open-source, and a web platform allows interdisciplinary contributions, sharing and collaborations. Finally we conduct an experiment to explore the impact of four different foot morphologies on the robot's dynamic when it makes a footstep. We show that such experimentation can easily be achieved and shared in couple of days at almost no cost.", "The field of GIS (S for Systems, Sciences, Services, and Studies) is at a cross-road in the early 2010s. Aiming to link the multiple visions for the next phase of GIS development, this article suggests that the emerging open GIS should serve as a guiding concept. Contextualized in the broader literature of open science, this article proposes open GIS should include eight dimensions related to data, software, hardware, standards, research, publication, funding, and education. For the GIS community, open GIS offers four exciting opportunities: (1) technology-driven opportunities for addressing challenges posed by the (spatial) big data deluge; (2) application-led opportunities for confronting the problems of a rapidly changing planet; (3) curiosity-inspired, crowd-powered opportunities for the development of an open and geographic citizen science; and (4) education-focused opportunities for implementing the vision of a spatial university. Although there are academic, legal, social/political, and environmental impediments for the practice of open GIS, open GIS will become increasingly important in shaping our research and educational agendas in the future.", "The last decade has witnessed a significant reduction in prices and an increased performance of electronic components, coupled with the influence of the shift towards the generation of open resources, both in terms of knowledge (open access), programs (open-source software), and components (open hardware). This situation has produced different effects in today's society, among which is the empowerment of citizens, called makers, who are themselves able to generate citizen science or build assembly developments. Situated in the context described above, the current study follows a Do-It-Yourself (DIY) approach. In this way, it attempts to define a conceptual design of an Internet of Things (IoT) node, which is reproducible at both physical and behavioral levels, to build IoT nodes which can cover any scenario. To test this conceptual design, this study proposes a sensorization node to monitor meteorological phenomena. The node is called SEnviro (node) and features different improvements such as: the possibility of remote updates using Over-the-Air (OTA) updates; autonomy, using 3G connectivity, a solar panel, and applied energy strategies to prolong its life; and replicability, because it is made up of open hardware and other elements such as 3D-printed pieces. The node is validated in the field of smart agriculture, with the aim of monitoring different meteorological phenomena, which will be used as input to disease detection models to detect possible diseases within vineyards.", "Road traffic and its impacts affect various aspects of wellbeing with safety, congestion and pollution being of significant concern in cities. Although there have been a large number of works done in the field of traffic data collection, there are several barriers which restrict the collection of traffic data at higher resolution in the cities. Installation and maintenance costs can act as a disincentive to use existing methods (e.g., loop detectors, video analysis) at a large scale and hence limit their deployment to only a few roads of the city. This paper presents an approach for vehicle counting using a low cost, simple and easily installable system. In the proposed system, vehicles (i.e., bicycles, cars, trucks) are counted by means of variations in the WiFi signals. Experiments with the developed hardware in two different scenarios-low traffic (i.e., 400 objects) and heavy traffic roads (i.e., 1000 objects)-demonstrate its ability to detect cars and trucks. The system can be used to provide estimates of vehicle numbers for streets not covered by official traffic monitoring techniques in future smart cities.", "Artificial vision algorithms are approaching human performance in many respects. However, their computational demands are also growing, which constraints their use in mobile and time-sensitive robots. Biological vision presents a well known practical solution. Specifically, primates limit the computational demands of vision by processing only small parts of the scene in detail, and frequently reorienting the eyes to different locations. Artificial vision is much more power-intensive than biological vision, so this strategy is likely to be increasingly relevant to robots, as they become more visually sophisticated. To facilitate progress and reduce duplication of work in this area, we have developed a 7-degree-of-freedom robotic head that supports such rapid saccade-like camera movements, and we are releasing the design files under an open-hardware license. The system supports C-mount cameras, large foveated lenses, and liquid lenses that allow rapid changes in focus distance. It also has a stereo baseline that is roughly the same as that of humans, to support stereo processing of nearby objects in grasping and manipulation tasks. The main contributions of this work are the mechanical design, and the demonstration that its stereo baseline, range of motion, and saccade velocity are similar to those of primate systems. The main general advantages over existing robotic heads are speed and the open-hardware license. The system would also be an ideal platform for future research that aims to replicate the performance of primate vision systems.", "Timely detection of cardiac arrhythmia is critical for diagnosis and treatment of heart related disorders. ECG signal provide valuble insight into heart functioning and enable diagnosis of arrhythmia conditions. An open hardware based system for the automated classification of heart conditions was developed. The Raspberry Pi 3b (RPi3b) single board computer was used to analyse the ECG signal and identify normal or abnormal heart conditions. The developed system can independently acquire ECG signals and classify arrythmia using ANN algorithm running on the RPi3b. The system was tested using MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. Realtime ECG signal acquisition and classification was also carried out.", "Present study reveals the low concentrations (similar to 4 ppm) of pesticide sensing vis-a-vis degradation of pesticides with the help of nontoxic zinc oxide quantum dots (QD). In our study, we have taken four different pesticides viz., aldrin, tetradifon, glyphosate, and atrazine, which are widely used in agriculture and have structural dissimilarities/diversity. By using optical sensing techniques such as steady state and time-resolved fluorescence, we have analyzed the detailed exciton dynamics of QD in the presence of different pesticides. It has been found that the pesticide containing good leaving groups ( Cl) can interact with QD promptly and has high binding affinity (similar to 10(7) M-1). The different binding signatures of QD with different pesticides enable us to differentiate between the pesticides. Time resolved fluorescence spectroscopy provides significant variance (similar to 150-300 ns) for different pesticides. Furthermore, a large variation (10(5) Omega to 7 X 10(4) Omega) in the resistance of QD in the presence of different pesticides was revealed by electrochemical sensing technique. Moreover, during the interaction with pesticides, QD can also act as a photocatalyst to degrade pesticides. Present investigation explored the fact that the rate of degradation is positively affected by the binding affinity, i.e., the greater the binding, the greater is the degradation. What is more, both optical and electrochemical measurements of QD, in tandem, as described in our study could be utilized as the pattern recognition sensor for detection of several pesticides.", null, "This paper describes the initial development of a low-cost Lagrangian drifter based on solar panels, ultracapacitor and open hardware-software platform.

The challenge is to consider all of the different structures and components available and build the optimal power management on a microscale. The purpose of this paper is to streamline the design process by creating a novel reconfigurable testbed called Medlay. First, we propose a uniform interface for management functions e.g., power conversion, energy storing and power routing. This interface results in a clear layout because power and status pins are strictly separated, and inputs and outputs have fixed positions. Medlay is the ready-to-use and open-hardware platform based on the interface. It consists of a base board and small modules incorporating e.g., dc-dc converters, power switches and supercapacitors. Measurements confirm that Medlay represents a system on one circuit board, as parasitic effects of the interconnections are negligible. The versatility regarding different setups on the testbed is determined to over 250,000 combinations by layout graph grammar. Lastly, we underline the applicability by recreating three state-of-the-art systems with the testbed. In conclusion, Medlay facilitates building and testing power management in a very compact, clear and extensible fashion.", ["On the race toward exascale supercomputing systems are facing important challenges which limit the efficiency of the system.

However, outside of neuroscience, the impact of optogenetics has been limited by a lack of user-friendly, flexible, accessible hardware. Here, we engineer the Light Plate Apparatus (LPA), a device that can deliver two independent 310 to 1550 nm light signals to each well of a 24-well plate with intensity control over three orders of magnitude and millisecond resolution. Signals are programmed using an intuitive web tool named Iris. All components can be purchased for under $400 and the device can be assembled and calibrated by a non-expert in one day. We use the LPA to precisely control gene expression from blue, green, and red light responsive optogenetic tools in bacteria, yeast, and mammalian cells and simplify the entrainment of cyanobacterial circadian rhythm. The LPA dramatically reduces the entry barrier to optogenetics and photobiology experiments.", "In this work, a new open hardware interface based on Arduino to read electromotive force (emf) from potentiometric detectors is presented. The interface has been fully designed with the open code philosophy and all documentation will be accessible on web. The paper describes a comprehensive project including the electronic design, the firmware loaded on Arduino, and the Java-coded graphical user interface to load data in a computer (PC or Mac) for processing. The prototype was tested by measuring the calibration curve of a detector. As detection element, an active poly(vinyl chloride)based membrane was used, doped with cetyltrimethylammonium dodecylsulphate (CTA(+)-DS-). The experimental measures of emf indicate Nernstian behaviour with the CTA(+) content of test solutions, as it was described in the literature, proving the validity of the developed prototype. A comparative analysis of performance was made by using the same chemical detector but changing the measurement instrumentation.

The efficient use of irrigation water is a key factor in coping with the food demands of an increasing world population and with the negative effects of climate change on water resource availability in many areas. In this complex context, it is important that farmers can rely on instruments and practices that enable a better management of water at the field scale, whatever the irrigation method they adopt.", "In this paper, we present an open-hardware device based on the Arduino technology that was developed to allow the continuous monitoring of soil water potential in the root zone for supporting irrigation scheduling at the field scale.

The proposed Raspberry Pi-Arduino-based model architecture ensures lower cost while allowing some scalability, inter operability, portability and interchangeability to the low-cost online laboratory. Remotely controlled lab provides training skills in bio-inspired robotics. Our previous studies had shown that the implementation of remotely controlled online labs in the curriculum improved active learning among students, collaboration, and augmented problem solving skills.

The advantages with FOSS included a significantly lower cost and se:liability for concurrent usage. The paper also reports on usage analysis and common issues in both cases of implementations.", "Selective openness allows a firm to sell a systemic innovation that combines both open and proprietary technologies. Such firm strategies are now common for open source software and other information goods. However, they pose conceptual and practical uncertainties for hardware-focused companies, particularly as research on open hardware has emphasized community rather than firm success. Here we study firm openness in 3D printing, with a case study of how MakerBot Industries leveraged external communities and selective openness become the consumer market leader. After reviewing the literature on systemic innovation and selective openness, we document the proprietary strategies of a dozen startup companies during the first two decades of the 3D printing industry. We contrast this to the open hardware, software and content strategy that MakerBot's founders used to enter and grow the consumer market from 2009 onward. We show how MakerBot shifted to a selectively open, systemic innovation strategy that complemented proprietary hardware and software with open user-generated content from its Thingiverse online community. From this, we suggest the inherent complementarity of selective openness strategies between open and proprietary components, and conclude with predictions as to when and how a startup or incumbent firm will combine open and proprietary elements.

This program was developed in a senior class at the high school Liceo Paschini in Tolmezzo (northeast Italy). The students under the supervision of their physics teacher and seismologists, used an Arduino board, ADXL345 accelerometers, and open-source software to create a low-cost seismometer able to record local strong motion. In this article, we provide a \"how-to\" (instructional) guide to enable other students to reproduce the experiment. Certain introductory lessons in computer sciences and electronics were required for the students to acquire the necessary skills and to fill gaps in their background knowledge. In addition, lectures by seismologists and specific laboratory activities allowed the class to explore different aspects of the physics of earthquakes, particularly of the seismic waves, and to become familiar with seismic-hazard topics through inquiry-based learning. We believe that this exercise is a good example of how earthquake issues can be taught through a multidisciplinary approach in subjects traditionally covered by scientific and technological disciplines.", "Although theoretically the patent system is meant to bolster innovation, the current United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is cumbersome and involves a significant time investment to locate inactive patents less than 20 years old. This article reports on the development of an open source database to find these public domain ideas. First, a search strategy is explained. Then the operation and use of free and open source software are detailed to meet the needs of open hardware innovators. Finally, a case study is presented to demonstrate the utility of the approach with 3-D printing. The results showed how the Free Inactive Patent Search enables users to search using plain language text to find public domain concepts and then provides a hyperlinked list of ideas that takes users to the USPTO database for the patent for more information. All of the source code to operate the search and the website are open source themselves and provided in the public domain for free.

The platform proposed here is intended for research which trades smaller population size with more sophisticated individual robot capabilities. The validation of proposed swarm robotic algorithms using real-world hardware is essential, but is fraught with difficulty due to the expense and complexity of developing and maintaining multiple operational units. A number of open hardware platforms have been proposed, although most prioritize small size and low cost over advanced capabilities such as vision. We are interested in a number of different research directions which utilize vision as a core capability and find the existing open hardware platforms to be insufficient (and existing commercial platforms too expensive). In this paper we describe a set of desirable characteristics for an open, extensible visually-guided robot platform.

An analog front end (AFE) stage is designed and developed for the acquisition, conditioning, and processing of power signals. This AFE can be stacked on available quadcore embedded ARM boards. The proposed hardware is capable of adapting voltage signals up to 800 V AC/DC and currents up to thousands of amperes using different probes. The oZm device is described as a fully autonomous open-source system for the computation and visualization of PQ events and consumed/generated energy, along with full details of its hardware implementation. It also has the ability to send data to central cloud management systems. Given the small size of the hardware design and considering that it allows measurements under a wide range of operating conditions, oZm can be used both as bulk metering or as metering/submetering device for individual appliances. The design is released as open hardware and therefore is presented to the community as a powerful tool for general usage.", "As conventional fluorescence microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy generally produce images with blurring at the upper and lower planes along the z-axis due to non-focal plane image information, the observation of biological images requires \"deconvolution.\" Therefore, a microscope system's individual blur function (point spread function) is determined theoretically or by actual measurement of microbeads and processed mathematically to reduce noise and eliminate blurring as much as possible. Here the author describes the use of open-source software and open hardware design to build a deconvolution microscope at low cost, using readily available software and hardware. The advantage of this method is its cost-effectiveness and ability to construct a microscope system using commercially available optical components and open-source software.

High-energy atmospheric physics is a newly opened research domain which focuses on research of terrestrial gamma-ray flashes that can measurably contribute to the aircraft-crew irradiation according to the preliminary computer simulations. High-mountain observatories are suitable places for both the continual monitoring of cosmic radiation and the detection of ionizing radiation generated by lightning. Liulin Mobile Dosimetry Unit (MDU) is a silicon diode based radiation dosimeter developed by the team of Tsvetan Dachev at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, initially for the MIR space station. It is widely used as an instrument for radiation monitoring on board aircraft, on high altitude observatories as well as for example for ion fragmentation studies. The AIRDOS dosimeter is an open source device for measurement in low intensity mixed ionising radiation fields. In its aircraft version, it houses silicon PIN diode as a radiation detector, an electronics for conversion of the signal to the pulse-height spectra, Global Positioning System (GPS) module, memory card and batteries for one-month monitoring. The hardware design of AIRDOS is built on the Open hardware modular platform MLAB. the firmware is written in Open Software platform Processing. Full documentation is freely available. Two AIRDOS devices have been installed at Basic Enviromental Observtory (BEO) Moussala in December 2017, complementing the radiation and environment monitoring instruments already available, including the Liulin MDU.

Compared to open-source medical software, open (and open-source) electronic hardware has been less published in peer-reviewed literature. In this review, we explore the developments, significance, and advantages of using open platform electronic hardware for medical devices. Open hardware electronics platforms offer not just shorter development times, reduced costs, and customization; they also offer a key potential advantage which current commercial medical devices lack-seamless data sharing for machine learning and artificial intelligence. We explore how various electronic platforms such as microcontrollers, single board computers, field programmable gate arrays, development boards, and integrated circuits have been used by researchers to design medical devices. Researchers interested in designing low cost, customizable, and innovative medical devices can find references to various easily available electronic components as well as design methodologies to integrate those components for a successful design.", "This paper presents the design and hardware implementation of open-source hardware dedicated to smart converter systems development. Smart converters are simple or interleaved converters. They are equipped with controllers that are able to online impedance match for the maximum power transfer. These conversion systems are particularly feasible for photovoltaic and all renewable energies systems working in continuous changing operating conditions. Smart converters represent promising solutions in recent energetic scenarios, in fact their application is deepening and widening. In this context, the availability of a hardware platform could represent a useful tool. The platform was conceived and released as an open hardware instrument for academy and industry to benefit from the improvements brought by the researchers' community. The usage of a novel, open-source platform would allow many developers to design smart converters, focusing on algorithms instead of electronics, which could result in a better overall development ecosystem and rapid growth in the number of smart converter applications. The platform itself is proposed as a benchmark in the development and testing of different maximum power point tracking algorithms. The designed system is capable of accurate code implementations, allowing the testing of different current and voltage-controlled algorithms for different renewable energies systems. The circuit features a bi-directional radio frequency communication channel that enables real-time reading of measurements and parameters, and remote modification of both algorithm types and settings. The proposed system was developed and successfully tested in laboratory with a solar module simulator and with real photovoltaic generators. Experimental results indicate state-of-art performances as a converter, while enhanced smart features pave the way to system-level management, real-time diagnostics, and on-the-flight parameters change. Furthermore, the deployment feasibility allows different combinations and arrangements of several energy sources, converters (both single and multi-converters), and modulation strategies.

The second contribution is the improved performance in terms of resolution and search range achieved by adaptive frame interval and advanced search algorithm. The final contribution is a systematical strategy for parameter selection to fully utilize the hardware resources and optimize the performance in different contexts. The performance was benchmarked against the PX4FLOW and GPS. Results indicated that the proposed algorithm achieved levels of robustness exceeding that of PX4FLOW in measuring velocity. Also, the integrated trajectory agreed with the position calculated by an on-board GPS system.", "Since its introduction in 1992, Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) has evolved to become a worldwide standard in mobile telephony. Security in GSM, albeit being one of the most important issues, has not yet been scrutinized to a level it deserves owing mainly to the expensive hardware requirements and lack of thorough understanding of GSM protocols in general. This scenario is changing significantly with the growing rate of development of open-source tools, which can serve to harness the RF signaling and enable processing on a general purpose workstation. In this paper, these open-source tools are utilized to study the feasibility of developing a GSM Protocol Analyzer and investigating the theoretical security protocols and procedures through practical implementation of such system. Universal Software Programmable Radio Peripheral (USRP) was selected as the RF frontend for the protocol analyzer. The USRP is a general purpose, open-hardware transceiver that can be linked to a workstation via an RJ45 Gigabit Ethernet link. Various open-source software, based primarily on GNU Radio, are then utilized to synchronize, demodulate and decode the received signal.", "This paper describe an implementation of audio processing in beagleboard.

The conceptualization comprises all stages in the design process, ranging from need-finding to the openness of the design documents and the data gathered during the design process, and the commercialization of the end-product. The aspects of the product and the process merge in this framework, intertwining the aspects of technical, legal and commercial openness. Finally, the article proposes a research agenda for open design.

(C) 2021 Optical Society of America", "The large increment expected in the diffusion of light-electric-vehicles will raise several issues that must be addressed to cope with this trend, including battery diagnostic and maintenance services. The battery system is the most expensive part in the majority of the e-mobility devices. Therefore, battery manufacturers tend to reduce the battery cost by using simple battery management systems that provide only basic safety features. Possible advanced functionalities are not implemented and the battery may lose performanceduring its use. Widely spread maintenance centers are thus required to support the mobility electrification process, but their diffusion is limited by the high cost ofprofessional battery characterization instruments. This work proposes an open-hardware low-cost battery maintenance tool architecture that can be used with common laboratory instruments. The tool is based on a relay-matrix and a battery monitor integrated circuit. It is able to completely characterize and optimize the state of a battery independently of the battery management system and also gives a figure of the individual aging of the battery cells. The work shows the architecture and the experimental validation of a 16-cells battery maintenance tool prototype. The results demonstrate that utilizing the tool brings the battery in the best possible state and identifies the degradation of the cells in terms of capacity and resistance.", "A great challenge among communities participating in germplasm repository development is to obtain suitable cryopreservation equipment and devices. Commercial programmable freezers are costly and thus unaffordable to many users. Self-made devices have substantial variability , resulting in few opportunities for standardization across communities. The development of open hardware with the increasing accessibility of three-dimensional (3-D) printing offers rapid prototyping and easy fabrication of devices by users around the world at low cost. The present study explored the feasibility of developing operational prototypes of 3-D printed motorized cryopreservation devices for continuous freezing of non-batched samples. A controlled cooling conveyor device (CCCD) was designed and fabricated to cryopreserve sperm samples in straws that were loaded onto chain links suspended over liquid nitrogen held in a Styrofoam box. Cooling rates of 5-34 degrees C/min for 0.5-mL French straws were produced by adjusting the height of conveyor chains, slopes, and liquid nitrogen mass. The plunge temperature (-47 degrees C to -61 degrees C) was controlled by adjustment of conveyor speed. The cooling curves from the CCCD were comparable to a commercial programmable freezer. There were no significant differences in post-thaw motility of sperm from ornamental (Koi) common carp (Cyprinus carpio) among samples frozen with the CCCD and those frozen with a commercial programmable freezer. The post-thaw sperm motility was consistent among samples frozen in the CCCD across a 15-min time span. The CCCD prototypes in the present study proved to be feasible and functional as low-cost, customizable, portable, and yet standardizable options for freezing of individual (non-batched) samples. Additional design alternatives are proposed to facilitate further adaptation and development by diverse user communities.", "Holographic methods from optics can be adapted to acoustics for enabling novel applications in particle manipulation or patterning by generating dynamic custom-tailored acoustic fields. Here, we present three contributions towards making the field of acoustic holography more widespread. Firstly, we introduce an iterative algorithm that accurately calculates the amplitudes and phases of an array of ultrasound emitters in order to create a target amplitude field in mid-air. Secondly, we use the algorithm to analyse the impact of spatial, amplitude and phase emission resolution on the resulting acoustic field, thus providing engineering insights towards array design. For example, we show an onset of diminishing returns for smaller than a quarter-wavelength sized emitters and a phase and amplitude resolution of eight and four divisions per period, respectively. Lastly, we present a hardware platform for the generation of acoustic holograms. The array is integrated in a single board composed of 256 emitters operating at 40 kHz. We hope that the results and procedures described within this paper enable researchers to build their own ultrasonic arrays and explore novel applications of ultrasonic holograms.", "Contribution: While research indicates usefulness of remote laboratories in teaching of digital hardware systems, their main application is to complement stationary classes. This work presents a low-cost, scalable architecture that supports rapid transformation of teaching to a model based solely on remote access mechanisms. Background: Adaptation of online laboratory solutions from the literature to en-masse teaching of digital circuits is time-consuming and expensive. Solutions that permit cheap and rapid conversion of courses to remote environments seem to be of high value, especially when social distancing renders direct teaching impossible. Intended Outcomes: Demonstration of a flexible and cheap architecture that permits rapid transformation of digital circuits laboratories to the remote environment. Validation of system's performance and usefulness on a large group of students. Application Design: Remote digital circuits laboratories from the literature are designed to complement stationary classes.

Findings: The proposed remote laboratory architecture enables rapid conversion of on-site teaching to online model, while supporting in-situupgrades and functionality enhancements. The presented solution proved to be a convenient substitute for conventional laboratories during pandemic.", "This article explores the multiple meanings of the concept of openness in the global maker movement. Openness is viewed as one of the key principles of the maker movement. As the global maker movement is a bricolage of diverse and situated practices and traditions, there are also many different interpretations and ways of practicing openness. We have explored this diversity with an integrative literature review, relying on the Web of Science (TM) database. We identified three interrelated but also, in part, mutually contested approaches to openness. Firstly, openness often refers to applying open hardware. Secondly, it is in many cases related to the inclusion and empowerment of various groups in making. Thirdly, openness appears to be seen as a means to pursue economic growth through increasing innovation activity and entrepreneurship. Our results also highlight the substantial barriers encountered by makers while aiming to open up their practices. These barriers include: value conflicts in which openness is overridden by other important values; exclusion of lower income groups from making due to a lack of resources; and difficulties in maintaining long-term activities. The different meanings of openness together with the barriers create tensions within the maker movement while implementing openness. We propose that engaging in a reflexive futures dialogue on the consequences of these tensions can enhance the maker movement to become more open, inclusive and resilient.", "The proliferation of versatile open software and hardware for microscopy is helping to democratize biological imaging for both current and aspiring scientists.", "This article presents the realization of a low-cost wearable sensor system and its Python-based software that can measure and record relative head-torso angle, especially in sagittal plane.

The Global Open Science Hardware (GOSH) movement gathers actors from a diversity of sectors advocating for OSH to be ubiquitous by 2025. This paper examines the GOSH movement's emergence and main features through the lens of transitions theory and the grassroots innovation movements framework. GOSH is here described embedded in the context of the wider open hardware movement and analyzed in terms of framings that inform it, spaces opened up for action and strategies developed to open them.

Proximity data acquisition usually depends on a hardware solution to which some sensors can be coupled, managed by a software that may (or may not) store, process and send acquired data to a back-end using some communication protocol. The sheer number of both proprietary and open hardware solutions, together with the diversity and characteristics of available sensors, is enough to deem the task of designing a data acquisition device complex. Factoring in the harsh operational context, the multiple DIY solutions presented by an active online community, available in-field power approaches and the different communication protocols, each proximity monitoring solution can be regarded as singular. Data acquisition devices should be increasingly flexible, not only by supporting a large number of heterogeneous sensors, but also by being able to resort to different communication protocols, depending on both the operational and functional contexts in which they are deployed. Furthermore, these small and unattended devices need to be sufficiently robust and cost-effective to allow greater in-field measurement granularity 365 days/year. This paper presents a low-cost, flexible and robust data acquisition device that can be deployed in different operational contexts, as it also supports three different communication technologies: IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee, LoRa/LoRaWAN and GRPS. Software and hardware features, suitable for using heat pulse methods to measure sap flow, leaf wetness sensors and others are embedded. Its power consumption is of only 83 mu A during sleep mode and the cost of the basic unit was kept below the EUR 100 limit.

However, massive data collection of root traits and the development of associated artificial intelligence approaches have been hampered by the inaccessibility of the rhizosphere. Here we present ChronoRoot, a system that combines 3D-printed open-hardware with deep segmentation networks for high temporal resolution phenotyping of plant roots in agarized medium. Results: We developed a novel deep learning-based root extraction method that leverages the latest advances in convolutional neural networks for image segmentation and incorporates temporal consistency into the root system architecture reconstruction process. Automatic extraction of phenotypic parameters from sequences of images allowed a comprehensive characterization of the root system growth dynamics. Furthermore, novel time-associated parameters emerged from the analysis of spectral features derived from temporal signals. Conclusions: Our work shows that the combination of machine intelligence methods and a 3D-printed device expands the possibilities of root high-throughput phenotyping for genetics and natural variation studies, as well as the screening of clock-related mutants, revealing novel root traits.", "Sensemaking involves turning circumstances into a situation that is comprehended explicitly in words and that serves as a springboard into action. In this paper we take the position that the concept of sensemaking fills important gaps in organizational theory. The seemingly transient nature of sensemaking belies its central role in the determination of human behavior, whether people are acting in formal organizations or elsewhere. Sensemaking is central because it is the primary site where meanings materialize that inform and constrain identity and action. The purpose of this paper is to take stock of the concept of sensemaking. We do so by pinpointing central features of sensemaking, some of which have been explicated but neglected, some of which have been assumed but not made explicit, some of which have changed in significance over time, and some of which have been missing all along or have gone awry. We sense joint enthusiasm to restate sensemaking in ways that make it more future oriented, more action oriented, more macro, more closely tied to organizing, meshed more boldly with identity, more visible, more behaviorally defined, less sedentary and backward looking, more infused with emotion and with issues of sensegiving and persuasion. These key enhancements provide a foundation upon which to build future studies that can strengthen the sensemaking perspective.", "A new open-hardware bioreactor capable of applying electrical field stimulation in conjunction with static or cyclic stretch is presented. Stretch is applied to cells by a specially designed elastomeric membrane with a central seeding region.

To prepare for the next pandemic, this study reviews the state-of-the-art of open hardware designs needed in a COVID-19-like pandemic. It evaluates the readiness of the top twenty technologies requested by the Government of India. The results show that the majority of the actual medical products have some open source development, however, only 15% of the supporting technologies required to produce them are freely available. The results show there is still considerable research needed to provide open source paths for the development of all the medical hardware needed during pandemics. Five core areas of future research are discussed, which include (i) technical development of a wide-range of open source solutions for all medical supplies and devices, (ii) policies that protect the productivity of laboratories, makerspaces, and fabrication facilities during a pandemic, as well as (iii) streamlining the regulatory process, (iv) developing Good-Samaritan laws to protect makers and designers of open medical hardware, as well as to compel those with knowledge that will save lives to share it, and (v) requiring all citizen-funded research to be released with free and open source licenses.", "Both the free and open source software (FOSS) as well as the distributed digital manufacturing of free and open source hardware (FOSH) has shown particular promise among scientists for developing custom scientific tools. Early research found substantial economic savings for these technologies, but as the open source design paradigm has grown by orders of magnitude it is possible that the savings observed in the early work was isolated to special cases. Today there are examples of open source technology for science in the vast majority of disciplines and several resources dedicated specifically to publishing them. Do the tremendous economic savings observed earlier hold today? To answer that question, this study evaluates free and open source technologies in the two repositories compared to proprietary functionally-equivalent tools as a function of their use of Arduino-based electronics, RepRap-class 3-D printing, as well as the combination of the two. The results of the review find overwhelming evidence for a wide range of scientific tools, that open source technologies provide economic savings of 87% compared to equivalent or lesser proprietary tools. These economic savings increased slightly to 89% for those that used Arduino technology and even more to 92% for those that used RepRap-class 3-D printing. Combining both Arduino and 3-D printing the savings averaged 94% for free and open source tools over commercial equivalents. The results provide strong evidence for financial support of open source hardware and software development for the sciences. Given the overwhelming economic advantages of free and open source technologies, it appears financially responsible to divert funding of proprietary scientific tools and their development in favor of FOSH. Policies were outlined that provide nations with a template for strategically harvesting the opportunities provided by the free and open source paradigm. (C) 2020 The Author.

Drifters that can be tracked in real time have so far been rather expensive. Recently, due to the rise of the open-hardware revolution and the associated Arduino ecosystem, both GPS receivers and cellular modems have become available at lower prices to \"tinkering scientists\", i.e., scientists that like to build their own measurement devices as much as is possible. This article serves two goals. Firstly, we provide detailed instructions on how to build a low-power GPS drifter with local storage and cellular model that we tested in a fieldwork on the confluence of the Chindwin and Ayeyarwady rivers in Myanmar. The device was designed from easily connected off-the-shelf components, allowing construction without a background in electrical engineering. The instructions allow fellow geoscientists to recreate the device. Secondly, we set the following question: has the open-hardware revolution progressed to the point that a low-power GPS drifter that wirelessly transmits its position can be made from open-hardware components by most geoscientists?. We feel this question is relevant and timely as more low-cost open-hardware devices are promoted, but in practice applicability is often restricted to the \"tinkering engineer\". We argue that because of the plug-and-play nature of the components geoscientists should be able to construct these type of devices.

IP has been the de facto standard for seamless interconnectivity in the traditional Internet; and piggybacking on the success of IP, 6LoWPAN has been the first standardized technology to realize it for networks of resource-constrained devices.

We believe that the knowledge and insights will facilitate IoT innovations based on this promising technology. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The AC power meter, provided as open hardware, is designed using the same micro controller as the Arduino UNO1 with an In-system Programming (ISP) interface, thus allowing the user to change the firmware to match their particular use case using Arduino libraries or standard C language. The suggested design is compatible with the Raspberry Pi 3(2), making it a suitable real-time measurement accessory for the single board computer. The platform features an 8 channel simultaneous sampling Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) which allows a high fidelity sampling without time offsets. Depending on how the user decides to combine current transformers (CTs) and AC-AC voltage adapters for the input channels, circuit breakers or appliances can be measured in either one phase or three phases.", "Impedance cardiography (ICG) is a noninvasive method for monitoring cardiac dynamics using electrical bioimpedance (EBI) measurements. Since its appearance more than 40 years ago, ICG has been used for assessing hemodynamic parameters. This paper presents a measurement system based on two System on Chip (SoC) solutions and Raspberry PI, implementing both a full three-lead ECG recorder and an impedance cardiographer, for educational and research development purposes. Raspberry PI is a platform supporting Do-I t-Yourself project and education applications across the world. The development is part of Biosignal PI, an open hardware platform focusing in quick prototyping of physiological measurement instrumentation. The SoC used for sensing cardiac biopotential is the ADAS1000, and for the EBI measurement is the AD5933. The recordings were wirelessly transmitted through Bluetooth to a PC, where the waveforms were displayed, and hemodynamic parameters such as heart rate, stroke volume, ejection time and cardiac output were extracted from the ICG and ECG recordings. These results show how Raspberry PI can be used for quick prototyping using relatively widely available and affordable components, for supporting developers in research and engineering education. The design and development documents will be available on www.BiosignalPl.com, for open access under a Non Commercial-Share A like 4.0 International License.", "An Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) reader accompanying a sample changer unit for multi sample measurements was designed and constructed so that consecutive automated luminescence measurements can be performed. The reader was realized using open source software and hardware to minimize the development costs. The core control system of the reader is an open source single-board microcontroller (Arduino DUE). The control of sample positioning mechanism, stimulation system, precise timing and photon counting are accomplished using entirely this board. A user friendly measurement control software was written in an open-source programming language (Python) so that it can be run on any platform. The stimulation system utilizes a high power light emitting diode in the visible region and was designed to enable the commonly used stimulation modes known as continuous wave and linearly modulated OSL. The system went through operation testing with materials commonly used for dosimetry and dating studies and showed that it is precise for luminescence measurement. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Among all pollutants, fine particulate matters (PM2.5) directly related to various serious health concerns, e.g., lung cancer, premature death, asthma, and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. To enhance the quality of urban living, sensors are deployed to create smart cities. In this paper, we present a participatory urban sensing framework for PM2.5 monitoring with more than 2500 devices deployed in Taiwan and 29 other countries. It is one of the largest deployment project for PM2.5 monitor in the world as we know until May 2017. The key feature of the framework is its open system architecture, which is based on the principles of open hardware, open source software, and open data. To facilitate the deployment of the framework, we investigate the accuracy issue of low-cost particle sensors with a comprehensive set of comparison evaluations to identify the most reliable sensor. By working closely with government authorities, industry partners, and maker communities, we can construct an effective eco-system for participatory urban sensing of PM2.5 particles. Based on our deployment achievements to date, we provide a number of data services to improve environmental awareness, trigger on-demand responses, and assist future government policymaking. The proposed framework is highly scalable and sustainable with the potential to facilitate the Internet of Things, smart cities, and citizen science in the future.", "In this article we present the Intelligent Industrial Internet (I3) Mote, an open hardware platform targeting industrial connectivity and sensing deployments.

Maker Education is based on knowledge, directed by creation, and is aimed at solving problems. This study, aimed at the curriculum of the Department of Information Management, expects to develop a systematic information Maker curriculum. This curriculum, combined with the 3D printing machine and Arduino open hardware configured with the STEM education framework, is designed to explore the impact of the introduction of Maker education to information curriculum of technical or vocational colleges on attitude differences and learning of STEM. Two courses, 3D model design and Arduino programming, are implemented, after the end of which, students' achievements are evaluated. The result is that male still have higher interests in science, engineering and technology than women, but Maker curriculum is multifaceted and foundational so that many people can spend a little time in learning and use various skills to produce their own works. Therefore, there is little difference between women and men in scores of achievement test.", "Distributed embedded sensor and actuator platforms will be at the core of any research initiatives on smart objects. In this context, recent developments in wireless sensing and micro-sensor technologies provide foundation platforms for considering the development of effective modular systems. They offer the prospect, currently at a prototyping level, of flexibility in use and network scalability. Wireless sensor devices are the hardware building blocks required to construct the core elements of wireless sensor networks. A number of large scale research programmes have developed over the last few years to explore these emerging technologies. We review some of the largest of these, including a review of the current wireless sensor integration technologies. This chapter will also look more closely at some of the more well-known wireless motes that are being used as toolkits for research, development and field trials.", "Although analysis in IR and IPE has increasingly started to focus on non-state actors and the information society, the role of the legal architecture of the Internet has been relatively under-analysed in terms of the structural power around communication interfaces. In this article I suggest the work of Lewis Mumford offers a useful tens for thinking about the political economy of technological change in an information society. I set out the role of intellectual property rights as the legal form of the global information society, and suggest a major challenge to this legal form is the idea of 'openness', specifically in the realm of open-source and/or free software. I examine this issue in the realm of (so-called) informational development, where major proprietary players (predominantly Microsoft) have been confronted by an increasingly vibrant open-source alternative. The open-source and free-software movements can be analysed as an emerging example of a globalised 'double movement', seeking to re-embed the tools of informational development in a societal realm of information, establishing in Mumford's terms a 'democratic technics' as a reaction to the programme of information and knowledge commodification spurred by the TRIPs agreement.", "Large LAr TPCs are among the most powerful detectors to address open problems in particle and astro-particle physics, such as CP violation in leptonic sector, neutrino properties and their astrophysical implications, proton decay search etc. The scale of such detector implies severe constraints on their readout and DAQ system. In this article we describe a data acquisition scheme for this new generation of large detectors. The main challenge is to propose a scalable and easy to use solution able to manage a large number of channels at the lowest cost. It is interesting to note that these constraints are very similar to those existing in Network Telecommunication Industry. We propose to study how emerging technologies like ATCA and mu TCA could he used in neutrino experiments. We describe the design of an Advanced Mezzanine Board (AMC) including 32 ADC channels. This board receives 32 analogical channels at the front panel and sends the formatted data through the mu TCA backplane using a Gigabit Ethernet link. The gigabit switch of the MCH is used to centralize and to send the data to the event building computer. The core of this card is a FPGA (ARIA-GX from ALTERA) including the whole system except the memories. A hardware accelerator has been implemented using a NIOS II mu P and a Gigabit MAC IP. Obviously, in order to be able to reconstruct the tracks from the events a time synchronisation system is mandatory. We decided to implement the IEEE1588 standard also called Precision Timing Protocol, another emerging and promising technology in Telecommunication Industry. In this article we describe a Gigabit PTP implementation using the recovered clock of the gigabit link. By doing so the drift is directly cancelled and the Pip will be used only to evaluate and to correct the offset.", "The \"iCub\" is a robotic platform that was developed within the RobotCub European project to provide the cognition research community with an open \"child-like\" humanoid platform for understanding and development of cognitive systems [1].

The new lower body assembly demonstrates significant improvements over the old prototype including higher modularity, full joint state sensing and improved range of motion and torque capabilities. In particular the new leg and waist mechanisms to match the size and physical abilities of a 3 1/2 year old human child are introduced.", "Mechanical load and chemical factors as stimuli for the different pattern of the extracellular matrix (ECM) could be responsible for cardiac dysfunction. Since fibroblasts can both synthesize and degrade ECM, ventricular fibroblasts from adult rat hearts underwent cyclical mechanical stretch (CMS; 0.33 Hz) by three different elongations ( 3%,6%, 9%) and four different serum concentrations (0%, 0.5%, 5%, 10%) within 24 h. Expression of collagen I and III, as well as matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP- 2), tissue inhibitor of MMP- 2 (TIMP-2), and colligin were analyzed by RNase protection assay. In the absence of serum, 9% CMS increased the mRNA of collagen I by 1.70- fold and collagen III by 1.64-fold. This increase was prevented by the inhibition either of PKC or of tyrosine kinase but not of PKA. Inhibition of PKC or tyrosine kinase itself reduced the expression of collagen I and collagen III mRNA. The mRNA of MMP- 2, TIMP-2, and colligin showed the same tendency by stretch. Combined with 10% serum, 6% CMS reduced the mRNA of collagen I (0.62-fold) and collagen III ( 0.79fold). Inhibition of PKC or tyrosine kinase, but not of PKA, prevented the reduction of collagen I and collagen III mRNA in 10% serum. The results show that the response of fibroblasts to CMS depends on the serum concentration. At least two signaling pathways are involved in the stretch-induced ECM regulation. Myocardial fibrosis due to ECM remodeling contributes to the dysfunction of the failing heart, which might be attributed to changes in hemodynamic loading.", "Open source software lets users study, modify and redistribute the source code.

Technical aspects of the mesh-phone implementation, such as design constraints and implementation details, are addressed. The technical feasibility is validated by describing the implementation of a prototype of the mesh-enabled phone over the Openmoko (TM) open platform. Besides technical feasibility also convenience of the addressed solution is analyzed in terms of the consumed power, and some \"energy-saving\" related enhancements are suggested to be applied to future user's devices.

However, as most of the proposed approaches are suitable for outdoor operation, only a few techniques have been designed for indoor environments, where the systems cannot rely on the Global Positioning System (GPS) and, therefore, have to use their exteroceptive sensors for navigation. In this paper, we present a general navigation system that enables a small-sized quadrotor system to autonomously operate in indoor environments.

In this paper, we analyse the practical experiences from an implementation of citizen sensing for urban environment monitoring. A bottom-up model in which citizens develop and use sensors for environmental monitoring is described and assessed. The paper focuses on a case study of Amsterdam Smart Citizens Lab using NO2 sensors for air quality monitoring.

The appearance of new urban places for technological innovation is reviving the ageing industrial processes of this manufacturing city. It is supposed to transform Shenzhen into the Silicon Valley of hardware. Two groups, one local, the shanzhai community made up of entrepreneurs and companies historically based on a strategy of imitating highend products, and the other, a more international maker community, are thought to be the main drivers of this change using values of 'open innovation'. The building of this ecosystem relies largely on practices associated with being open-source. Like in California, open innovation contributed to the creation of resources for the development of a vast high-tech industry. This ethnographic field study shows how, while both communities, the international makers and the shanzhai, draw on open innovation, they do not have the same values. For the shanzhai, open innovation means total deregulation and a kind of coopetition that poorly masks fierce competition. For the makers, open innovation does not entirely eliminate the classic tension between 'open' and 'closed' commons in the world of makers. These two communities still rarely collaborate.", "In this era of wireless engineering, Open source application has turned out to be an evolving concept in the development of GSM technology.

Even though on the one hand such a multitude of technologies has enabled a wide range of applications, on the other hand, it has produced a growing heterogeneity in the IoT scenario. By considering the high-level IoT architecture, such heterogeneity can be overcome by using IoT gateways providing modularity, flexibility and scalability features. In the paper the role of an IoT gateway in the IoT architecture is first described, as well as main wireless communication standards adopted to connect IoT objects, then the AMBER board is presented as an advanced solution able to cope with network heterogeneity in the IoT scenario while providing all above reported features. Thanks to its design concept based on the support of Extender modules and System-on-Modules, AMBER is able to host multiple IoT wireless subsystems developed by a large number of vendors, as well as to increase over the time its computational capabilities, thus being able to accomplish more and more demanding tasks assigned to IoT gateways.", ["Dynamic development of information and communication technologies nowadays lead to arising the new solutions in monitoring and sensing applications.

The drive towards smart cities has produced the need for smart sensors to be able to monitor what is happening in our cities. This, combined with the decrease in hardware component prices and the increase in the popularity of open hardware, has favored the deployment of sensor networks based on open hardware. The new trends in Internet Protocol (IP) communication between sensor nodes allow sensor access via the Internet, turning them into smart objects (Internet of Things and Web of Things). Currently, WSNs provide data in different formats. There is a lack of communication protocol standardization, which turns into interoperability issues when connecting different sensor networks or even when connecting different sensor nodes within the same network. This work presents a sensorized platform proposal that adheres to the principles of the Internet of Things and the Web of Things. Wireless sensor nodes were built using open hardware solutions, and communications rely on the HTTP/IP Internet protocols.

At the thing' leveldevices and inter-device network communicationthe core technical building blocks are generally the same as those found in wireless sensor network implementations. For the Internet of Things to continue growing, we need more plentiful resources for building intelligent devices and sensor networks. Unfortunately, current commercial devices, e.g., sensor nodes and network gateways, tend to be expensive and proprietary, which presents a barrier to entry and arguably slows down further development. There are, however, an increasing number of open embedded platforms available and also a wide selection of off-the-shelf components that can quickly and easily be built into device and network gateway solutions. The question is whether these solutions measure up to built-for-purpose devices. In the paper, we provide a comparison of existing built-for-purpose devices against open source devices. For comparison, we have also designed and rapidly prototyped a sensor node based on off-the-shelf components. We show that these devices compare favorably to built-for-purpose devices in terms of performance, power and cost. Using open platforms and off-the-shelf components would allow more developers to build intelligent devices and sensor networks, which could result in a better overall development ecosystem, lower barriers to entry and rapid growth in the number of IoT applications.", null, "We describe a flexible, simple to build, low-cost, and computer-controlled optical mirror actuator system, developed for undergraduate research laboratories.

Smartphones is an example of an open-platform product, and the Apps that are designed to run on smartphones are examples for modules. Each customer downloads certain Apps that fit his/her needs, thereby creating an individual smartphone. The Apps, however, are software modules. The modules that are considered in this paper are hardware modules. Open-platform products will create a new paradigm in product design and utilization that we call the Mass-Individualization paradigm. The Mass-Individualization paradigm will boost the economy by (1) creating many new jobs in module production companies and (2) increasing the level of sales of consumer products.

This paper deals with the automatic configuration of IoT devices in a secure way through the Cloud, in order to provide new added-value services. After a discussion on the limits of current IoT and Cloud solutions in terms of secure self-configuration, we present a Cloud-based architecture that allows IoT devices to interact with several federated Cloud providers. In particular, we present two possible scenarios, that is, single Cloud and a federated Cloud environments, interacting with IoT devices and we address specific issues of both. Moreover, we present several design highlights on how to operate considering real open hardware and software products already available in the market.", "Electronic systems are not widely used for measuring biological variables in beehives despite the importance that honeybees have for both the environment and humans. A better understanding of bee colonies is needed in order to prevent certain dangers that threaten the bee population. In this study, we have developed an electronic system based on the Arduino Open Hardware platform, to which we have added temperature and humidity sensors to adapt the system to the particular conditions of beehive management. The system has been used to record changes in temperature and humidity inside hives and assess bees' thermoregulation adaptability within colonies in hives with opened-screened bottom boards; an interesting management tool for controlling the harmful Varroa destructor mite as compared to beehives with conventional closed bottom boards. The results revealed that bee colonies were able to thermoregulate in hives with open anti-Varroa bottom boards to the same degree as those in conventional bottom board hives even under winter conditions in a mediterranean climate, thus indicating that there are no additional risks associated with the use of open-screened bottom board models.

The proposed design extends an existing open-source and open-hardware quadrotor project, i. e., the Crazyflie nano quadrotor, by adding the guidance, navigation and control layers required to accomplish autonomous flight. The control layer, in particular, is based on a cascade control algorithm able to globally stabilize the position and the attitude of the vehicle. The global property guaranteed by the algorithm allows the quadrotors to perform aggressive maneuvers. The guidance layer is designed to coordinate simultaneously multiple vehicles by generating suitable reference trajectories. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design.", "One often-overlooked factor when selecting a platform for large-scale electrophysiology is whether or not a particular data acquisition system is 'open' or 'closed': that is, whether or not the system's schematics and source code are available to end users. Open systems have a reputation for being difficult to acquire, poorly documented, and hard to maintain. With the arrival of more powerful and compact integrated circuits, rapid prototyping services, and web-based tools for collaborative development, these stereotypes must be reconsidered. We discuss some of the reasons why multichannel extracellular electrophysiology could benefit from open-source approaches and describe examples of successful community-driven tool development within this field. In order to promote the adoption of open-source hardware and to reduce the need for redundant development efforts, we advocate a move toward standardized interfaces that connect each element of the data processing pipeline. This will give researchers the flexibility to modify their tools when necessary, while allowing them to continue to benefit from the high-quality products and expertise provided by commercial vendors.", null, "Sustainability has become a major concern in many countries and is leading to strict regulations regarding the impact of products and services during their manufacturing, use, and disposal. Power consumption monitoring in manufacturing companies can lead to a reduction of machine tools energy wastes and consequently to lower expenses. To this end, a complete transparency of energy usage among the entire manufacturing facilities is required. Despite the small volume of material processed, micro manufacturing processes are energy intensive and the optimization of energy usage becomes critical for manufacturing sustainability. Electrical discharge machining (EDM) is considered an attractive solution for the manufacturing of microcomponents. In this paper, a low cost and modular data acquisition system, based on open-hardware and open-source software, for online energy consumption monitoring, is presented. The system described is applied for energy efficiency analysis of the micro EDM milling process by using a state of the art commercial machine tool. A number of sensors is connected to the data acquisition system to measure the energy consumption of the main sub-systems of the machine tool, data is recorded through a microcontroller, and sent to the main computer via Wi-Fi for data storage and analysis. Results show that the process efficiency depends on machine parameters but it is always far below 0.01 %. Solutions are suggested to improve the energy efficiency of the machine tool considered in this work.", "This paper presents a design for a low-cost research robot based on the chassis of a Hexbug Spider, a remote controlled toy robot.

The hexapod locomotion makes the robot attractive for applications where a two wheel differential drive cannot be used. Our modification is published as open hardware and open source to allow further customizations.", "We present an activity framed within the European Robotics Week event. Robotics and computational practice are ideal tools for developing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) pedagogy. A modular and adaptive hands-on workshop is described in detail. The workshop is based on multiplatform educational robotics content as a first step into the robotics world. Three educational tools are used to introduce examples of robotics applications. The operational details, materials, and examples of activities for selected modules are presented with the expectation that all teachers can adapt these activities to their classes. Despite the small number of students, the experience delivered results that might be useful for other instructors to promote workshops with similar or identical content to generate further benefits. This study demonstrates that it is important to combine theory and practice and include fun tasks that intertwine the challenges of applying theory to problem solving. Furthermore, the results show how the same content can be deployed using three different robotics education tools.", "Supported by easier and cheaper access to tools and expanding communities, maker cultures are pointing towards the ideas of (almost) everyone designing, creating, producing and distributing renewed, new and improved products, machines, things or artefacts. A careful analysis of the assumptions and challenges of maker cultures emphasizes the relevance of what may be called technological action, that is, active and critical interventions regarding the purposes and applications of technologies within ordinary lives, thus countering the deterministic trends of current directions of technology. In such transformative potential, we will explore a set of elements what is and could be technological action through snapshots of maker cultures based on the empirical research conducted in three particular contexts: the Fab Lab Network, Maker Media core outputs and initiatives such as Maker Faires, and the Open Source Hardware Association (OSHWA). Elements such as control and empowerment through material engagement, openness and sharing, and social, cultural, political and ethical values of the common good in topics such as diversity, sustainability and transparency, are critically analysed.", "Major cloud service providers, including Amazon and Microsoft, have started employing field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to build high-performance and low-power-consumption cloud capability. However, utilizing an FPGA-enabled cloud is still challenging because of two main reasons. First, the introduction of software and hardware co-design leads to high development complexity. Second, FPGA virtualization and accelerator scheduling techniques are not fully researched for cluster deployment. In this paper, we propose an open-source FPGA-as-a-service (FaaS) platform, the hCODE, to simplify the design, management and deployment of FPGA accelerators at cluster scale. The proposed platform implements a Shell-and-IP design pattern and an open accelerator repository to reduce design and management costs of FPGA projects. Efficient FPGA virtualization and accelerator scheduling techniques are proposed to deploy accelerators on the FPGA-enabled cluster easily. With the proposed hCODE, hardware designers and accelerator users can be organized on one platform to efficiently build open-hardware ecosystem.", "Slot die coating is growing in popularity because it is a low operational cost and easily scaled processing technique for depositing thin and uniform films rapidly, while minimizing material waste. The complex inner geometry of conventional slot dies require expensive machining that limits accessibility and experimentation. In order to overcome these issues this study follows an open hardware approach, which uses an open source 3-D printer to both fabricate the slot die and then to functionalize a 3-D slot die printing system. Polymer materials are tested and selected for compatibility with common solvents and used to fabricate a custom slot die head. This slot die is then integrated into a 3-D printer augmented with a syringe pump to form an additive manufacturing platform for thin film semiconductor devices. The full design of the slot die system is disclosed here using an open source license including software and operational protocols. This study demonstrates that functional lab-grade slot dies may be 3-D printed using low-cost open source hardware methods A case study using NiO2 found an RMS value 0.486 nm, thickness of 17-49 nm, and a maximum optical transmission of 99.1%, which shows this additive manufacturing approach to slot die depositions as well of fabrication is capable of producing viable layers of advanced electronic materials. Using this method, a cost savings of over 17,000% was obtained when compared to commercial slot die systems for laboratories. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The first and main reason for introducing the revenue registry was the lack of instruments of the Tax Administration to fight tax evasions. The second reason was the elimination of unfair competition based on gain of undue advantage by not paying the value added tax (VAT) and the income tax. The system of the revenue registry in the Czech Republic is founded on several principles that distinguish it from other systems based on a cash register or other systems of electronic evidence. The revenue registry is based on the principles of electronisation, on-line access of tax administrator to information, the possibility of voluntary public involvement into oversight and open hardware and software solution. Unfortunately, shortly after the adoption by the Parliament, the group of legislators started a case at the Constitutional Court, demanding the abolition of the Revenue Registry Act or at least some parts of the Act because of its unconstitutionality. They were partially successful and now the Ministry of Finance has been tasked with the preparation of an amendment to the Act. The goal of this contribution is to briefly introduce and describe the Revenue Registry Act, critically analyse the fundamental provisions of the Act, summarize pros and cons of the regulation, critically analyse the decision of the Constitutional Court and introduce the Ministry's proposal of amendments. The hypothesis that the electronic revenue registry is an effective tool for fair tax payments was neither confirmed nor disproved: The electronic revenue registry might be an effective tool for fair tax payments, but only in case of unified rules for all businessmen. The higher the number of exemptions is, the less effective tool the revenue registry is.", "The massive development take place in the field of IoT (Internet of Things) has enabled generation of large set of real time environmental data from low cost sensor networks. This has enabled developing nations to monitor their environments with more economical options. The environmental monitoring network of Sri Lanka is mainly handled by the government bodies such as Meteorological Department, Irrigation Department and Central Environmental Authority. Most of the systems are manually operated and sparsely distributed. The automated systems are restricted to certain main cities of the country. Thus, the data provided by the existing network not capable enough to generate reliable climate or disaster specific forecasts. The available data is mostly retained as hard copies and they are not freely and publicly available. Hence, every time, the researchers and decision makers need to purchase data and required to undergo redundant data collection procedures. In this context, the 4ONSE research project on developing an experimental, open-source, low cost and non-conventional Environmental Monitoring System (EMS) can be considered as the 1st initiative in Sri Lanka which creates a new revolution in the country for environmental data viewing and sharing without any charge. 4ONSE is the acronym for 4 times Open and Non-Conventional technology for Sensing the Environment, which is a joint research between University of Moratuwa and University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland (SUPSI). Deduru Oya river basin area is the selected study area to deploy the 4ONSE systems. The Deduru Oya is 115km long and covers 2687km2 of catchment area. It carries flash floods during rainy seasons and very low flow during the dry seasons. Hence, the selected case study area is ideal for developing any forecasting application based on the real time environmental data. The project team has already deployed 27 systems in the basin. Temperature, rainfall, atmospheric pressure, solar radiation, relative humidity, soil moisture, wind speed and direction are the parameters measured by the system. In this research we attempt to present the state of the art of open source based environmental monitoring, architecture of the 4ONSE system, motivations behind deployment of the 4ONSE system and finally the lessons for the future research and development.", ["We present an open hardware and software platform to efficiently fuse heterogeneous sensor data in an automotive/robotic context.

This work implements a low-cost teleoperated system to control a humanoid robot, as a first step for further development and study of human motion and walking. A human suit is built, consisting of 8 sensors, 6 resistive linear potentiometers on the lower extremities and 2 digital accelerometers for the arms. The goal is to replicate the suit movements in a small humanoid robot. The data from the sensors is wirelessly transmitted via two ZigBee RF configurable modules installed on each device: the robot and the suit. Replicating the suit movements requires a robot stability control module to prevent falling down while executing different actions involving knees flexion. This is carried out via a feedback control system with an accelerometer placed on the robot's back. The measurement from this sensor is filtered using Kalman. In addition, a two input fuzzy algorithm controlling five servo motors regulates the robot balance. The humanoid robot is controlled by a medium capacity processor and a low computational cost is achieved for executing the different algorithms. Both hardware and software of the system are based on open platforms. The successful experiments carried out validate the implementation of the proposed teleoperated system.", "Smart wireless sensors have been recognized as a promising technology to overcome many inherent difficulties and limitations associated with traditional wired structural health monitoring (SHM) systems. Despite the advances in smart sensor technologies, on-board computing capability of smart sensors has been considered as one of the most difficult challenges in the application of the smart sensors in SHM. Taking the advantage of recent developments in microprocessor which provides powerful on-board computing functionality for smart sensors, this paper presents a new decentralized data processing approach for modal identification using the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) algorithm, which is based on signal decomposition technique. It is shown that this method is suitable for implementation in the intrinsically distributed computing environment found in wireless smart sensor networks (WSSNs). The HHT-based decentralized data processing is, then, programmed and implemented on the Crossbow IRIS mote sensor platform. The effectiveness of the proposed techniques is demonstrated through a set of numerical studies and experimental validations on an in-house cable-stayed bridge model in terms of the accuracy of identified dynamic properties.", "In spite of the availability of ultra-low-power microcontrollers and radio transceivers, the power consumption of an active sensor node is much higher than the power provided by state-of-the-art harvesters of suitable size and cost. Hence, the feasibility of energy-neutral wireless sensor networks mainly depends on the capability of the nodes to exploit idle periods to recover the energy spent to perform the tasks assigned to them. This paper discusses the main issues which prevent WSNs to fully exploit the idleness and presents a general power state model capturing the energy efficiency of a mote.

However, existing WSN-based monitoring systems are not adequate for monitoring pond and lake water, city water distribution and water reservoir. Moreover, these frameworks cannot be reused in other monitoring applications since they use static and application specific sensor nodes and are not dynamic to the changing requirements. Thus, we introduce a reusable, self-configurable, and energy efficient WSN-based water quality monitoring system that integrates a Web-based information portal and a sleep scheduling mechanism of sensor nodes. The testbed and simulation results show that the framework can monitor the water quality in real-time and the sleep scheduling mechanism increases the network lifetime, respectively.", ["Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe how 3D printing and scanning technology was implemented by the Dalhousie University Libraries in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

Second, the Commons-oriented wind turbine examined here is also meant to practically contribute to the quest for novel solutions to the timely problem of the need for (autonomous) renewable sources of energy, more in the sense of a development process than as a ready-to-apply solution. We demonstrate that it is possible for someone with partial initial knowledge to initiate a similar, complex project based on an interesting idea, and to succeed in implementing it through collaboration with Commons-oriented communities, while using peer-produced products and tools.

This position emerges from the authors' respective engagements in ethnographic research and design engagements with a slum community center in Bangkok, Thailand, and with makers and entrepreneurs in Shanghai and Shenzhen, China. In both cases, we found design to be a site of engagement with and interpretation of wider connections between different locales, and between local and global networks. We identify four crucial aspects of design for the purposes of this discussion: It is normative, concerned with function and the attainment of goals; it is practical, and oriented toward constraints and opportunities; it frames and defines problems concurrently with solving them; and it takes a systems approach that accounts for the broad context of the design situation. Approaching and participating in these aspects of design evolved in concert with our ethnographic fieldwork and analysis, allowing us to take design seriously without sacrificing an ethnographic commitment to nuanced description.

Poor bone quality, radiation, and diffuse osseous tumor involvement present significant challenges to spinal stabilization with instrumentation and occasionally result in postinstrumentation compression fractures. Vertebral cement augmentation has been effective in the treatment of painful tumor-related compression fractures.

The median time between instrumented surgery and vertebral augmentation was 5 months (1-48 months) and the median follow-up after cement augmentation was 24 months (4-59 months). A total of 22 vertebrae that were either within or immediately adjacent to the surgical instrumentation underwent vertebral augmentation. All patients reported a decrease in their pain scores (mean decrease: 6 Visual Analog Scale points; P < .003). One patient required reoperation after cement augmentation. None of the patients experienced vertebral cement augmentation-related complications.", "CONCLUSIONS: Vertebral cement augmentation represents a safe and effective treatment option in patients with recurrent or progressive back pain and instrumentation-associated vertebral compression fractures."], "Robotic swarms that take inspiration from nature are becoming a fascinating topic for multi-robot researchers. The aim is to control a large number of simple robots in order to solve common complex tasks. Due to the hardware complexities and cost of robot platforms, current research in swarm robotics is mostly performed by simulation software. The simulation of large numbers of these robots in robotic swarm applications is extremely complex and often inaccurate due to the poor modelling of external conditions.

Over mm-wave carriers, we report an ADEV of 7.1 x 10(-12) at 1 s and a TDEV of <10 ps at 10 000 s. Our results show that after 4 s of averaging, we have sufficient precision to transfer a cesium atomic frequency standard. We analyze the link budget and architecture of our mm-wave link and discuss possible sources of phase error and their potential impact on the WR frequency transfer.

An important reason behind the quick adoption has been the availability of open hardware alternatives. In this work, we present a robust and compact version of a light-sheet fluorescence microscope that is easy to assemble and requires little to no maintenance.

For SCP, massive data generated by users drives its design innovation and somehow determines its final success. Nevertheless, most existing works only look at the new functionalities or values that are derived in the one-way communication by introducing novel data analytics methods. Few work discusses about an effective and systematic approach to enable individual user innovation in such context, i.e. co-development process, which sets the fundamental basis of the prevailing concept of data-driven design. Aiming to fill this gap, this paper proposes a generic data-driven cyber-physical approach for personalised SCP co-development in a cloud-based environment. A novel concept of smart, connected, open architecture product is hence introduced with a generic cyber-physical model established in a cloud-based environment, of which the interaction processes are enabled by co-development toolkits with smartness and connectedness. Both the personalized SCP modelling method and the establishment of its cyber-physical product model are described in details. To further demonstrate the proposed approach, a case study of a smart wearable device (i.e. i-BRE respiratory mask) development process is given with general discussions.", "Rainfall is an important natural phenomenon for agricultural activities to fulfill its water requirements. The proposed irrigation technique in agriculture saves water by making it as an automated one. By detecting the rain fall in real time, the amount of water needed for the field can be planned. A system is developed based on ARM micro controller combined with GSM module to inform the rain fall level to the farmer and as well as automatically regulates the water irrigation. The system can monitor the current state of the land and data is transmitted to the mobile. The results obtained from the prototype are compared with the actual data taken from the web and it is found that the difference in estimation is minimum. The results from the prototype are compared with the traditional systems and it is found that the automation reveals best results in terms of water utilization. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

However, this area is less explored than other areas such as computer graphics and audio. Most advanced olfactory displays are designed for a specific experiment, they are hard to modify and extend, expensive, and/or can deliver a very limited number of scents. Additionally, current-generation olfactory displays make no decisions on if and when a scent should be released. This paper proposes a low-cost, easy to build, powerful smart olfactory display, that can release up to 24 different aromas and allow control of the quantity of the released aroma. The display is capable of absorbing back the aroma, in an attempt to clean the air prior to releasing a new aroma. Additionally, the display includes a smart algorithm that will decide when to release certain aromas. The device controller application includes releasing scents based on a timer, text in English subtitles, or input from external software applications. This allows certain applications (such as games) to decide when to release a scent, making it ideal for gaming. The device also supports native connectivity with games developed using a game development asset, developed as part of this project. The project was evaluated by 15 subjects and it was proved to have high accuracy when the scents were released with 1.5 minutes' delay from each other.", "Isaac Newton famously observed that \"if I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.\" We propose that this sentiment is a powerful motivation for the \"open-source\" movement in scientific research, in which creators provide everything needed to replicate a given project online, as well as providing explicit permission for users to use, improve, and share it with others.

Many platforms have been designed based on different charging technologies for a wide range of scenarios, including structural monitoring, habitat monitoring, wearable devices, volcano monitoring, and so on. However, these existing platforms cannot be deployed quickly and flexibly in many harsh environments, resulting in high deployment cost.

The multi-fluorescence imaging system consists of readily available 470 nm LEDs, a Raspberry Pi camera and a set of filters made with low cost acrylics. This device allows imaging in scales ranging from single colonies to entire plates. We developed a set of genetic components (e.g. promoters, coding sequences, terminators) and vectors following the standard framework of Golden Gate, which allowed the fabrication of genetic constructs in a combinatorial, low cost and robust manner. In order to provide simultaneous imaging of multiple wavelength signals, we screened a series of long stokes shift fluorescent proteins that could be combined with cyan/green fluorescent proteins. We found CyOFP1, mBeRFP and sfGFP to be the most compatible set for 3-channel fluorescent imaging. We developed open source Python code to operate the hardware to run time-lapse experiments with automated control of illumination and camera and a Python module to analyze data and extract meaningful biological information. To demonstrate the potential application of this integral system, we tested its performance on a diverse range of imaging assays often used in disciplines such as microbial ecology, microbiology and synthetic biology. We also assessed its potential use in a high school environment to teach biology, hardware design, optics, and programming.

Unfortunately, developing new batteryless applications is challenging. Energy resources are scarce and highly variable, power failures are frequent, and successful applications typically require custom hardware and special expertise.

Flicker is an extensible, modular, \"plug and play\" architecture that supports RFID, solar, and kinetic energy harvesting; passive and active wireless communication; and a wide range of sensors through common peripheral and harvester interconnects. Flicker supports recent advances in failure-tolerant timekeeping, testing, and debugging, while providing dynamic federated energy storage where peripheral priorities and user tasks can be adjusted without hardware changes. Flicker's software tools automatically detect new hardware configurations, and simplify software changes.

We also evaluated the usability of Flicker in a user study with 19 participants, and found it had above average or excellent usability according to the well known System Usability Survey.", "We are surrounded by increasingly complex networks of smart objects, yet our understanding and attachment to them is rather limited. One way to support stronger end users' engagement with such complex technologies is by involving them in the design process and, with the advent of Arduino prototyping platform, even in their making. While DIY practice offers the potential for stronger user engagement with physical artifacts, we know little about end users' DIY practice of making complex electronic technologies and their potential to ensure engagement with such devices. In this article, we report on interviews with 18 participants from two green communities who built and used an open source DIY energy monitor, with the aim to explore the end users DIY practices of making such complex electronic devices. Findings indicate four key qualities of DIY monitors: transparent modularity, open-endedness, heirloom, and disruptiveness, and how they contribute to more meaningful engagement with the DIY monitors, elevating them from the status of unremarkable objects to that of things.

Geographically distributed open hardware communities often conduct user feedback and peer critique sessions via video conference. However, people have difficulty using current video conferencing tools to demonstrate and critique physical designs. To examine the challenges of remote critique, we conducted an observational lab study in which participants critiqued pairs of physical prototypes (prosthetic hands) for a face-to-face or remote collaborator. In both conditions, participants' material experiences were an important part of their critique, however their attention was divided between interacting with the prototype and finding strategies to communicate `invisible' features. Based on our findings, we propose design implications for remote collaboration tools that support the sharing of material experiences and prototype critique.", "Tangible learning is a promising branch, especially for scientific learning, allowing an enhanced sensorial involvement and participation by children.

This strategy centrally involves the downstream firms distributing design costs over multiple down-stream firms-a strategy that is routine to producers selling to multiple down-stream firms but which has been in the past typically not practical for coalitions of downstream firms. Today, downstream firms find it increasingly feasible to codesign products they may all purchase because of two technological trends. First, computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing and other design technologies are lowering downstream firms' costs to develop designs for purchased hardware inputs. Second, better communication technologies are lowering the costs of doing such projects collaboratively, even among large groups of downstream customer firms. Downstream firms collaborating to develop a design for a hardware input they can all purchase could in principle choose to protect their design as a club good. However, opening up collaboratively created designs to free riders can increase the profits of the contributing firms for several reasons we explore and model. Important among these is that free revealing draws free riders away from purchases of proprietary software or hardware to customer-developed free substitutes. This \"scale-stealing\" mechanism reduces the markets of up-stream suppliers of competing proprietary inputs. In the case of hardware only, free riders also contribute to reducing the average manufacturing costs of the open hardware by increasing purchase volumes and so creating increased economies of scale. Resulting reduced unit purchase costs benefit downstream firms contributing to the free design as well as free riders.", ["The AIDA-2020 Trigger Logic Unit (TLU) has been designed to be a flexible and easily configurable unit to provide trigger and control signals to devices employed during test beams, integrating them with the beam telescope.

A custom-made electrical stimulator was integrated via inserting two carbon rod electrodes into a perfusion bioreactor, housing multiple neonatal Sprague-Dawley rat cardiac cell constructs between two 96% open-pore-area fixing nets. The stimulator produced adjustable stimulation waveform (i.e., duty cycle, number of stimulating channels, maximum stimulation amplitude, etc.), specially designed for cardiac cell stimulation. The cell constructs were subjected to a homogenous fluid flow regime and electrical stimulation under conditions optimal for cell excitation. The stimulation threshold in the bioreactor was set by first determining its value in a Petri dish under a microscope, and then matching the current density in the two cultivation systems by constructing electric field models. The models were built by Comsol Multiphysics software using the exact three-dimensional geometry of the two cultivation systems. These models illustrate, for the first time, the local electric conditions required for cardiomyocyte field excitation and they confirmed the uniformity of the electrical field around the cell constructs. Bioreactor cultivation for only 4 days under perfusion and continuous electrical stimulus (74.4 mA/cm(2), 2 ms, bipolar, 1 Hz) promoted cell elongation and striation in the cell constructs and enhanced the expression level of Connexin-43, the gap junction protein responsible for cell-cell coupling.

Extant studies are conflicting, especially with respect to the importance of the monetary reward as a motivation. Moreover, literature supports our premise from the individuals' motivations analysis viewpoint, but not from the companies' perspective. Finally, literature does not consider the differences related to different members and to different phases of the innovation process. First, we base the literature on open innovation on the Internet (crowdsourcing, peer production and open source) to identify the potential motivations. We then deeply analyse 116 OIPs to determine if the motivations can be a function of the phase of innovation and the dependency on members. We show that the design of the motivational system should take into consideration the different stages of the innovation process and that the OIPs should consider moving from 'work place' logic to 'social place' logic.", "Electronic equipment cooling processes require development of more and more complex systems. In order to achieve adequate cooling, phenomena like Joule Thomson, Peltier or the thermal tube principle are now employed. Correct Central processing unit (CPU) functioning imposes use of efficient heat exchangers. Experimental investigations showed a different behavior for heat radiators, depending on the flow channels configuration and chosen route for the air circulated by the system fan. For the present study, the adopted mathematical model takes into consideration several aspects, such as flow regime, air viscosity, microchannel physical parameters and characteristics of CPU-cooler interface material. Temperature variations in CPU area were analytically calculated starting from a Holman model, completed by resolution of Fourier equations for a stationary unidirectional regime, with parallel flat walls, and internal heat sources. The CPU was assumed to generate all the heat. A CPU cooling system behavior was investigated using a heat transfer model, created in ANSYS, for the above-mentioned conditions.", null, "Our group has designed, sourced and constructed a radiosonde/ground-station pair using inexpensive open-source hardware.

Usually, web technologies have been introduced to complement the control systems with smart add-ons and user friendly services or, for instance, to safely allow access to the control system to users from remote sites. Despite this still narrow spectrum of employment, some software technologies developed for high-performance web services, although originally intended and optimized for these particular applications, deserve some features suggesting a deeper integration in a control system and, eventually, their use to develop some of the control system's core components. In this paper, we present the conceptual design of a new control system for a particle accelerator and associated machine data acquisition system, based on a synergic combination of a nonrelational key/value database and network distributed object caching. The use of these technologies, to implement respectively continuous data archiving and data distribution between components, brought about the definition of a new control system concept offering a number of interesting features such as a high level of abstraction of services and components and their integration in a framework that can be seen as a comprehensive service provider that both graphical user interface applications and front-end controllers join for accessing and, to some extent, expanding its functionalities.", ["The Navy will be building new classes of surface combatants. The platform mission sets will change significantly throughout their lives. Between design, production of the lead ships, and production of ship classes, the decisions made during the design phase will impact the Navy for as long as the next 70 years. The Navy is applying modular and Open Systems Architecture (OSA)[1] strategy that promotes innovation, fair competition, risk reduction, and the rapid incorporation of prototypes and upgrades for new capabilities to address evolving warfighter needs.

For the water sport of rowing, managers and coaches use a motorboat to follow a rowing boat for coaching and safe rowing observation. Utilization of a motorboat gives rise to numerous problems in terms of pulled waves, narrow visual ranges, limited tracking of boats at any one time, fuel consumption, and maintenance costs. Moreover, rowing boats present collision risks to other rowing boats or obstacles floating on water, especially for a cox-less rowing boat because the visual direction for rowers is opposite to the moving direction. The aim of this study is to actualize rowing aerial photography using a Micro Air Vehicle (MAV): a radio-controlled small multi-rotor helicopter that has become popularly used for numerous applications recently. We obtained rowing movies using three-camera compositional patterns with changing altitudes and tilt angles. We examined the benefits of rowing aerial photography compared with movies obtained from a motorboat with consideration of safety improvement.", "This work demonstrates a low-cost, miniature data repository proof-of-concept.

With propagation delay, infrequent channel updates, lag due to network layer overhead, and time-varying node position or environment characteristics, channel knowledge becomes outdated and CSI-based transmission schemes can experience severe performance degradation. This paper studies the performance of precoding techniques for the multiuser broadcast channel with outdated CSI at the transmitter. Traditional channel models as well as channel realizations measured by a wideband channel sounder are used in the analysis. With measured data from an outdoor urban environment, it is further shown the existence of stable subspaces upon which transmission is possible without any instantaneous CSI at the transmitter. Such transmissions allow for consistent performance curves at the cost of initial suboptimality compared to CSI-based schemes. Copyright (c) 2008.", "This work explores the performance of a multiple-input multiple-output broadcast channel where both the transmitter and receivers have outdated channel knowledge due to node motion or other time-variations in the communication channel. A performance analysis based on measured channel responses reveals significant throughput degradation for optimal linear and nonlinear precoding strategies unless the channel state information (CSI) is frequently fed back to the transmitter. The paper then develops a linear beamforming precoding strategy based on channel distribution information in the form of a full spatial correlation matrix for each user. This algorithm is shown to provide highly stable communication, with a throughput that is higher than that for optimal precoders operating on outdated CSI, in a time-variant environment, indicating that this approach can operate with significantly reduced feedback frequency. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates the use of the well-known Kronecker and Weichselberger models to parameterize the full correlation matrix to enable further reduction in the amount of feedback data required for implementation of the new beamforming technique.", "The biomechanical environment to which cells are exposed is important to their normal growth, development, interaction, and function. Accordingly, there has been much interest in studying the role of biomechanical forces in cell biology and pathophysiology. This has led to the introduction and even commercialization of many experimental devices. Many of the early devices were limited by the heterogeneity of deformation of cells cultivated in different locations of the culture plate membranes and were also attached with complicated technical/electronic efforts resulting in a restriction of the reproducibility of these devices. The objective of this study was to design and build a simple device to allow the application of dose-dependent homogeneous equibiaxial static stretch to cells cultured on flexible silicone membranes to investigate biological and biomedical questions. In addition, cultured neonatal rat atrial cardiomyocytes were stretched with the proposed device with different strain gradients. For the first time with this study we could demonstrate that stretch up to 21% caused dose-dependent changes in biological markers such as the calcineurin activity, modulatory calcineurin-interacting protein-1, voltage-gated potassium channel isoform 4.2, and voltage-gated K+ channel-interacting proteins-2 gene expression and transient outward potassium current densities but not the protein-to-DNA ratio and atrial natriuretic peptide mRNA. With both markers mentioned last, dose-dependent stretch alterations could only be achieved with stretch up to 13%.

Recent applications have demonstrated the potential to improve flood forecasting, enhance rainwater harvesting, and prevent combined sewer overflows. However, adoption of smart water systems has been hindered by a limited number of proven case studies, along with a lack of guidance on how smart water systems should be built. To this end, we review existing solutions, and introduce open storman open-source, end-to-end platform for real-time monitoring and control of watersheds. Open storm includes (i) a robust hardware stack for distributed sensing and control in harsh environments (ii) a cloud services platform that enables system-level supervision and coordination of water assets, and (iii) a comprehensive, web-based how-to guide, available on ; Web: open-storm.org, that empowers newcomers to develop and deploy their own smart water networks. We illustrate the capabilities of the open storm platform through two ongoing deployments: (i) a high-resolution flash-flood monitoring network that detects and communicates flood hazards at the level of individual roadways and (ii) a real-time stormwater control network that actively modulates discharges from stormwater facilities to improve water quality and reduce stream erosion. Through these case studies, we demonstrate the real-world potential for smart water systems to enable sustainable management of water resources.", "The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) offers great potential for collecting air quality data with high spatial and temporal resolutions. The objective of this study is to design and develop a modular UAV-based platform capable of real-time monitoring of multiple air pollutants. The system comprises five modules: the UAV, the ground station, the sensors, the data acquisition (DA) module, and the data fusion (DF) module. The hardware was constructed with off-the-shelf consumer parts and the open source software Ardupilot was used for flight control and data fusion. The prototype UAV system was tested in representative settings. Results show that this UAV platform can fly on pre-determined pathways with adequate flight time for various data collection missions. The system simultaneously collects air quality and high precision X-Y-Z data and integrates and visualizes them in a real-time manner. While the system can accommodate multiple gas sensors, UAV operations may electronically interfere with the performance of chemical-resistant sensors. Our prototype and experiments prove the feasibility of the system and show that it features a stable and high precision spatial-temporal platform for air sample collection. Future work should be focused on gas sensor development, plug-and-play interfaces, impacts of rotor wash, and all-weather designs.", "This work investigates the use of Multi-layered Perceptron Networks (MLP) for attack detection, using the Arduino embedded system as a case study.

From a new sample of start-up firms making 3D printers, we show how their degree of openness for inbound and outbound knowledge flows relates to the firms' initial capabilities and founding intentions. From this, we suggest that the patterns of openness are influenced more by initial factor endowments than a firm-specific process of emergent strategy development.", "Managerial SummaryInnovative firms often face trade-offs between open and proprietary strategies, particularly in industries and segments where online communities and other collaborations provide a pool of shared knowledge for the entire industry. This study illuminates these trade-offs by comparing the choices made by the founders of 3D printer manufacturers. For products based on modular systems, it shows the range of choices that firms have on their degree of inbound openness (using external technology) and outbound openness (sharing their own technology)as well as the interdependencies of these choices. Finally, it points to long-term implications of early entrepreneurial decisions: firms that leverage external technology can enter markets more quickly, but their innovation options will be limited unless they have capabilities for proprietary innovation."], "In this paper, we present the construction of a reliable and inexpensive pH stat device, by using open-source \"OpenPhControl\" software, inexpensive hardware (a peristaltic and a syringe pump, Arduino, a step motor...), readily available laboratory devices: a pH meter, a computer, a webcam, and some 3D printed parts. We provide a methodology for the design, development and test results of each part of the device, as well as of the entire system. In addition to dosing reagents by means of a low-cost peristaltic pump, we also present carefully controlled dosing of reagents by an open-source syringe pump. The upgrading of the basic open-source syringe pump is given in terms of pump control and application of a larger syringe.

In particular, novel assistive technologies are being developed to make accessible street navigation to impaired people. The solution that we propose in this new application domain of intelligent transportation systems is a framework for a safe point-to-point navigation, owing to high-detailed road graphs, including sidewalks, crosswalks, and generic \"obstacles.\" The system is based on a low-cost modular sensor box (embedded hardware) interfaced with a mobile/phone application that acts as an intelligent navigator. The main novelty is the capability to sense the surrounding area while being able to perform a fast path replanning, owing to a real-time link to a remote server, if an obstacle is detected. The sensing is performed using different sensors, such as ultrasound, lidar, and a 77-GHz mid-range automotive radar (absolutely novel in the AAL context), which are processed and fused in the well-established robot operating system (ROS).

Technological progress in fields, such as artificial intelligence, computer science, speech simulation, image processing, and remote controls, has led to advances in robotic technology [1]. Interaction between human and robot can be separated into two general categories: remote, where the human and the robot are separated in space or time, and proximate, where the human and the robot may be found in the same location [2]. These two general categories can be further distinguished between applications that require mobility, physical manipulation, or social interaction. Social interactions with robots are more proximate rather than remote. The purpose of this paper is to design the architecture of a robotic system and understand how it might assist people with disabilities and help them stay independent longer.

Furthermore, the White Rabbit network also enables direct digitization and trigger-less data acquisition mode for each detector, which will greatly reduce the complexity and improve the performance of the data acquisition (DAQ) system.

White Spaces refer to regions of radio spectrum that are not used all the time in a specific geographical location. This paper presents the preliminary performance assessment of a TV White Spaces deployment in Malawi. The method used involved coverage simulations at the TV White Spaces frequencies, deployment of the network, monitoring and performance analysis. The preliminary results report usable coverage distance up to 7.5 km which has allowed that remote students access the content of the university library and interact with the university faculty. The results thus show that the TV White Spaces technology can be used for broadband connectivity in rural and undeserved areas even when the WiFi and broadcasting spectrum is already utilized.

In addition, because all of these C4ISR and EW systems compete for extremely limited Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum and Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) resources, they are prohibitively costly to integrate and procure, and their performance suffers from many conflicting requirements.

IoT devices are currently being used in many fields. IoT devices use Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, however, communication distance is short and battery consumption is high. In areas such as smart cities and smart farms, IoT technology is needed to support a wide coverage with low power consumption. Low Power Wide Area (LPWA), which is a transmission used in IoT supporting a wide area with low power consumption, has evolved. LPWA includes Long Range (LoRa), Narrowband (NB-IoT), and Sigfox. LoRa offers many benefits as it communicates the longest distances, is cheap and consumes less battery. LoRa is used in many countries and covers a range of hundreds of square kilometers (km(2)) with a single gateway. However, if there are many obstacles to smart cities and smart farms, it causes communication problems. This paper proposes two (2) solutions to this problem: the relay method which is a multi-hop method and the Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) system that detects packet loss in real-time and requests retransmission for LoRa. In this study, the actual performance of LoRa in the problematic environment was measured and the proposed method was applied. It was confirmed that the transmission rate of LoRa dropped when there were many obstacles such as trees. To use LoRa in a smart farm with a lot of space, multi-hop was observed to be better. An ARQ system is needed to compensate for the unexpected drop in the forward rate due to the increase in IoT devices. This research focused on reliability, however, additional network methods and automatic repeat request (ARQ) systems considering battery time should be researched in symmetry.

The advantage of using a personally developed solution is its open structure, which allows various tests and measurements to be performed, and that is highly convenient for educational and research purposes.

To approach an ideal experiment, we (a) employ a matching procedure and (b) exploit the unexpected adoption of Microsoft Kinect as a motion-sensing technology in research. We evaluate the impact of Kinect and its embodiment of new knowledge on a set of ability-matched, diversity-varying researchers without prior experience in motion-sensing and find that diversified researchers explore more successfully than their more specialized peers. We also examine the role of personal preferences and professional incentives as antecedents of diversification and find that culture, age and intellectual freedom are positively associated with the propensity to diversify successfully. Managerial Summary Organizations where R&D is core to driving competitive advantage face important tradeoffs when hiring researchers. Specifically, diverse combinations of knowledge generate the most impactful discoveries. Yet, coordinating such combinations increasingly requires larger teams as knowledge accumulation causes researchers to specialize in narrower areas. How should organizations achieve the best balance? We argue and show evidence that diversified researchers, individuals routinely criticized for their lack of knowledge depth, are more likely than specialized researchers of similar ability to integrate new knowledge from beyond their domains of expertise to create impactful innovations. Therefore, organizations aiming to create competitive advantage by pushing the boundaries of knowledge should carefully consider the nuanced tradeoffs between specialized and diversified researchers when strategizing about hiring the optimal types of expertise.", "With the rapid development of technology and the competitive technology revolution, climate monitoring systems too have gained more advanced in vast functionalities.

Direct CT guidance allows physicians to localize tumours quickly; however, needle insertion is still performed by hand. This system is mounted to a fully active motion stage superior to the patient's head and teleoperated by a radiologist. Unlike other similar robots, this robot's fully serial-link approach uses a unique combination of belt and cable drives for high-transparency and minimal-backlash, allowing for an expansive working area and numerous approach angles to targets, all while maintaining a small in-bore cross-section of less than 16cm(2). Simulations verified the system's expansive collision free work-space and ability to hit targets across the entire chest, as required for lung cancer biopsy. Targeting error was on average < 1mm on a teleoperated accuracy task, illustrating the system's sufficient accuracy to perform biopsy procedures. While this system was developed for lung biopsies, it can be easily modified for other CT-guided needle based procedures.

Recent news regarding global warming has increased the need to save energy. In Finland, one of the major sources of energy consumption is housing. Furthermore, the heating of residential buildings accounts for up to 68% of housing energy consumption. Therefore, it is not surprising that apartment energy consumption and ways to save energy in housing are a popular research topic in Finland. In this paper, two different research areas are introduced: First, a literature survey is presented on the research subjects of energy saving in the area of real estate and housing. The goal is to gain overall knowledge of the current state of energy saving research. The overall conclusion is that knowledge of energy consumption improves efforts toward energy saving. Second, rapid prototyping with off-the-shelf devices and open source software are described. These devices are cheap to install, and a wide range of sensors are available. Consequently, it is important to deal with these topics together. The former studies provide knowledge about the usage of open hardware, open software, and open architectures with the development of prototype systems for gathering data.

It is based on a reconfigurable, high-performance, 16-channel time-to-digital converter implemented in a Xilinx 7 Series 28-nm field programmable gate array device. Each channel provides timestamps with a least significant bit of 2 ps that states the resolution, whereas instead the single-shot precision is below 12.5 ps rms with the possibility of multihit measures at the maximum rate of 20 MHz. The default width of the full-scale range is 157 mu s that can be extended at users choosing up to 15 days by means of proper time tagging procedures made available. The instrument achieves performance in terms of precision, resolution, and full-scale range of measurement at the state-of-art of existing solutions. The novelty is that besides performance, the presented instrument is totally reconfigurable by the user both in the hardware and in the firmware parts.

In addition, parametric modeling is encouraged in order to facilitate customization for other experiments. Parametric design using a solid modeling programming language allows customization and provides a source file for the design. OpenSCAD is the most widely used scripting tool for parametric modeling of open source labware. However, OpenSCAD lacks the ability to export to standard parametric formats; thus, the parametric dimensional information of the model is lost. This is an important deficiency because it is key to share the design in the most accessible formats with no information loss. In this work we analyze OpenSCAD and compare it with FreeCAD Python scripts. We have created a parametric open source hardware design to compare these tools. Our findings show that although Python for FreeCAD is more arduous to learn, its advantages counterbalance the initial difficulties. The main benefits are being able to export to standard parametric models; using Python language with its libraries; and the ability to use and integrate the models in its graphical interface. Thus, making it more appropriate to design open source hardware for scientific equipment.", ["Purpose: : Children with epilepsy in low-income countries often go undiagnosed and untreated.

The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) stated that years 2015, 2016 and 2017 were the warmest since 1850. According to the preliminary data analysis of the last year, this trend is going to continue in 2018 as well. These climatic changes have accelerated the occurrence of droughts in many parts of the world including Europe and Asia. The North Western region is one such region in Sri Lanka which always affected by droughts due to its inherent dry weather condition. Although drought is considered as a normal part of the climate, its increasing negative impacts on human activities and the environment urges the application of novel technologies in drought monitoring. The 4onse project (analysis of Open, Non-conventional, Sustainable and Effective monitoring systems), funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), is a project began in this context to address the aforementioned mentioned issues by deploying 27 open technologies based Environmental Monitoring Systems (EMS) in Deduru Oya basin of Sri Lanka. These systems measure weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, pressure, rainfall, wind speed and wind direction. Thanks to the collected data, it was possible to calculate some drought indexes to evaluate the intensity of the dry periods. The Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) has been selected as the principal indicator to evaluate droughts by integrating the 4onse data together with Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) dataset.", "This work copes with the design and implementation of a wireless sensors network architecture to automatically and continuously monitor, for the first time, the manufacturing process of Sardinian Carasau bread.

There are various methods to save energy in order to fulfill this reduction obligation. The most effective methods are to increase the energy efficiency of the building, which accounts for about 30% of the existing energy consumption in Korea. Most of the existing buildings do not use 30% of the building space. To reduce this, a system such as BEMS (Building Energy Management System) is needed to grasp and monitor the environment inside the low-cost buildings. However, most BEMS systems are very expensive, and small-scale buildings are difficult to apply because of the low cost of investment. In this paper, we propose a system for inferring the energy use status of each space by collecting environmental information of existing buildings using IoT device. The IoT sensor uses the temperature, humidity, CO2 (Carbon Dioxide), and PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor to judge whether the thermal comfort of the room and the room is occupied or not, and whether the energy is efficiently consumed by the space. Finally, the intelligent system can utilize the historical data of the inferred occupant to predict the occupancy in advance for the control.", "The demand of the industry for high performance electric motors has significantly increased nowadays. This has boosted the usage of permanent magnet brushless synchronous motors (BLSM) in many applications where the accuracy and performance requirements are high. Further improvement of the BLSM drive systems performance can be achieved by providing them with adaptive control capabilities. The relative complexity of adaptive control schemes and algorithms and the computational load that they impose have prevented until recently their practical implementation into the industrial servo systems. In this investigation, a neuro-adaptive control scheme where the rule for parameter adaptation is designed by taking into account the variable structure control (VSC) concepts and Lyapunov stability, is proposed and embedded into an inexpensive, available on the market, position control system for brushless synchronous servomotors.

Air pollution, especially fine particulate matter (PM2.5), has raised a series of concerns for public health. As a result, a number of large-scale, low cost PM2.5 monitoring systems have been deployed in several international smart city projects. One of the major challenges for such environmental sensing systems is ensuring the data quality. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection framework (ADF) for large-scale, real-world environmental sensing systems. The framework is composed of four modules: 1) time-sliced anomaly detection (TSAD), which detects spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal anomalies in the real-time sensor measurement data stream; 2) real-time emission detection, which detects potential regional emission sources; 3) device ranking, which provides a ranking for each sensing device; and 4) malfunction detection, which identifies malfunctioning devices. Using real world measurement data from the AirBox project, we demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively identify outliers in the raw measurement data as well as infer anomalous events that are perceivable by the general public and government authorities. Because of its simple design, ADF is highly extensible to other advanced applications, and it can be exploited to support various large-scale environmental sensing systems.", "The aim of this paper is to determine the physical proximity of connected things when they are accessed from a smartphone.

Involving and empowering citizens as active managers of their health represents a desirable shift from the current culture mainly focused on treatment of disease, to one also focused on continuous health management and well-being. Current developments in technological areas such as the Internet of Things (IoT), lead to new technological solutions that can aid this shift in the healthcare sector. This study presents the design, development, implementation and evaluation of a platform called Common Recognition and Identification Platform (CRIP), a part of the CareStore project, which aims at supporting caregivers and citizens to manage health routines in a seamless way. Specifically, the CRIP offers sensor-based support for seamless identification of users and health devices. A set of initial requirements was defined with a focus on usability limitations and current sensor technologies. The CRIP was designed and implemented using several technologies that enable seamless integration and interaction of sensors and people, namely Near Field Communication and fingerprint biometrics for identification and authentication, Bluetooth for communication with health devices and web services for wider integration with other platforms. Two CRIP prototypes were implemented and evaluated in laboratory during a period of eight months. The evaluations consisted of identifying users and devices, as well as seamlessly configure and acquire vital data from the last. Also, the entire Carestore platform was deployed in a nursing home where its usability was evaluated with caregivers. The evaluations helped assess that seamless identification of users and seamless configuration and communication with health devices is feasible and can help enable the IoT on healthcare applications. Therefore, the CRIP and similar platforms could be transformed into a valuable enabling technology for secure and reliable IoT deployments on the healthcare sector.", "Within the last few years, a need for renewed product personalisation has been observed in some markets such as consumer electronics, fashion to meet the exact demands of the customers.

Instead of using a processor with an instruction set, a full stack of middleware, and an application program running on top, the field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) integrate a cell set that can be configured in different ways. A few vendors have dominated this market with their proprietary tools, hardware devices, and boards, resulting in fragmented ecosystems with few standards and little interoperation. However, a new and complete toolchain for FPGAs with its associated open tools has recently emerged from the open-source community. Robotics is an expanding application field that may definitely benefit from this revolution, as fast speed and low power consumption are usual requirements. This paper hypothesizes that basic reactive robot behaviors may be easily designed following the reconfigurable computing approach and the state-of-the-art open FPGA toolchain. They provide new abstractions such as circuit blocks and wires for building intelligent robots. Visual programming and block libraries make such development painless and reliable. As experimental validation, two reactive behaviors have been created in a real robot involving common sensors, actuators, and in-between logic. They have been also implemented using classic software programming for comparison purposes. Results are discussed and show that the development of reactive robot behaviors using reconfigurable computing and open tools is feasible, also achieving a high degree of simplicity and reusability, and benefiting from FPGAs' low power consumption and time-critical responsiveness.", null, null, "Emerging embedded systems and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, which account for a wide range of applications are often highly resource-constrained that are challenging the software-based methods traditionally adopted for detecting and containing cyber-attacks (e.g., malware) in general-purpose computing systems. In addition to the complexity and cost (computing and storage), the software-based detection methods mainly rely on the static signature analysis of the running programs, requiring continuous software update which is not affordable for embedded systems and edge devices with limited computing and communication bandwidth. To address these challenges, this work proposes an accurate and cost-efficient micro AI enabled countermeasure for securing modern edge devices against emerging cyber-attacks, i.e., malware and Side-Channel Attacks (SCAs) at the hardware level by monitoring applications' Hardware Performance Counter (HPC) features. To realize a run-time ML-based solution that relies on limited available HPCs in modern edge processors, we first identify the most prominent HPC events for accurate attack detection with the aid of an effective feature selection method. Next, various standard machine learning classifiers are implemented for effective and accurate run-time hardware-assisted malware and side-channel attacks detection. They are compared and characterized in terms of detection accuracy, F-measure, robustness, latency, power consumption, and hardware overheads. Experimental results demonstrate that the J48 classifier achieves the highest detection rate (F-measure) for both malware and SCAs detection with 0.917 and 0.987, respectively, with relatively negligible latency and area overhead as compared to complex models making it a suitable algorithm for enabling an efficient hardware-assisted micro AI countermeasure in edge devices.", "According to the World Health Organisation, 28% of people aged older than 65 years fall every year, with the frequency of falls increasing with age.

Today, robotics training tools are raised with the aim of promoting innovation and motivation of students during the learning process. Robots are becoming more and more common in our daily lives; therefore, it is important to integrate robots into all levels of our society.

A project-based pedagogical methodology is used. Experiments are promoted, where trial and error are part of learning and self-discovery. The student learns to have more autonomy and responsibility. Knowledge is acquired in different disciplines. It develops: motor skills (scale mobility in the hands), group skills, allowing people to socialize, creative abilities, and learning in a fun way. The operational details, materials used and examples of activities for some modules are also presented with the expectation that all teachers will be able to adapt these activities in their class. In addition, results are included from several groups of students who have already completed some modules. Despite not having a large number of students, the experience provided results that may be useful for other teachers to promote a course with similar or equal content for more results.

In this article, the sum of a wavefield recorded at two locations in a single channel is used to estimate the Green's function via the autocorrelation; the result contains some predicted artefacts. The underlying theory and hardware required to estimate the Green's function is presented and compared to traditional seismic interferometry. This technique is used to estimate the elastic Green's function between two locations on an aluminum block with surface scatterers. Wavefields excited via rapid thermoelastic expansion of the surface using a pulsed laser are detected by a dual-beam heterodyne interferometer. The detector is capable of directly recording the sum of a wavefield measured at two locations in a single channel.

TSCH is the emerging standard for industrial automation and process control for Low-power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) that uses time synchronization to achieve low-power operation and channel hopping to enable high reliability. Particularly, the 6TiSCH (IPv6 over the TSCH mode of IEEE 802.15.4e) mechanisms are crucial for the further adoption of IPv6 in industrial standards. However, the 6TiSCH standard does not define or propose a particular scheduling and routing algorithms, whose definition is left to the designers. Therefore, in order to evaluate 6TiSCH performance, we have adopted one particular centralized scheduling policy based on graph coloring technique, named Joint Scheduling and Routing Algorithm (JSRA) and applied within the OpenWSN 6TiSCH protocol stack. For experimentations, we used the OpenMote hardware and OpenWSN software platform for IoT applications.

Using computer simulations, the measurement accuracy in the presence of IQI and PN is evaluated using the normalized mean square error, which provides a design guideline for the realization of hardware.", "Current research in evolutionary robotics is largely focused on creating controllers by either evolving neural networks or refning genetic programs based on grammar trees. We propose the use of the dataow languages for the construction of effective robotic controllers and the evolution of new controllers using genetic programming techniques. These languages have the advantages of being built on concurrent execution frameworks that lend themselves to formal verification along with being visualized as a dataow graph. In this paper, we compare and contrast the development and subsequent evolution of one such process-oriented control algorithm. Our control software was built from compos-able, communicating processes executing in parallel, and we tested our solution in an annual fire-fighting robotics competition. Subsequently, we evolved new controllers in a virtual simulation of this parallel dataow domain, and in doing so discovered and quantified more efficient solutions.

Significant improvements to the system in recent years are presented. Fusion reaction rates, as high as 10(7) s(-1) and 10(6) s(-1) for DD and (DHe)-He-3, respectively, are now well regulated with a new ion source and electronic gas control system. Charged fusion products are more accurately characterized, which allows for better calibration of existing nuclear diagnostics. In addition, in situ measurements of the on-target beam profile, made with a CCD camera, are used to determine the metrology of the fusion-product source for particle-counting applications. Finally, neutron diagnostics development has been facilitated by detailed Monte Carlo N-Particle Transport (MCNP) modeling of neutrons in the accelerator target chamber, which is used to correct for scattering within the system. These recent improvements have resulted in a versatile platform, which continues to support the existing nuclear diagnostics while simultaneously facilitating the development of new diagnostics in aid of the National Ignition Campaign at the National Ignition Facility.

Typical requirements of ordinary things, such as low power consumption, small size, and low cost, demand innovative solutions.

Despite of making up a rather heterogeneous public, DIYbio groups are organized around a concern to make biology accessible, easy and enjoyable. DlYbio combines an open source ethos, with a DIY will to do things and the joy to mess with biological matter. As biohacking is about de-composing and re-composing things, DIYbio takes on a particular approach to the making of the new and to the making of futures that this paper explores. Inspired by Heidegger's notion of the thing, I suggest that differing from institutionalized forms of biology, DlYbio produces things rather than techno-objects. I go into this point by first situating DIYbio in relation to synthetic biology and other instutionalised forms of biology. To explore how DlYbio takes on a particular approach to the making of the new, I look at a number of things that DlYbio groups have projected, designed and realized. I suggest that DlYbio combines a sort of individual craftiness and self-determination to do things with a praxis in which things are always in the making, waiting for the next realization. DIYbio take on an approach to the making of things and futures that is immediate and mundane. Yet, as an emerging public, DlYbio relies on an ambiguous relation to institutionalized science, and might be turned into a transfer of materialities and temporalities from public domains to science.

As with new ideas that hold immense potential, the optimism of IoT has also exaggerated the underlying technologies well before they can mature into a sustainable ecosystem. While 6LoWPAN has emerged as a disruptive technology that brings IP capability to networks of resource constrained devices, a suitable radio technology for this device class is still debatable. In the recent past, Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) - a subset of the Bluetooth v4.0 stack -has surfaced as an appealing alternative that provides a low-power and loosely coupled mechanism for sensor data collection with ubiquitous units (e.g., smartphones and tablets).

This technology has gained significant academic as well as industry interest due to its ability to create complex geometries with customizable material properties. AM has also inspired the development of the maker movement by democratizing design and manufacturing. Due to the rapid proliferation of a wide variety of technologies associated with AM, there is a lack of a comprehensive set of design principles, manufacturing guidelines, and standardization of best practices. These challenges are compounded by the fact that advancements in multiple technologies (for example materials processing, topology optimization) generate a \"positive feedback loop\" effect in advancing AM.

The goal of our review paper is to organize this body of knowledge surrounding AM, and present current barriers, findings, and future trends significantly to the researchers.

They may be hosted by civic communities, corporations or public institutions. Working individually or in teams, usually for several days, participants develop projects such as hardware or software prototypes. Based on a digital ethnography of two events in the Netherlands and Denmark, this article investigates project development practices at hackathons. In particular, it analyses how participants organized their project work and which technologies were used in support of their creative endeavours. Hackathons are increasingly competitive rather than collaborative events, involving time pressure, inducements such as prizes, and requiring efficient skills utilization. I argue that this facilitates the following tendencies: Firstly, strategic effort is put into final presentations. Projects need to be convincingly presented, and persuasively pitching an idea becomes crucial. Secondly, there is only limited time for personal learning, since participants' existing skills need to be efficiently applied if a team wants to stay competitive. This encourages division of labour within groups: a tendency which seems especially problematic given that IT skills biases are often expressed in terms of gender. Thirdly, participants are more inclined to use technologies that are proprietary but appear 'open enough'. In light of this observation and by drawing on the concept of technology as resource and opportunity, I discuss the techno-political implications of utilized technologies. With this analysis, I aim at contributing to the critical debate on hackathons as productive but likewise ideologically significant fields of 'hacking cultures'.", "HCI recognizes the importance of visions as both a design and futuring approach and a problem-solving technique.

Analyzing this fast growing, large data set requires efficient and reliable detection routines. Currently most meteor echo routines search for underdense meteor trails, often discarding overdense and nonspecular meteor trails. This is because their main purpose is the study of mesospheric winds. But the study of meteor flux requires the unique identification of each type of meteor reflections. In this paper, a multilayer radar detection and classification algorithm is proposed to correctly identify multiple types of meteor trail reflections. The process consists of two steps. The first step is based on the time-frequency waveform detector. In this step, we start by selecting low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values in order to detect all types of radar echoes; however, a high probability offalse alarm is often produced. In the second step, several features from the detected echoes in step one are extracted and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier is constructed to further classify these echoes. The algorithm was tested using data collected from a 50-MHz radar stationed near Salinas, Puerto Rico, on April 5, 1998. A total of 270 detected echoes were labeled as underdense, overdense, nonspecular, other ionospheric echoes, and noise. We used 50% of the labeled echoes as training samples and divided the rest 50% testing samples as 10 subsets for testing. This technique successfully classified about 85% of the testing samples.

Closed-loop experiments, in which causal interventions are conditioned on the state of the system under investigation, have become increasingly common in neuroscience. Such experiments can have a high degree of explanatory power, but they require a precise implementation that can be difficult to replicate across laboratories. We sought to overcome this limitation by building open-source software that makes it easier to develop and share algorithms for closed-loop control. Approach. We created the Open Ephys GUI, an opensource platform for multichannel electrophysiology experiments. In addition to the standard 'open-loop' visualization and recording functionality, the GUI also includes modules for delivering feedback in response to events detected in the incoming data stream. Importantly, these modules can be built and shared as plugins, which makes it possible for users to extend the functionality of the GUI through a simple API, without having to understand the inner workings of the entire application. Main results. In combination with low-cost, open-source hardware for amplifying and digitizing neural signals, the GUI has been used for closedloop experiments that perturb the hippocampal theta rhythm in a phase-specific manner.

People long wait for arriving of buses and suddenly gather near bus when it arrives and travel in overcrowded buses on footboards which leads to accidents. Theft is another risk of overcrowding. All this happens due to lack of proper information of arriving of buses at many of the bus stops. To solve this problem in a cost effective way, we have developed an IoT based bus tracking system to show the current location of the bus and seat availability in the arriving buses.

Second, we propose an optimal algorithm selection and detail architecture for automotive real-time environments through machine learning algorithms (KNN, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression) and deep learning algorithms (RNN-LSTM). Finally, we describe system-wide integration and implementation through the open source hardware Raspberry Pi and the machine learning SW framework We provide optimal LSTM architecture and implementation that takes into account the real-time environmental conditions and how to improve the readability and usability of the vehicle motion data. We also share the rapid prototyping methodology case of connected car systems without other sensor devices.", "This paper explores the concept of the circular economy within the context of fashion and textile design in the UK, and does so from the textile and fashion perspectives to explore how this might be achieved. Within the UK alone, we dispose of approximately 10,000 garments every ten minutes (Kerr & Foster, 2011). This project focuses specifically on the practice of textile and fashion design in the UK to consider a more holistic approach for designing and manufacturing within these sectors. Our research aims are to explore the contribution open design can make in implementing the circular economy and thus a more sustainable material future. We ask what are the new models and systems of production that will support a circular economy in textiles? In this work we propose a vision for circular economic models of production in fashion and textiles that adopt open design approaches.", "Currently, the manufacturing industry is experiencing a data-driven revolution. There are multiple processes in the manufacturing industry and will eventually generate a large amount of data. Collecting, analyzing and storing a large amount of data are one of key elements of the smart manufacturing industry. To ensure that all processes within the manufacturing industry are functioning smoothly, the big data processing is needed. Thus, in this study an open source-based real-time data processing (OSRDP) architecture framework was proposed. OSRDP architecture framework consists of several open sources technologies, including Apache Kafka, Apache Storm and NoSQL MongoDB that are effective and cost efficient for real-time data processing. Several experiments and impact analysis for manufacturing sustainability are provided. The results showed that the proposed system is capable of processing a massive sensor data efficiently when the number of sensors data and devices increases. In addition, the data mining based on Random Forest is presented to predict the quality of products given the sensor data as the input. The Random Forest successfully classifies the defect and non-defect products, and generates high accuracy compared to other data mining algorithms. This study is expected to support the management in their decision-making for product quality inspection and support manufacturing sustainability.", "Open source software (OSS) and hardware (OSH) are two expressions of one broader concept and its related movement. One of the most fundamental questions relating to these phenomena is why developers contribute their private resources to these public goods. While this question has been discussed, theorized, and empirically investigated in the context of OSS, there has been no research so far in the context of OSH. Can we really assume the motivations behind the development of the OSH to be the same as those behind OSS? Based on the self-determination theory (SDT), we provide original insights into the motivations behind contributions to OSH development. We collected data from the most common and active 3D printing communities, which are the main loci of OSH development. We thus have a unique cross-sectional data set with participants from over 30 different countries using all kinds of different OSH platforms. Our analysis reveals several important findings: firstly, the motivations are in some aspects very similar to those in open source software notwithstanding different possibilities, hurdles, and incentives regarding the OSS and OSH. Above all, enjoyment-based intrinsic motivation is a major factor affecting contribution levels. Secondly, among internalized extrinsic motivations, expected private benefits through improving own skills stands out. Thirdly, different factors of internalized extrinsic motivations can have different moderating effects on the effect of enjoyment-based intrinsic motivation. Given the imminent changes in business models throughout manufacturing industries in order to adapt to the challenge that OSH will increasingly pose, our findings have important implications not only for OSH communities and 3D development platforms, but also for businesses that want and probably soon have to engage in open innovation.", "There are different requirements on cybersecurity of industrial control systems and information technology systems. This fact exacerbates the global issue of hiring cybersecurity employees with relevant skills. In this paper, we present KYPO4INDUSTRY training facility and a course syllabus for beginner and intermediate computer science students to learn cybersecurity in a simulated industrial environment. The training facility is built using opensource hardware and software and provides reconfigurable modules of industrial control systems. The course uses a flipped classroom format with hands-on projects: the students create educational games that replicate real cyber attacks. Throughout the semester, they learn to understand the risks and gain capabilities to respond to cyber attacks that target industrial control systems. Our described experience from the design of the testbed and its usage can help any educator interested in teaching cybersecurity of cyber-physical systems.", "In this article a gateway module to integrate legacy laboratory devices into the network of the digital laboratory in the 21st century is introduced. The device is based on ready to buy consumer hardware that is easy to get and inexpensive. Depending on the specific requirements of the desired application (bare embedded computer, RS232 serial port connector, IP65 certified casing and connectors) the needed investment ranges from about 95 (sis) up to 200 (sis). The embedded computer runs an open source Linux operating system and can in principle be used to run any kind of software needed for communicating with the laboratory device. Here the open source SiLA2 standard is used for presenting the device's functions in the network. As an example the digital integration of a magnetic stirrer is shown and can be used as a template for other applications. A method for easy remote integration of the device to ensure an easy and consistent workflow in development, testing and usage is also presented. This incorporates a method for remote installation of SiLA2 servers on the box as well as a web frontend for administration, debugging and management of those. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Previous oceanographic modelling and current drifter data have been used to predict the movement and accumulation of plastic pollution in the marine environment, but our understanding of the transport and fate through riparian systems is still largely unknown. Here we undertook a proof of concept study by applying open source tracking technology (both GPS (Global Positing System) cellular networks and satellite technology), which have been successfully used in many animal movement studies, to track the movements of individual plastic litter items (500 ml PET (polyethylene terephthalate) drinks bottles) through the Ganges River system (known as the Ganga in India and the Padma and Meghna in Bangladesh, hereafter known as the Ganges) and the Bay of Bengal. Deployed tags were successfully tracked through the Ganges river system and into the Bay of Bengal marine system. The \"bottle tags\" were designed and built (e.g. shape, size, buoyancy) to replicate true movement patterns of a plastic bottle. The maximum distance tracked to date is 2845 km over a period of 94 days. We discuss lessons learnt from the development of these plastic litter tags, and outline how the potential widespread use of this open source technology has the ability to significantly increase understanding of the location of accumulation areas and the timing of large inputs of plastic pollution into the aquatic system. Furthermore, \"bottle tags\" may act as a powerful tool for stimulating social behaviour change, informing science-based policy, and as valuable educational outreach tools for public awareness.", "In this study, applications of the Arduino platform in the mining industry were reviewed. Arduino, a representative and popular open-source hardware, can acquire information from various sensors, transmit data using communication technology, and control devices through actuators. The review was conducted by classifying previous studies into three types of Arduino applications: field monitoring systems, wearable systems, and autonomous systems. With regard to field monitoring systems, most studies in mines were classified as atmospheric or geotechnical monitoring. In wearable systems, the health status of the miner was an important consideration, in addition to the environmental conditions of the mine. Arduino can be a useful tool as an initial prototype for autonomous mine systems. Arduino has advantages in that it can be combined with various electronic products and is cost-effective. Therefore, although many studies have been conducted in the laboratory (as opposed to field tests), Arduino applications can be further expanded in the mining field in the future.", "This chapter discusses the mechanical properties of samples made using 3D printing using Fused Deposition Modeling. At present, there is a great popularity of cheap RepRap 3D printers. One of these printers is Prusa i3 printers. The advantage of this printer is its low purchase price and low cost of ownership. This 3D printer allows infinitely many options for setting up 3D printing itself. The chapter describes Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) printing technology, the use of materials, and the effect of setting up padding for printed items. The product is mainly aimed at adjusting the hexagonal charge of the measured samples and then evaluating the strength of these samples. It is known that a hexagonal structure called a honeycomb is the basis for lightweight cores. For usage of this hexagonal structure in conventional application, it is needed to know properties of material with different dimension. Measured values of material properties are evaluated at the end of this chapter.", "The VLSI technology and scaling roadmap has always included Process technology (wrapped as \"PDK\"), VLSI designs themselves (\"System Drivers\"), and EDA technology (\"Design Technology\"). Today, we see an open-source foundry PDK, and we see a vibrant open-source hardware design ecosystem. But what about open-source EDA? The development of open-source EDA technology cannot be separated from the question, \"If we build it, who will come?\" Today's talk will try to provide some thoughts on this question. What is \"it\"? Who is \"we\"? Who is \"who\"? And in what ways will the \"who\" come to interact with open-source EDA?", "Inclusion of hydrological modelling approaches for making water release decisions is not practiced among water practitioners of Sri Lanka due to inadequacy of quality data, high purchasing cost of modelling software and lack of expertise knowledge on handling modelling tools. During the rainy periods, they face difficulties in taking timely decisions on deciding the magnitude of inflows to the reservoirs, for the safe disposal of excess flow. Currently, the water from the reservoir is released once it reaches to a particular threshold. This creates floods in the lower basin due to the massive water flow released from the reservoirs. Therefore, for a low-income country, a total open source framework amalgamated with low cost open source hardware and free open source software, standards and data, was seen as the only possible mean to overcome the flood risk associated with reservoirs. Hence, the aim of this study is to demonstrate the capability of such a system in simulating the inflows to the reservoir, triggered during the rainfall events. The calibration and validation results of the model have discovered the capability of the open source technologies-based system in decision making pertaining to water resources management. As the model operates as a semi-distributed continuous model at hourly time-step, it doesn't demand massive amount of data and not required to apply initial discharge at every occasion that the model runs.", "Increasing urbanisation and a better understanding of the negative health effects of air pollution have accelerated the use of Internet of Things (IoT)-based air quality sensors. Low-cost and low-power sensors are now readily available and commonly deployed by individuals and community groups. However, there are a wide range of such IoT devices in circulation that differently focus on problems of sensor validation, data reliability, or accessibility. In this paper, we present AirKit, which was developed as an integrated and open source \"social IoT technology\". AirKit enables a comprehensive approach to citizen-sensing air quality through several integrated components: (1) the Dustbox 2.0, a particulate matter sensor; (2) Airsift, a data analysis platform; (3) a reliable and automatic remote firmware update system; (4) a \"Data Stories\" method and tool for communicating citizen data; and (5) an AirKit logbook that provides a guide for designing and running air quality projects, along with instructions for building and using AirKit components.

It was a completely new concept that elevated many questions than it responded. We've been hearing more recently about the consequences of not using the cloud. Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web-Services (AWS), and Google Cloud-Platform (GCP), among others, have constructed complicated cloud systems that are operating the agenda of cloud and delivering innovative novel solutions to satisfy the requirements of modern enterprises. Hyperscale data centres are increasingly turning to specialist chips like GPUs (Graphics Processing-Units), FPGAs (Field-Programmable-Gating-Arrays), and ASICs when it comes to processors, which are at the heart of the cloud, it is also considered as the part of an AI (Artificial Intelligence) discovery process, thus a quantitative study on database server design has also been included.

The common example is real-time communication worst-case jitter analysis. This paper introduces an easy to implement approach how to create a logic analyzer for such kind of task on a basis of a low-cost Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) kit and a personal computer. The Author provides both sample FPGA design files compatible with an open-source toolchain and the approach how to collect data using standard software and Octave scripts to post-process the experimental result.

The approach presents a flexible and complete integration method for the digitally assisted workflow. The worker in the laboratory performs procedures in direct interaction with the digitized infrastructure that guides through the process and aids while performing tasks. The digital transformation of the laboratory starts with standardized integration of both new and \"smart\" lab devices, as well as legacy devices through a hardware gateway module. The open source Standardization in Lab Automation 2 standard is used for device communication. A central lab server channels all device communication and keeps a database record of every measurement, task and result generated or used in the lab. It acts as a central entry point for process management. This backbone enables a process control system to guide the worker through the lab process and provide additional assistance, like results of automated calculations or safety information. The description of the infrastructure and architecture is followed by a practical example on how to implement a digitized workflow. This approach is highly useful for - but not limited to - the biotechnological laboratory and has the potential to increase productivity in both industry and research for example by enabling automated documentation.", "Power quality and energy consumption measurements support providers and energy users with solutions for acquiring and reporting information about the energy supply for residential, commercial, and industrial sectors. In particular, since the average number of electronic devices in homes increases year by year and their sensitivity is very high, it is not only important to monitor the total energy consumption, but also the quality of the power supplied. However, in practice, end-users do not have information about the energy consumption in real-time nor about the quality of the power they receive, because electric energy meters are too expensive and complex to be handled. In order to overcome these inconveniences, an innovative, open source, low-cost, precise, and reliable power and electric energy meter is presented that can be easily installed and managed by any inexperienced user at their own home in urban or rural areas. The system was validated in a real house over a period of two weeks, showing interesting results and findings which validate our proposal.", "Simple 3-D printable open source hardware designs have proven to be effective scientific instruments at low costs. Further development in this area is coupling open source electronics with 3-D printable mechanical components to make fully functional distributedly-manufactured mechatronic tools for science. One research area where such low-cost technology is needed is to characterize thin film anti-reflective coatings and transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) for the glass, mirror and solar photovoltaic industry whose transmission properties are angle dependent. To meet this research need a low-cost 3-D printable open source dual axis gimbal system is presented in this study. An Arduino based microcontroller is used to move the sample holder to the user specified angle where two stepper motors control the motion providing two degrees of freedom. The sample holder is made in such a way that samples can easily be mounted on it by two movable latches. The system was validated and characterized for: i) unidirectional accuracy, ii) repeatability, iii) backlash, iv) speed resolution and v) microstep size. Finally, the mechatronic system is tested for the intended application using a halogen light source and a spectrometer to measure transmission through glass TCO samples through a hemisphere. The system performed as expected has a unidirectional accuracy of 2.827 degrees, repeatability of 1.585 degrees, backlash error of 1.237 degrees, maximum speed of 35.156 degrees and a verifiable microstep size of 0.33 degrees. Despite the highest mean squared errors, the open source gimbal system performed adequately while measuring transmission of radiation through glass with TCO coatings. This open source system also represents a 96% cost in savings as compared to the least expensive commercial variant. The high mean squared errors are offset by the cost of the system coupled with its open source nature that promotes further collaboration and hence, development.", "This paper discusses how emerging issues in housing construction could revolutionise the building industry. It focuses on commons-based networks of organisations, technologies and users that form a niche practice on the margins of the dominant paradigm. This practice can be understood as \"Design Global, Manufacture Local\" and is exemplified by the Hexayurt, the Open Source Ecology Microhouse and the WikiHouse. Using these descriptive case studies, light is shed on the challenges and opportunities of open construction systems with regard to technological, institutional and social perspectives.

IoT and advanced health sensors provide more convenience to patients and physicians. Where physicians can now wirelessly and automatically monitor patient's state. While these medical embedded devices provide a lot of new opportunities to improve the health care system, they also introduce a new set of security risks since they are connected to networks. More importantly, these devices are extremely hardware- and power-constrained, which in turn makes securing these devices more complex. Implementing complex malware detectors or anti-virus on these devices is either very costly or infeasible due to these limitations on power and resources.", "In this paper, we propose a new framework called SYNDROME for \"externally\" monitoring medical embedded devices. Our malware detector uses electromagnetic (EM) signals involuntary generated by the device as it executes a (medical) application in the absence of malware, and analyzes them to build a reference model. It then monitors the EM signals generated by the device during execution and reports an error if there is a statistically significant deviation from the reference model. To evaluate SYNDROME, we use open-source software to implement a real-world medical device, called a Syringe Pump, on a variety of well-known embedded/IoT devices including Arduino Uno, FPGA Nios II soft-core, and two Linux IoT mini-computers: OlimexA13 and TS-7250. We also implement a control-flow hijack attack on SyringePump and use SYNDROME to detect and stop the attack. Our experimental results show that using SYNDROME, we can detect the attack for all the four devices with excellent accuracy (i.e. 0% false positive and 100% true positive) within few milliseconds after the attack starts."], null, "Arts, Real-Time Video and Interactivity for Sustainability (ARTiVIS) is an ongoing collaborative research project investigating how real-time video, DIY surveillance technologies and sensor data can be used as a tool for environmental awareness, activism and artistic explorations. The project consists of a series of digital contexts for aesthetic contemplation of nature and civic engagement, aiming to foster awareness and empowerment of local populations through DIY surveillance. At the core of the ARTIVIS efforts are a series of interactive installations (namely B-Wind!, Hug@tree and Play with Fire), that make use of surveillance technologies and real-time video as raw material to promote environmental awareness through the emotion generated by real-time connections with nature. Throughout the project development, the surveillance concept has been shifting from the use of surveillance technology in a centralized platform, to the idea of veillance with distributed peer-to-peer networks that can be used for science and environmental monitoring.

Most of the high-end open-source IoT platforms include built-in peripherals, such as the universal asynchronous receiver and transmitter (UART), pulse width modulation (PWM), general purpose input output (GPIO) ports and timers, and have enough computation power to run embedded operating systems such as Linux. However, each IoT platform has its own way of configuring peripherals, and it is difficult for programmers or users to configure the same peripheral on a different platform. Although diverse open-source IoT platforms are widespread, the difficulty in programming those platforms hinders the growth of IoT applications.

This paper presents an accurate and up-to-date energy consumption model for devices using this IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH mode. The model identifies all network-related CPU and radio state changes, thus providing a precise representation of the device behavior and an accurate prediction of its energy consumption. Moreover, energy measurements were performed with a dual-band OpenMote device, running the OpenWSN firmware. This allows the model to be used for devices using 2.4 GHz, as well as 868 MHz. Using these measurements, several network simulations were conducted to observe the TSCH energy consumption effects in end-to-end communication for both frequency bands. Experimental verification of the model shows that it accurately models the consumption for all possible packet sizes and that the calculated consumption on average differs less than 3% from the measured consumption. This deviation includes measurement inaccuracies and the variations of the guard time. As such, the proposed model is very suitable for accurate energy consumption modeling of TSCH networks.", "The rising popularity of location-based services has prompted considerable research in the field of indoor location systems.

It comes thus at no surprise that more and more microprocessors are integrated into programmable logic devices as they represent the central functionality in many digital systems. In parallel to these technological developments the open-source hardware community grew steadily in the last two decades.

In particular, they storage heat in a larger fraction than bare land. Consequently, it is of interest to analyse the main variable that can characterize this difference, the ambient temperature. We present results of the measurements done with a thermometer (with an estimated maximum uncertainty of 0.2 degrees C) during the period June 2013 - June 2014, in different months of the year with clear sky and non-intense windy climatic conditions. The data were obtained at noon (around 13:00 local hour = Universal Time - 3 hours), traversing the city in the East-West and North-South directions. Particularly, in this work, we analyse the ambient temperature variation between the central dry Montenegro plaza and the Green Urquiza park. The first one is located among medium-height buildings (3 stories as a mean), while the second one is placed about 1770 meters away, in the border of the city, very near the coast of the large Parana river (having it 60 km wide, including the delta islands) The mean temperature difference in the yearly investigated period was +0.7 degrees C, being higher in the central dry plaza than in the green park. Results for different climatic periods are: for autumn-winter, +0.3 degrees C and for spring-summer, +1.1 degrees C. A possible explanation of this behaviour is the different angular incidence of solar radiation at the altitudinal level that air temperature is measured, being lower in autumn-winter (with the Sun at approximately 40 degrees mean elevation angle) than in spring-summer (similar to 70 degrees mean elevation angle). We have also made model calculations, employing the Urban Weather Generator (UWG) model, developed by Bueno et al. at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA. As for the introduction of the climatological and building parameters, we have used climatological data from a rural meteorological station in the Energy Plus weather file format (.epw) and a parametric description of urban area in .xml format. We have also obtained a representation of the temperature behaviour in the central plaza, considering three scenarios. Scenario A represents the rural climate; scenario B portrays the current situation and scenario C verifies the Energy efficiency and solar protection in building N degrees 8757 Ordinance introduced for the first time in Argentina, by the Municipality of Rosario city. The highest temperature was found in scenario B, being 2.5 degrees C higher than in scenario A. Scenario C presents a temperature 1.5 degrees C higher than scenario A. In conclusion, the urban heat island data obtained is of interest in the design of acclimatisation systems (since normally the non-urban airport temperature data is employed). Also, they can be used as a simulation at present of what will happen in the future, due to the temperature increase produced by the emission of greenhouse gases, responsible of the global warming.", "We present a fully-integrated solution for controlling pneumatically-driven microfluidic chips, featuring a pump, one or more pressure regulators and up to 32 solenoid valves, controlled by a microcontroller. The microfluidics control system requires only a power source and a computer or mobile device for its operation. A touchscreen interface communicates with the microcontroller over USB or Bluetooth and allows users to control the system with ease either manually or autonomously, allowing experiments to run with no user intervention. The pressure regulators were purpose-built, enabling integrated pressure sources on-board, rather than relying on external equipment. These regulators can also be used as stand-alone devices in any other application. (C) 2019 The Authors.

This shift has and will continue to place previously isolated agencies in an increasing state of overlap, raising the likelihood of inconsistent regulations and putting seemingly disparate policy goals, like privacy, safety, environmental protection, and copyright enforcement, in tension. This Article explores this problem through a series of case studies and articulates a taxonomy of code regulations to help place hardware-turned-code rules in context. The Article considers the likely turf wars, regulatory thickets, and related dynamics that are likely to arise, and closes by considering the benefits of creating a new agency with some degree of centralized authority over software regulation issues.", "Cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT) are two very different technologies that are both already part of our life. Their adoption and use are expected to be more and more pervasive, making them important components of the Future Internet. A novel paradigm where Cloud and loT are merged together is foreseen as disruptive and as an enabler of a large number of application scenarios. In this paper, we focus our attention on the integration of Cloud and IoT, which is what we call the CloudloT paradigm. Many works in literature have surveyed Cloud and IoT separately and, more precisely, their main properties, features, underlying technologies, and open issues. However, to the best of our knowledge, these works lack a detailed analysis of the new CloudloT paradigm, which involves completely new applications, challenges, and research issues. To bridge this gap, in this paper we provide a literature survey on the integration of Cloud and IoT. Starting by analyzing the basics of both IoT and Cloud Computing, we discuss their complementarity, detailing what is currently driving to their integration. Thanks to the adoption of the CloudloT paradigm a number of applications are gaining momentum: we provide an up-to-date picture of CloudloT applications in literature, with a focus on their specific research challenges. These challenges are then analyzed in details to show where the main body of research is currently heading. We also discuss what is already available in terms of platforms - both proprietary and open source - and projects implementing the CloudloT paradigm. Finally, we identify open issues and future directions in this field, which we expect to play a leading role in the landscape of the Future Internet. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The actor model defines a concurrent system where the individual unit of computation is the actor and communication between components is handled through a message passing interface. Pystation is an actor framework written in Python that implements a message-passing scheme where each actor has the ability to communicate with local actors or actors across a network. This paper describes some historical and background information on the actor model followed by details of its implementation and examples of use at a ground station. GNU Radio is utilized as the software for physical layer and signal processing, allowing for a highly robust and flexible ground station that can be altered without tedious hardware modifications. The purpose of this framework is to provide the software foundation to the Virginia Tech Ground Station (VTGS) in order to increase reliability and flexibility. The Virginia Tech Ground Station project is meant to serve as a ground station operations and communications sandbox for educational activities, such as student labs and space-based research projects.", "In this paper, needs of trusted IOT application are identified and a methodology is proposed to create a framework \"IoTEE\" for rapid prototyping of secure, trusted and commercial IOT applications in absence of hardware.

Furthermore, the methodology includes algorithm design for services like registration, authentication, authorization and secure communication in the proposed framework. Detailed operation sequence of the algorithms is also depicted to understand the overall switching scenario between trusted and non-trusted components of application. Finally, a dynamic deployment structure is created to enable and disable the trusted components in the framework.", "Despite successful pilots in developing countries, TVWS (Television White Spaces, unused portions of television broadcasting spectrum) has not gained the amount of attention that it deserves. One of the reasons is the lack of spectrum measurements that would convince the regulators about the abundance of idle spectrum. Spectrum measurements traditionally require expensive instruments and considerable operator's expertise. This has changed with the emergence of low cost spectrum analyzers and smartphones. In this paper we present RFTrack, a software suite that consists of an Android application and a TVWS analysis server. Together, they measure spectrum using a low-cost spectrum analyzer and geotag the data using the phone's internal GPS. The Android application is very easy to use and campaigns can be carried out by non-technical users. Once an Internet connection is available, the program sends data to the server that performs the required processes to present the results in an easy-to-understand way, also allowing for some user customization. The system has been used in eleven countries. We present the results from a measurement campaign in Costa Rica. We believe that this is a useful tool to demonstrate the existence of underutilized spectrum, especially in rural areas of developing countries.", "Industrial control systems have traditionally been built around dedicated wired solutions. The requirements of flexibility, mobility, and cost have created a strong push toward wireless solutions, preferably solutions requiring low power. Simultaneously, the increased need for interoperability and integration with the wider Internet made a transition to IP-based communication unavoidable. Following these trends, we survey 6TiSCH, the emerging family of standards for IP-based industrial communication over low-power and lossy networks. We describe the state of the standardization work, the major issues being discussed, and open questions recently identified. Based on extensive first-hand experience, we discuss challenges in implementation of this new wave of standards.

Not only are the 3D model collections of popular websites like Thingiverse. com growing, organizations such as the Smithsonian Institution and NASA have also recently begun to build collections of 3D models and make these openly accessible online. Yet, even with increased interest in 3D printing and 3D scanning technologies, little is known about the overall structure of the 3D models available on the internet. The paper aims to discuss this issue.", "Design/methodology/approach - To initiate this project, a list was built of 33 of the most widely used 3Dmodel websites on the internet. Freely downloadablemodels, as well as models available for purchase or as 3D printed objects were included in the list. Once the list of 33 websites was created, the data for each individual 3D model in the collections was manually assembled and recorded. The titles of the 3D models, keywords, subject headings, license information, and number of views and downloads were recorded, as this information was available. The data were gathered between January and May 2015, and compiled into a CSV database. To determine how online 3D model content relates to a variety of educational disciplines, relevant subject terms for a variety of educational disciples were extracted from the EBSCO database system. With this list of subject terms in hand, the keywords in the CSV database of model information were searched for each of the subject terms, with an automated process using a Perl script.", "Findings - There have been many teachers, professors, librarians and students who have purchased 3D printers with little or no 3D modelling skills. Without these skills the owners of these 3D printers are entirely reliant on the content created and freely shared by others to make use of their 3D printers.

The small fixed-wing UAV called Xiang Fei is developed independently by Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. The flight control system is designed based on an open-source autopilot (Pixhawk). Real-time kinematic (RTK) GPS is introduced due to its high accuracy. Some modifications on the longitudinal and lateral guidance laws are achieved to improve the flight control performance. Moreover, a data fusion based fault-tolerant control scheme is integrated in altitude control and speed control for altitude sensor failure and airspeed sensor failure, which are the common problems for small fixed-wing UAV. Finally, the real flight experiments are implemented to test the fault-tolerant control based autopilot of UAV.

Although there is not a unique definition of what a smart city is, it is generally accepted that \"smart\" urban policies refer to local governments' initiatives that use information and communication technologies in order to increase the quality of life of their inhabitants while contributing to a sustainable development. So far, \"smart city\" approaches have generally been related to top-down processes of technology diffusion. The purpose of this paper is to present a broader view on \"smart\" initiatives to analyze both top-down and bottom-up dynamics in a smart city. The authors argue that these two perspectives are complementary and its combination can reinforce the collaboration between different city stakeholders. Top-down and bottom-up initiatives are not opposed forces but, on the contrary, can have a synergistic effect on the innovation capacity of the city. Both perspectives are illustrated by providing examples of different \"smart\" aspects in the city of Barcelona: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data.", "Design/methodology/approach - To illustrate the arguments, the authors analyze the case of the city of Barcelona providing examples of top-down and bottom-up initiatives in four different smart city aspects: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data. The research method is based on a case study (Yin, 1984). The primary data consisted on interviews to city council representatives as well as managers of local public institutions, like economic development offices, and local organizations like for instance coworking spaces. The authors interviewed also specialists on the innovation history of the city in order to validate the data. In addition, the authors used secondary data such as reports on the 22@, and documentation on the Barcelona innovation policies, as well as doing a compilation of press articles and the online content of the institutional webpages. All together, the authors have followed a data triangulation strategy to seek data validation based on the cross-verification of the analyzed data sources.", "Findings - The analysis suggests that the top-down and bottom-up perspectives are complementary and their combination can reinforce the collaboration between different city stakeholders.

Both perspectives are illustrated by providing examples of different \"smart\" aspects in the city of Barcelona: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data.", "Research limitations/implications - Nevertheless, the analysis has its limitations. Even if the authors have emphasized the importance of the bottom-up initiatives, citizens do not have often the resources to act without governmental intervention. This is the case of services that require high-cost infrastructures or regulatory changes. Also, as it usually happens in the case of disruptive technology, it is hard for citizens to understand the possibilities of its use. In these cases, firms and institutions must play an important role in the first phases of the diffusion of innovations, by informing and incentivizing its use. It is also important to note that some of the emerging usages of technology are confronted to legal or regulatory issues. For instance, distributed and shared Wi-Fi networks might be in opposition to economic interests of internet providers, that often difficult its expansion. It is also the case of services of the sharing economy that represent a menace to established institutions (like the tensions between Uber and taxi companies, or Airbnb and hotels). In these cases, city halls like it is the case in Barcelona, tend to respond to these emergent uses of technology by regulating to ensure protection to existing corporate services.", "Practical implications - In conclusion, the transformational process that leads a city to become a smart city has to take in consideration the complexity and the plurality of the urban reality. Beyond considering citizens as being users, testers or consumers of technology, local administrations that are able to identify, nourish and integrate the emerging citizens' initiatives would contribute to the reinforcement of a smart city reality.", "Originality/value - The contribution of the paper is to go beyond the generalized technologic discourse around smart cities by adding the layer of the citizens' initiatives."], "Despite the virtual revolution, the mainstream academic community in most countries remains largely ignorant of the potential of web-based teaching resources and of the expansion of open source software, hardware and rapid prototyping. In the context of Biomedical Engineering (BME), where human safety and wellbeing is paramount, a high level of supervision and quality control is required before open source concepts can be embraced by universities and integrated into the curriculum. In the meantime, students, more than their teachers, have become attuned to continuous streams of digital information, and teaching methods need to adapt rapidly by giving them the skills to filter meaningful information and by supporting collaboration and co-construction of knowledge using open, cloud and crowd based technology. In this paper we present our experience in bringing these concepts to university education in Africa, as a way of enabling rapid development and self-sufficiency in health care.

As our health systems faced unexperienced pressure, being close to collapsing in some countries, and global supply chains failing to react immediately, makers started to prototype, locally produce and globally share designs of Open Source healthcare products, such as face shields and other medical supplies. Local collaboration with hospitals and healthcare professionals were established. These bottom-up initiatives from maker networks across the globe are showing us how responsible innovation is happening outside the constraints of profit-driven large industries. In this qualitative study we present five cases from a global network of makers that contributed to the production of personal protective equipment (PPE) and healthcare-related products. We draw our cases from the experiences made in Careables, a mixed community of people and organizations committed to the co-design and making of open, personalized healthcare for everyone.

Soil conditions can predict landslide threat, but the cost and complexity of sensing systems for documenting hazardous conditions across a heterogeneous spatial area prevent widespread utilization. The SitkaNet system is a low-cost, easier to install alternative that allows for numerous sites to be monitored with real-time reporting and expands the accessibility of data-driven landslide forecasting. Using a combination of industry-proven sensors and cheaper alternatives, each SitkaNet node can measure the rainfall, six soil moisture sensors at varying depths, water table, atmospheric pressure, humidity, and temperature at each site for less than one-fifth the cost of existing solutions (<$1000/node). The SitkaNet nodes transmit data wirelessly at five-minute intervals over LoRa network to an Ethernet connected hub instead of more traditional on-site cellular or satellite methods. The node electronics are packaged with 3D printed components in a small waterproof case mounted on a hand-driven well-point utilized for the water level measurement. Each node is intended for operation for more than six months on a lithium-ion battery pack: no solar panel is needed, so amenable to lowlight sites. The installation process is streamlined which allows for a node to be installed in less than a day compared to multi-day procedures required by other systems. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

However, integration of acoustic stations with sensors for logging of additional data, such as temperature and barometric pressure is rare. Separate environmental loggers often come at a cost of >US$100 whereas the same sensors for use with microprocessors come at a cost between US$ 1-15. The cost savings integration entails as well as the crucial need for the recording of some of these variables in acoustic studies mean that this is an important development avenue. Overcoming these issues is important to enable insights into the long-term dynamics of ecological systems and how they respond to changes in the environment at varying temporal scales and is especially important for studies involving species that are heavily influenced by microclimate. Here we present a hardware system for both acoustic and environmental data logging where the board design is released under a creative commons license. The system has been field tested in a tropical setting and is called the Kinabalu Recorder. The presented configuration came at a cost of <US$100 per station. This cost is for professional manufacture and assembly of the boards, temperature and barometric sensor, two batteries, waterproof housing and two 64 GB micro SD cards. The system has been extensively tested in a tropical setting along an altitude gradient and with over 1.3 TB of data (>2,000 hr of data with over 10 months in the field) presents a robust solution to long-term acoustic monitoring integrated with environmental data sensors.

This article describes the invention of a new testing system: the parametric open source cold-frame agrivoltaic system (POSCAS). POSCAS is an adapted gardening cold-frame used in cold climates as it acts as a small greenhouse for agricultural production. POSCAS is designed to test partially transparent solar photovoltaic (PV) modules targeting the agrivoltaic market. It can both function as a traditional cold frame, but it can also be automated to function as a full-service greenhouse. The integrated PV module roof can be used to power the controls or it can be attached to a microinverter to produce power. POSCAS can be placed in an experimental array for testing agricultural and power production. It can be easily adapted for any type of partially transparent PV module. An array of POSCAS systems allows for the testing of agrivoltaic impacts from the percent transparency of the modules by varying the thickness of a thin film PV material or the density of silicon-based cells, and various forms of optical enhancement, anti-reflection coatings and solar light spectral shifting materials in the back sheet.

Here we present the steps necessary to build a low-cost fixed-wing drone for environmental applications in large areas, along with instructions to increase the reliability of the system and testing its performance. Inspired by DIY (Do It Yourself) and open source models, this work prioritizes simplicity and accounts for cost-benefit for the researcher. The DIY fixed-wing drone developed has electric propulsion, can perform pre-programmed flight, can carry up to 500 g payload capacity with 65 minutes flight duration and flies at a maximum distance of 20 km. It is equipped with a RGB (Red, Green and Blue) sensor capable of obtaining 2.8 cm per pixel Ground Sample Distance (GSD) resolution at a constant altitude of 100 m above ground level (AGL). The total cost was $995 which is substantially less than the average value of similar commercial drones used in biodiversity studies. We performed 12 flight tests in auto mode using the developed model in protected areas in Brazil, obtaining RGB images that allowed us to identify deforestation spots smaller than 5 m(2) and medium-sized animals. Building DIY drones requires some technical knowledge and demands more time than buying a commercial ready-to-fly system, but as proved here, it can be less expensive, which is often crucial in conservation projects.", "This article introduces a new open-source dosimeter AIRDOS intended for measurements on board aircraft. In-flight measurement of a mixed radiation field is a challenging deal that requires a small low-power-consumption battery-operated lightweight device with long endurance. A new innovative electronic design with a silicon PIN diode used as a sensor is presented, including full description and manufacturing documentation. The device was verified by measurements and compared with reference dosimeters widely used in aircraft dosimetry, such as Liulin MDU and HAWK TEPC. A comparison of the measurements with a computation model CARI 7 was performed as well. All the comparisons yield positive results within known errors.

It examines the Ground Truth project, which addresses the Palestinian-Bedouin struggle for indigenous rights in the Naqab desert, in the southern region of Israel/Palestine. It focuses on the use of do-it-yourself (DIY) aerial photography with balloons and kites, alongside other collaborative practices, for mapping and visualizing Bedouin political and spatial claims. Against a backdrop of increasingly technologically savvy legal-professional cultures in human-rights organizations, this article proposes that a community-based DIY approach to truth making may challenge entrenched thresholds of participation and open opportunities for creating hybrid forums in the human-rights field.

To enable data-intensive network services and support advanced analytics, many network operators have proposed to integrate MEC systems with network function virtualization (NFV) consolidating virtual network functions (VNFs) and edge capabilities on a shared infrastructure. As of yet, this integration is not fully established, with various architectural issues currently open, even at standardization level. For instance, any update to VNFs deployed in a MEC system requires a time-consuming manual effort, which affects the overall infrastructure operations. To address these pitfalls, VNFs can be decomposed into microservices, which maintain their own states and exhibit different resource consumption requirements. This article presents an approach to integration that leverages serverless computing to merge MEC and NFV at the system level and to deploy VNFs on demand, by combining MEC functional blocks with an NFV orchestrator using a Kubernetes cluster. We further investigate whether the resource utilization of a MEC system can be improved by leveraging networked FPGA-enabled MEC servers, through an extension of the edge layer that takes advantage of available programmable hardware. We quantitatively evaluate and demonstrate the improvement of 75% end-to-end latency, 99.96% VNF execution time, 26.9% resource utilization, and 15.8% energy consumption in comparison with traditional baselines of cloud, edge, and serverless-edge test cases for a high-definition real-time video streaming application.", "Techno-optimism, or the enduring belief that technology use and production are promising for humanity, is bound up in past and ongoing ideals of modernity, progress, and \"development.\" As a particular form of hope and aspiration, techno-optimism is harnessed for nation-building and economic development projects that invest in the promise of scaling. This article demonstrates that this enduring techno-optimism requires various forms of entrepreneurial labor, and that the promise of scaling and technological progress together form a contemporary technique of governance.", "Fifth generation (5G) cellular networks will serve a wide variety of heterogeneous use cases, including mobile broadband users, ultra-low latency services and massively dense connectivity scenarios. The resulting diverse communication requirements will demand networking with unprecedented flexibility, not currently provided by the monolithic black-box approach of 4G cellular networks. The research community and an increasing number of standardization bodies and industry coalitions have recognized softwarization, virtualization, and disaggregation of networking functionalities as the key enablers of the needed shift to flexibility. Particularly, software-defined cellular networks are heralded as the prime technology to satisfy the new application-driven traffic requirements and to support the highly time-varying topology and interference dynamics, because of their openness through well-defined interfaces, and programmability, for swift and responsive network optimization. Leading the technological innovation in this direction, several 5G software-based projects and alliances have embraced the open source approach, making new libraries and frameworks available to the wireless community. This race to open source softwarization, however, has led to a deluge of solutions whose interoperability and interactions are often unclear. This article provides the first cohesive and exhaustive compendium of recent open source software and frameworks for 5G cellular networks, with a full stack and end-to-end perspective. We detail their capabilities and functionalities focusing on how their constituting elements fit the 5G ecosystem, and unravel the interactions among the surveyed solutions. Finally, we review hardware and testbeds on which these frameworks can run, and provide a critical perspective on the limitations of the state-of-the-art, as well as feasible directions toward fully open source, programmable 5G networks.", "5G is considered to be the technology that will accommodate the development and management of innovative services with stringent and diverse requirements from end users, calling for new business models from the industry. In this context, the development and efficient management of Network Services (NS) serving specific vertical industries and spanning across multiple administrative domains and heterogeneous infrastructures is challenging. The main challenges regard the efficient provision of NSs considering the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements per vertical industry along with the optimal usage of the allocated resources. Towards addressing these challenges, this paper details an innovative approach that we have developed for managing and orchestrating such NSs, called SONATA, and compare it with OSM and Cloudify, which are two of the most known open-source Management and Orchestration (MANO) frameworks. In addition to examining the supported orchestration mechanisms per MANO framework, an evaluation of main operational and functional KPIs is provided based on experimentation using a real testbed. The final aim is the identification of their strong and weak points, and the assessment of their suitability for serving diverse vertical industry needs, including of course the Internet of Things (IoT) service ecosystem.", "Accurate and stable time and frequency transfer (TFT) is typically required in distributed sensing. While this has historically been a limiting factor in the design of netted radars, the rise of modern TFT techniques has paved the way to nanosecond level time accuracy, absolute phase synchronization, and sub-Hertz frequency accuracy. In particular, netted systems composed of mobile nodes have benefited immensely from TFT based on global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). However, GNSS systems are liable to denial of service interruption. This article demonstrates the use of a fiber-optic White Rabbit (WR) network in an operational multistatic radar-NeXtRAD, and directly compares the results to one-way multichannel GPS disciplined oscillators acting under common-view TFT.", "In this paper we present two different, software and reconfigurable hardware, open architecture approaches to the PUMA 560 robot controller implementation, fully document them and provide the full design specification, software code and hardware description. Such solutions are necessary in today's robotics and industry: deprecated old control units render robotic installations useless and allow no upgrades, advancements, or innovation in an inherently innovative ecosystem. For the sake of simplicity, just the first robot axis is considered. The first approach described is a PC solution with data acquisition I/O board (Humusoft MF634). This board is supported with Matlab Real-Time Windows Toolbox for real-time applications and thus whole controller was designed in Matlab environment. The second approach is a robot controller developed on field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) board. The complexity of FPGA design can be overcome by using a third party software package, such as self-developed Matlab FPGA Real Time Toolbox. In both cases, parameters of motion controller are calculated by using simulation of the PUMA 560 robot first axis motion. Simulations were conducted in Matlab/Simulink using Robotics Toolbox.", "Open Science Hardware (OScH) refers to open-source alternatives for proprietary scientific equipment. While the OScH movement aims to reduce barriers for scientific experimentation both in and beyond professional labs, disseminating OScH for widespread adoption proves to be challenging in practice. To this end, we examined real-world practices related to the dissemination of OScH through a two-part study. First, we developed an open science hardware, a DIY incubator, and disseminated it through the Instructables website and maker workshops. In parallel, we interviewed eight open science hardware practitioners from different parts of the world. Insights from interviews together with our own self-reflections revealed how different OScH dissemination modalities serve unique purposes. Our findings also reveal several challenges for widespread adoption of OScH and the importance of collaborations between OScH developers. We conclude by discussing the opportunities for HCI to lower barriers for customization, support internationalization of OScH, and scaffold proactive distributed collaborations between developers and users.", "Purpose Maternal mortality is an acute problem for many countries around the world, particularly those at the bottom of the pyramid (BoP). Most remote locations in these underdeveloped nations, for instance, in Africa, have to cope with the problem of interrupted electricity supply making healthcare practitioners often experience a helpless compulsion to compromise in providing quality medical attention, especially during childbirth. Along with many public, private and nongovernment initiatives, WE CARE Solar (hereafter WCS) - a social innovation venture comes with an idea of developing portable solar suitcases to respond to this intransigent problem. Design/methodology/approach This paper introduces a social enterprise that established its operation in Africa and so far has served in more than 30 similarly impoverished economies. Data was collected, analyzed using documentary research method. The authors have also collected and correlated the statements from the founder of WCS to complement the authors' findings. With this paper, the authors intend to establish the type of innovation tools that are needed to provide value with a social innovation initiative in the health sector in the least developed country perspective. To facilitate better social outcomes and to ensure greater good, innovation requires to be accompanied by stakeholders' involvement. Findings The findings indicate that WE CARE Solar has a positive social contribution toward ensuring safe motherhood and childbirth in underdeveloped countries by providing access to reliable solar power sources. The six-step social innovation process can be adopted by other social ventures to propose innovative solutions to social needs. Analyzing WCS's service delivery from the perspective of the 4As framework and value co-creation model, it is suggested that sustainable social change can be established with value co-creation through community engagement with multiple stakeholders. Research limitations/implications This research was solely focused on one organization alone. Future research could look into the model to ascertain its acceptability in similar social innovation in healthcare initiatives. Originality/value This paper attempts to address a gap in social innovation in healthcare and its adaptability using the 4As framework with the value co-creation model. The authors propose this model from the data accumulated throughout the research, which could also serve to assist organizations looking for scalable and sustainable change.", "The Internet of Things is one of the ideas that has become increasingly relevant in recent years. It involves connecting things to the Internet in order to retrieve information from them at any time and from anywhere. In the Internet of Things, sensor networks that exchange information wirelessly via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee or RF are common. In this sense, our paper presents a way in which each classroom control is accessed through Near Field Communication (NFC) and the information is shared via radio frequency. These data are published on the Web and could easily be used for building applications from the data collected. As a result, our application collects information from the classroom to create a control classroom tool that displays access to and the status of all the classrooms graphically and also connects this data with social networks.", "Remote laboratories are nowadays essential in distance learning, as our case is, since students are not able to use face-to-face traditional laboratories. These remote laboratories can be employed by teacher within virtual classrooms, so that students can carry out their on-line experiments from anywhere and at anytime. The main drawback of these kinds of laboratories is their cost; this is more noticeable in the field of renewable energy. For this reason, this work proposes the use of low-cost remote laboratories, aimed at the study of solar and wind renewable energy. The described remote laboratory is based on using the popular robotic kit, named Lego Mindstorms NXT v2.0. robotic kit, which allows teachers to have flexibility when designing the laboratory and adapt it to the educational necessities of a course. The programming of these laboratories has been performed by using RESTful web services with LabVIEW, a novel approach that enables users the creation of multiplatform laboratories.", "Via a close navigation of a Google Street View (GSV) scene in Oslo, this article investigates the role the photographic image plays in what has come to be known as locative media' - an entire range of image software that runs on mobile devices using GPS signals to locate the user, and that emerged after the United States government decided to end the intentional degradation of the public GPS signal in 2001, fostering the development of navigable photo-maps such as GSV, photo-synths and other location-based image applications such as Augmented Reality. The authors first address the temporal discontinuities and gaps of the GSV database, which the user navigates as a spatially continuous image. Second, they show that the city is experienced as one and the same data space, simultaneously traversed both on-site and on-screen. Third, they critically interrogate the navigability of the GSV image afforded by real-time data processing based on mutual data exchanges between user location, hardware, software, network and database. They argue that the GSV image is what Harun Farocki, in an article on cybernetic warfare, has called an operative image', an image that no longer represents an object but is part of an operation. In fact, the users' trajectories feeding back into the database initiate a reverse operativity, which proves to be the more problematic side of ubiquitous locative media applications such as GSV.", "The Thymio II robot was designed to be used by teachers in their classrooms for a wide range of activities and at all levels of the curriculum, from very young children to the end of high school. Although the educationally oriented design of this innovative robot was successful and made it possible to distribute more than 800 Thymio robots in schools with a large majority in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, it was not sufficient to significantly raise the number of teachers using robot technology in their teaching after three years of commercialization. After an introduction and a first section on the design of this educational robot, this paper presents some results of a sociological analysis of the benefits and blockages identified by teachers in using robots, or not, with their pupils.", "This paper presents the development of a low cost mobile manipulator called the CAIRO-MM-1 for the purpose of research and education.

CAIRO-MM-1 features the servomotors as the arm actuators and DC motors for the tracks. The sensors include the wheel encoders and the inertia measurement unit to aid the autonomous navigation of the mobile platform. The software, as well as its architecture is described. The software modules are developed using the .NET framework on the Windows 8 platform. In its experiments, CAIRO-MM-1 is tested for its functional and behavioral features and results show that CAIRO-MM-1 is now suitable for research and educational purposes.", "The consumer market is continuously pushing for smarter, faster, more durable and cheaper products with ever more complex and sophisticated functionality. Other fields such as safety-critical and dependable applications are not unaware of these requirements, and even impose others (e.g. certification). In the current multi-core era, industry and research entities are facing the important challenge of fulfilling all these requirements, which often impose the necessity for integrating components with different levels of dependability in a single hardware platform. In this scenario, new concerns appear with respect to safety certification of the resulting mixed-criticality systems (e.g. temporal and spatial isolation). This article describes the research effort that is being conducted within the FP7 MultiPARTES project, which is one of the initiatives launched by the European Commission to explore new solutions for developing certifiable mixed-criticality systems using heterogeneous multi-cores. The article explains the proposed development toolset for such systems, presents a proof-of-concept implementation and shows its applicability in a real-world application that needs to be certified, namely a wind-power turbine.

However, traditional approaches based on manual configuration of proprietary devices are cumbersome and error-prone, and they cannot fully utilize the capability of physical network infrastructure. Recently, software-defined networking (SDN) has been touted as one of the most promising solutions for future Internet. SDN is characterized by its two distinguished features, including decoupling the control plane from the data plane and providing programmability for network application development. As a result, SDN is positioned to provide more efficient configuration, better performance, and higher flexibility to accommodate innovative network designs. This paper surveys latest developments in this active research area of SDN. We first present a generally accepted definition for SDN with the aforementioned two characteristic features and potential benefits of SDN. We then dwell on its three-layer architecture, including an infrastructure layer, a control layer, and an application layer, and substantiate each layer with existing research efforts and its related research areas. We follow that with an overview of the de facto SDN implementation (i.e., OpenFlow). Finally, we conclude this survey paper with some suggested open research challenges.", "Critical approaches to the smart city concept are used to begin highlighting the promises of makerspaces, that is to say, those emerging urban sites that promote sharing practices; exercise community-based forms of governance; and utilize local manufacturing technologies. A bird's-eye-view of the history of makerspaces is provided tracing their roots back to the hacker movement. Drawing from secondary sources, their community-building, learning and innovation potential is briefly discussed. Makerspaces, this essay argues, can serve as hubs and vehicles for citizen-driven transformation and, thus, play a key part in a more inclusive, participatory and commons-oriented vision of the smart city.

All rights reserved.", "The AXIOM platform is built with, in mind, the possibility of executing an application not only on a single board but also, in a distributed fashion, on multiple boards. While this is a classic problem with some solutions in the case of no constraints, it becomes interesting for embedded computing and cyber-physical systems where we aim to accelerate applications while maintaining energy efficency and also easy programmability. Currently, the AXIOM platform consists of a custom board based on the Xilinx Zynq Ultrascale+ ZU9EG which incorporates the largest FPGA avaialable on that System-on-Chip at the moment, four 64-bit ARM cores and two 32-bit ARM cores, up to 32GiB of main memory and several 12.5Gbitis tranceivers. We relyed on this hardware to develop our novel concept, which exploitsdataflow execution in multiple ways for programs that are written in an OpenMP extension, known as OmpSs. A key aspect relates to the adopted memory consistency model, which allows the programmer to focus on aspects other than taking care of the communication among nodes. The lower level of our communication stack relies on a fast interconnect based on inexpensive USB-C type connectors rather than on other proprietary interfaces. The reconfigurable logic provides a complete Network Interface Card (NIC) to allow fast routing of the data and code of the system. We envision many applications for this platform although we are currently focused on developing two basic scenarios based on the Smart-Home and on Smart-Videosurveillance. Our initial results confirm good scalability of the platform and a speed-up compared to other programming models such as Cilk and OpenMPI.", "This paper suggests an extended product data model that integrates product design and manufacturing data to support personal manufacturing based on 3D printing services. To produce highly customized products with limited resources, personal manufacturers require data management tools for integrated product design and manufacturing. However, the current separated and dedicated design and manufacturing information systems for mass production cannot satisfy the requirements of personal manufacturing. To solve this problem, this study introduces an extended product data model that has data objects for bills of processes (BOP), customer orders and manufacturing operation linked to 3D printing services through Internet of things (IOTs) technologies. The extended product data model can support product design, process planning, production planning, and execution of manufacturing operation in a unified single user environment. To demonstrate the applicability of the model, this study implemented it as a prototype product data management (PDM) system and applied the system to an example product development.", "This article describes a platform of acquisition, processing and visualization of the behavior for isolated solar systems called SOLAR MANAGER.

It can overcome the shortcomings of poor flexibility and versatility of traditional data acquisition monitoring system. The Data Acquisition System (DAS) has been employed to collect the current data of a single-phase induction motor through USB communication. The prototype developed for experiment shows that data collection and monitoring system has features of being low cost, easy to use and wide range of application and has very important application for collection and monitoring data in industrial areas and laboratories. This cost-effective hardware platform along with adequate data processing capability can be used to monitor motors from abnormalities.", "Estimating the input-output behavior of low voltage powerline channels for indoor high speed data communications requires the availability of proper wideband channel sounding tools. In fact, the properties of real world powerline channels are substantially different from those commonly exhibited by their wireless counterparts, so that standard methods for wireless channel sounding cannot be adapted to a powerline scenario. In this paper, after providing some general design guidelines for powerline channel sounding, a detailed description of a FPGA-based implementation of a wideband powerline channel sounder is provided. Such a tool is based on low cost hardware and is flexible, since it can be easily customized to user needs using a set of simple graphical user interfaces. Some of its specific applications, namely the estimation of the time-varying transfer function of an indoor powerline channel and the evaluation of the power spectral density of the noise affecting it, are illustrated to show the potentialities of the developed equipment.", "This paper proposes two methods for UAV translational velocity estimation based on onboard sensing only. Spherical image measurements provided by a single onboard camera along with IMU data consist the main information feeding the estimators. The first algorithm consists of a nonlinear observer, designed using Lyapunov synthesis, while the second is based on the Unscented Kalman filtering technique. Differently with respect to existing approaches, the velocity is directly estimated from the onboard image without the need to fully estimate the vehicle 3D pose. The low computational requirement makes the proposed techniques suitable for applications where the execution time is of prominent importance even if no powerful hardware is available, as it is the case with UAV systems. Experimental results validate the algorithms, and this with the use of only four image features.", "We reflect on our ongoing series of DIY Prosthetics Workshops intended to engage the public in critical discourse about technology and human augmentation through engagement with prosthetics.

The concept collective action framing' is borrowed from social movement theory to describe how hackers have appropriated notions of a post-industrial, information society in their struggles against intellectual property laws and state censorship. Hackers have reintroduced an element of conflict and antagonism into otherwise politically innocuous visions of post-industrialism. This residual of antagonism can be traced back to the roots of the post-industrial myth in Marxist, historical materialist theory. By exploring these origins, the article proceeds to compare the hopes invested by hackers in the emancipatory force of information technology with the earlier beliefs of labour movements that the forces of history were on their side. Building on this comparison it is argued that technological determinism does not always lead to political resignation, but can also serve as a foundation for collective action.", "Short Description-The aim of this paper is to introduce the use of Arduino, an established tool in the development of applications and deployment of educational content, as of a course related to the introduction to robotics. Robotics requires several skills and competencies that can be easily developed with tools like Arduino. These skills and competencies are related to the areas of knowledge used for the development of robotic applications, such as computer science, electricity, electronics and mechanics. Throughout this paper we present Arduino, the resources used for the deployment of the course and the results obtained from the educational experiences carried out. The results of the educational robotics course demonstrate how children with previous experience in Scratch programming, skills and competencies with simple Crumble-based robots can continue the learning process through classroom experiences using Arduino. In this way, students can improve skills and competencies already worked with tools such as Scratch and Crumble. Another important observation from the results is that it is important to adapt the difficulty of the content to each child. Finally, it is important to combine theory and practice to include fun and intertwined tasks with the challenges of applying theory to problem solving.", "3D printing content, which has been increasingly shared through the open communities over the last decade, has both aesthetic and functional features. There has been growing concern over whether current licensing policies provide sufficient options for contributors to the open communities. To suggest a direction for alternative license options, it is necessary to understand contributors' license preferences for sharing diverse 3D printing content. Using a logit model based on information collected from Thingiverse, this study investigates the relationship between the various features of 3D printing content and contributors' choices among the Creative Commons licenses currently available. The result indicates that preferences are clearly distinguished by the features of the content, whether the content is functional or non-functional in nature. However, there is no significant difference, in terms of license choice, for the numerous 3D printing content items that contain both functional and non-functional features. This result implies that there is a deficiency in the current licenses that cover 3D printing content. Implications for future license policies are discussed.", "Low-cost video surveillance systems are attractive for Smart Home applications (especially in emerging economies). Those systems use the flexibility of the Internet of Things to operate the video camera only when an intrusion is detected. We are the only ones that focus on the design of protocols based on intelligent agents to communicate the video of an intrusion in real time to the guards by wireless or mobile networks. The goal is to communicate, in real time, the video to the guards who can be moving towards the smart home. However, this communication suffers from sporadic disruptions that difficults the control and drastically reduces user satisfaction and operativity of the system. In a novel way, we have designed a generic software architecture based on design patterns that can be adapted to any hardware in a simple way. The implanted hardware is of very low economic cost; the software frameworks are free. In the experimental tests we have shown that it is possible to communicate to the moving guard, intrusion notifications (by e-mail and by instant messaging), and the first video frames in less than 20 s. In addition, we automatically recovered the frames of video lost in the disruptions in a transparent way to the user, we supported vertical handover processes and we could save energy of the smartphone's battery. However, the most important thing was that the high satisfaction of the people who have used the system.", "Microplate readers are foundational instruments in experimental biology and bioengineering that enable multiplexed spectrophotometric measurements. To enhance their accessibility, we here report the design, construction, validation, and benchmarking of an open-source microplate reader. The system features full-spectrum absorbance and fluorescence emission detection, in situ optogenetic stimulation, and stand-alone touch screen programming of automated assay protocols. The total system costs less than $3500, a fraction of the cost of commercial plate readers, and can detect the fluorescence of common dyes at concentrations as low as, similar to 10 nM. Functional capabilities were demonstrated in the context of synthetic biology, optogenetics, and photosensory biology: by steady-state measurements of ligand-induced reporter gene expression in a model of bacterial quorum sensing and by flavin photocycling kinetic measurements of a LOV (light-oxygen-voltage) domain photoreceptor used for optogenetic transcriptional activation. Fully detailed guides for assembling the device and automating it using the custom Python-based API (Application Program Interface) are provided.

Previously, these instruments have been used at continental scales by the GLOBE program, but this extension is already covered by more expensive and higher-precision instruments of the AERONET global network. For this we built an open source two-channeled LED-based Sun photometer based on previous developments, with improvements in the hardware, software, and modifications on the calibration procedure. Among these we highlight the use of MODTRAN to characterize the effect introduced by using LED sensors in the AOT retrieval, an open design available for the scientific community and a calibration procedure that takes advantage of a CIMEL Sun photometer located within the city, enables the intercomparison of several LED Sun photometers with a common reference. We estimated the root-mean-square error in the AOT retrieved by the prototypes as 0.006 at the 564nm and 0.009 at the 408nm. This error is way under the magnitude of the AOT daily cycle variability measured by us in our campaigns, even for distances closer than 15km. In addition to inner city campaigns, we also show aerosol-tracing applications by measuring AOT variations from the city of Santiago to the Andes glaciers. Measuring AOT at high spatial resolution in urban areas can improve our understanding of urban scale aerosol circulation, providing information for solar energy planning, health policies, and climatological studies, among others.", "This paper presents a system for remote monitoring of turbidity data that can detect light intensity and temperature using a microcontroller and the Internet of Things.

This system will allow educators and students to monitor chemical experiments in real-time through a web browser. Changes in turbidity and signal processing associated with a light dependent resistor are stored locally on the microcontroller and transmitted wirelessly via a WiFi-based connection to a cloud-based server.

In this way, the proposed instrument overcomes the state-of-the art issues of comfort, wearability, signal quality, and feasibility on limited resources devices (e.g., tablets or smartphones) of BCI applications. The accuracy results of the instrument prototype, assessed in an experimental campaign on human subjects in laboratory, foster its application in wearable biomedical devices.", "Agricultural research involves study of the complex soil-plant-atmosphere-water system, and data relating to this system must be collected under often-harsh outdoor conditions in agricultural environments. Rapid advancements in electronic technologies in the last few decades, as well as more recent widespread proliferation and adoption of electronic sensing and communications, have created many options to address the needs of professional, as well as amateur, researchers. In this study, an agricultural research project was undertaken to collect data and examine the effects of different agronomic practices on yield, with the objectives being to develop a monitoring system to measure soil moisture and temperature conditions in field plots and to upload the data to an internet website. The developed system included sensor nodes consisting of sensors and electronic circuitry to read and transmit sensor data via radio and a cellular gateway to receive node data and forward the data to an internet website via cellular infrastructure. Microcontroller programs were written to control the nodes and gateway, and an internet website was configured to receive and display sensor data. The battery-powered sensor nodes cost $170 each, including electronic circuitry and sensors, and they were operated throughout the cropping season with little maintenance on a single set of batteries. The solar-powered gateway cost $163 to fabricate, plus an additional cost of $2 per month for cellular network access. Wireless and cellular data transmissions were reliable, successfully transferring 95% of sensor data to the internet website. Application of open-source hardware, wireless data transfer, and internet-based data access therefore offers many options and advantages for agricultural sensing and monitoring efforts.", "This paper proposes a photovoltaic (PV) model for the design of PV systems with a simple MPPT to achieve high efficiency, faster response and low cost. First, a PV panel model is developed using SPICE code in Proteus tool. The verification and the validation are performed via an experimental test bench. Afterwards, a new modified Incremental Conductance (INC) algorithm is introduced. The proposed algorithm avoids the high number of the mathematical divisions used in the conventional INC. Both methods are implemented in the low-cost Arduino Uno board using the simulated PV panel model. The results show that the modified method presents good performances regarding response time (0.1 s), steady-state oscillation, and efficiency (98.5%). To validate the proposed system, a hardware testbench is implemented using the low-cost ATMega328 microcontroller in the Arduino Uno board. Substantial cost reduction has been attained proving the financial competitiveness of the proposed controller. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Today, robotics training tools are raised with the aim of promoting innovation and motivation of students during the learning process. Robots are becoming more and more common in our daily lives; therefore, it is important to integrate robots into all levels of our society. This document presents a workshop that focuses on two main objectives. The first is to make an event to promote Crumble locally. On the other hand, the aim of this event is to present a robotic teaching tool so that people can take their first steps in the world of robotics. This workshop is aimed at those children and adults who want to discover the possibilities that Crumble brings in the introduction to robotics. An introduction to Crumble in the context of educational robotics is developed throughout this workshop.", "The paper presents a monitoring system developed for an energy conversion system based on the sun and known as thermophotovoltaic panel (PVT).

Using a systematisation that considers environmental effects of information and communication technologies as direct, indirect and structural, this article discerns the future socio-environmental scenarios indicative of each value model. We argue that the two value models share the same type of direct environmental effects associated with a similar technological infrastructure; however, their indirect effects differ in prospects of consumer behaviour, environmental awareness and product design. Likewise the difference in structural effects is significant as the NFCC is based on profit maximisation and an accumulation of capital, whereas the HMPP is agnostic to growth and oriented towards the commons. Hence, the latter is considered as the socio-environmentally auspicious choice, but comes not without transitional challenges of its own. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) many-core architectures have been adopted for multimedia and signal processing applications with massive amounts of data parallelism where both performance and flexible programmability are important metrics. However, this class of processors has faced many challenges due to its increasing fabrication cost and design complexity. Moreover, the increasing gap between design productivity and chip complexity requires new design methods. Nowadays, the recent evolution of silicon integration technology, on the one hand, and the wide usage of reusable Intellectual Property (IP) cores and FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays), on the other hand, are attractive solutions to meet these challenges and reduce the time-to-market. The objective of this work is to study the performances of massively parallel SIMD on-chip architectures with current design methodologies based on recent integration technologies. Flexibility offered by these new design tools allows design space exploration to search for the most effective implementations. This work introduces an IP-based design methodology for easy building configurable and flexible massively parallel SIMD processing on FPGA platforms. The proposed approach allows implementing a generic parallel architecture based on IP assembly that can be tailored in order to better satisfy the requirements of highly-demanding applications.

Load balancing schemes based on flow hashing, e.g., ECMP, cause congestion when hash collisions occur and can perform poorly in asymmetric topologies. Recent proposals to load balance the network require centralized traffic engineering, multipath-aware transport, or expensive specialized hardware. We propose a mechanism that avoids these limitations by (i) pushing load-balancing functionality into the soft network edge (e.g., virtual switches) such that no changes are required in the transport layer, customer VMs, or networking hardware, and (ii) load balancing on fine-grained, near-uniform units of data (flowcells) that fit within end-host segment offload optimizations used to support fast networking speeds. We design and implement such a soft-edge load balancing scheme, called Presto, and evaluate it on a 10 Gbps physical testbed. We demonstrate the computational impact of packet reordering on receivers and propose a mechanism to handle reordering in the TCP receive offload functionality. Presto's performance closely tracks that of a single, non-blocking switch over many workloads and is adaptive to failures and topology asymmetry.", "Software defined networking (SDN) achieves network routing management with logically centralized control software that decouples the network data plane from the control plane.

The CopterSonde is an ambitious attempt by the Center for Autonomous Sensing and Sampling to address the challenge of filling the observational gap present in the lower atmosphere among the currently used meteorological instruments such as towers and radiosondes. The CopterSonde is a unique and highly flexible platform for in situ atmospheric boundary layer measurements with high spatial and temporal resolution, suitable for meteorological applications and research. Custom autopilot algorithms and hardware features were developed as solutions to problems identified throughout several field experiments carried out since 2017. In these field experiments, the CopterSonde has been proven capable of safely operating at wind speeds up to 22ms(-1), flying at 3050m above mean sea level, and operating in extreme temperatures: nearly -20 degrees C in Finland and 40 degrees C in Oklahoma, United States. Leveraging the open-source ArduPilot autopilot code has allowed for seamless integration of custom functions and protocols for the acquisition, storage, and distribution of atmospheric data alongside the flight control data. This led to the development of features such as the \"wind vane mode\" algorithm, which commands the CopterSonde to always face into the wind. It also inspired the design of an asymmetric airframe for the CopterSonde, which is shown to provide more suitable locations for weather sensor placement, in addition to allowing for improvements in the overall aerodynamic characteristics of the CopterSonde. Moreover, it has also allowed the team to design and create a modular shell where the sensor package is attached and which can run independently of the Copter-Sonde's main body.

In situ measured salinity, temperature and sea-level data, together with Sea Surface Temperature (SST) obtained from GHRSST project, enabled to investigate the seasonal and inter-annual variability of the hydrography of the bay. Inhambane Bay is a bifurcated two-channel bar-built estuary with an along-coast channel of 30.5 km and a secondary channel of 12.5 km. In terms of tidal classification, Inhambane Bay is classified into the meso-tidal category forced by semi-diurnal tides with a Form Number equal to 0.04. The maximum observed tidal range is similar to 3.41 m, with mean spring and neap tidal ranges of similar to 2.61 m and similar to 1.34 m, respectively. Also, the mean salinity profiles are practically uniform (well-mixed estuary) due to the strong tidal forcing being the Richardson Estuarine number below 0.08. The flushing time is estimated between 1 and 3 days. The characterization presented in this research is novel in the region and involves for the first time systematic in situ observations.

Advancing the different technological aspects of these solutions requires effective IoT implementations and experimentations. This is widely addressed following low-cost and scalable methods such as analytical modeling and simulation. However, such methods are limited in capturing physical characteristics and network conditions in a realistic manner.

Enabling machine learning algorithms to run on resource-constrained hardware, typically on low-power smart devices, is challenging in terms of hardware (optimized and energy-efficient integrated circuits), algorithmic, and firmware implementations. This article presents a FANN-on-MCU, an open-source toolkit built upon the fast artificial neural network (FANN) library to run lightweight and energy-efficient neural networks on microcontrollers based on both the ARM Cortex-M series and the novel RISC-V-based parallel ultralow-power (PULP) platform. The toolkit takes multilayer perceptrons trained with FANN and generates code targeted to low-power microcontrollers. This article also presents detailed analyses of energy efficiency across the different cores, and the optimizations to handle different network sizes. Moreover, it provides a detailed analysis of parallel speedups and degradations due to parallelization overhead and memory transfers. Further evaluations include experimental results for three different applications using a self-sustainable wearable multisensor bracelet. The experimental results show a measured latency in the order of only a few microseconds and power consumption of a few milliwatts while keeping the memory requirements below the limitations of the targeted microcontrollers.

They were employed to analyze the antioxidant capacity of several tea infusions by profiting from the Folin-Ciocalteu assay. A performance comparable with that displayed by research-grade spectrophotometers indicates that these easy-to-operate and low-cost devices can provide accurate and precise results, thus demonstrating that highly-sensitive optical instrumentations, useful not only in research and education environments but also in resource-limited settings, can be readily constructed by a DIY (Do-It-Yourself) approach.", "Intelligent agriculture in general, but especially when agricultural fields are very heterogeneous, requires a large number of sensors in order to obtain an effective control and thus increase productivity. This need becomes more evident in vineyards on the farms of the demarcated Douro region due to the specificities of the territory and the vineyards themselves. Thus, it is necessary to have low cost sensors which are, essentially, easy to install and maintain. In the present work, a node with these characteristics was developed, which, in addition, is low consumption and communicates wirelessly through a Long Rang Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) network. To obtain an easy installation, a library of clusters was created for the LoRaWAN network and dedicated to sensors used in agriculture, especially those using an asynchronous serial protocol for intelligent sensors. Three nodes were developed and tested with sensors used in agriculture to measure several environmental parameters (soil and air temperature; wind speed, gust and direction; soil water content, water tension and electrical conductivity; solar radiation; precipitation; atmospheric and vapor pressure; relative humidity; and lightning strikes count). The three nodes send data to a server through an existing gateway on the farm. The data are decoded and sent to an Internet-of-Things analytics platform where it is aggregated, viewed and analyzed. Samples of the data collected are presented. The developed nodes are of small dimensions (85x65x35mm), thus making them easy to handle and install. Energy consumption depends on the distance to the gateway, and the number and type of sensors connected to each node. In the implemented cases, the maximum consumption was approximate to 400 mu A. The development of a cluster based library makes the node plug-and-play. The developed nodes will be a great step forward for the use of wireless sensors in smart agriculture in Douro vineyards.", "Maker communities have been widely popularized during the last decade throughout the development of numerous shared spaces in the form of makerspaces, fab labs and hackerspaces across the globe.

Irradiated modified GNPs, such as streptavidin-conjugated GNPs, are embedded in tBLMs containing target molecules, such as biotin. By using this approach, the heat transfer processes between irradiated GNPs and model bilayer lipid membrane with entities of interest are mediated by a horizontally focused laser beam. The thermal predictive computational model is used to confirm the electrochemically induced conductance changes in the tBLMs. Under the specific conditions used, detecting heat pulses required specific attachment of the gold nanoparticles to the membrane surface, while unbound gold nanoparticles failed to elicit a measurable response.

OES minimize development cost and enhance portability while addressing widely known shortcomings of their proprietary counterparts. These shortcomings include the black box method of distribution which hinders integration to more complex systems. However, OES are highly dependent on the compatibility of each software components and essential benchmarking is required to ensure that the system can satisfy hard real-time constraints. To address these issues and the notion that OES will find broader distributed control applications, we provide detailed procedures in realizing OES based on an open source real-time operating system on various low-cost open embedded platforms. Their performance was evaluated and compared in terms of periodicity and schedulability, task synchronization, and interrupt response time, which are crucial metrics to determine stability and reliability of real-time controllers.

Most studies on fault detection in swarm robotics have been conducted exclusively in simulation, and they have focused on a single type of fault or a specific task. In a series of previous studies, we have developed a robust fault-detection approach in which robots in a swarm learn to distinguish between normal and faulty behaviors online. In this paper, we assess the performance of our fault-detection approach on a swarm of seven physical mobile robots. We experiment with three classic swarm robotics tasks and consider several types of faults in both sensors and actuators. Experimental results show that the robots are able to reliably detect the presence of hardware faults in one another even when the swarm behavior is changed during operation.

The massive field data aggregation of distributed administered IoT devices allows new insights and actionable information for dynamic intelligent decision-making. In such distributed environments, data integrity, referring to reliability and consistency, is deemed insufficient and requires immediate facilitation. In this article, we introduce a distributed ledger (DLT)-based system for ensuring IoT data integrity which securely processes the aggregated field data. Its uniqueness lies in the embedded use of IOTA's ledger, called \"The Tangle\", used to transmit and store the data.

Material and methods: The study demonstrates the first deployment of the Anser electromagnetic (EM) tracking system with the CustusX image-guided interventional research platform to navigate using an endobronchial catheter to injected tumour targets. Live animal investigations validated the deployment and targeting of peripheral tumour models using an innovative tumour marking routine. Results: Novel tumour model deployment was successfully achieved at all eight target sites across two live animal investigations without pneumothorax. Virtual bronchoscopy with tracking successfully guided the tracked catheter to 2?12?mm from the target tumour site. Deployment of a novel marker was achieved at all eight sites providing a reliable measure of targeting accuracy. Targeting accuracy within 10?mm was achieved in 7/8 sites and in all cases, the virtual target distance at marker deployment was within the range subsequently measured with x-ray.

Through a critical review of research and practices of makerspaces in the U.S., Singapore, China and Ghana, this paper explores the respective national discourses surrounding the maker movement and maker education. By revealing some of the ways that the values have been embraced, reinterpreted, remixed or rejected as the movement has gained global momentum, this paper intends to establish a greater appreciation for the diversity and complexity of the maker movement and maker education in the global context. Ultimately, this complex, multifaceted remixing reveals a deeper understanding of why the movement has been or may be embraced by diverse nations across the globe.", "A suitable and quick determination of air quality allows the population to be alerted with respect to high concentrations of pollutants. Recent advances in computer science have led to the development of a high number of low-cost sensors, improving the spatial and temporal resolution of air quality data while increasing the effectiveness of risk assessment. The main objective of this work is to perform a validation of a particulate matter (PM) sensor (HM-3301) in indoor and outdoor environments to study PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations. To date, this sensor has not been evaluated in real-world situations, and its data quality has not been documented.

The low-cost sensor is highly correlated with the reference measure (R-2 greater than 0.70), especially for PM2.5, with a very high accuracy value. In addition, there is a positive relationship between the two measurements, which can be appropriately fitted through the Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing model.", "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) demonstrate excellent manoeuvrability in cluttered environments, which makes them a suitable platform as a data collection and parcel delivering system.

To reduce the complexity, a method for controlling packet processing in NPs by using PPCs is proposed. By means of this method, complex control messages are partially processed and divided into simplified control packets by a CPU outside the NP chip, and these packets are sent to a control-processing PPC. The control-processing PPC controls data-processing PPCs by using data-exchange mechanisms, such as a shared memory or an on-chip network, which are more uniform and simpler than those between a CPC and PPCs. This control method is applied to a virtual-link control-processing task and packet-processing tasks in a network node with a virtualization function. Both tasks are described by a hardware-independent high-level language called \"Phonepl,\" and communication between the PPCs is programmed following normal and uniform shared-memory semantics.

In 2011, the Humanitarian Initiatives Committee (HIC) of IEEE Region 7 organized a student design competition [1] with the specific objective of understanding the design process of HT \"Solutions\" to be made available as open source. The 2011 competition was an initial effort to understand open source licensing, open source hardware and the open source development model. Adoption of the open source development model was a stated objective of IEEE's Humanitarian technology Challenge (HTC) [2]. The HIC held a student paper competition in 2013. The goal of the 2013 competition was to nurture the growing interest in Humanitarian Technology in Region 7; to address HIC's concerns from the 2011 competition, more effort was focused in the paper review process for the 2013 competition and standard IEEE peer-review tools and processes were used. This document presents in Section III the lessons learned during these two competitions, and proposes in section IV a Product Lifecycle Management framework for the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) of OSI development that leverages IEEE's peer-review process.", "This article explores the changing relationship between the academy and new public formations of scientific research, which we term \"civic technoscience.\" Civic technoscience leverages tactics seen in critical making communities to question and transform how and who can make credible and actionable knowledge. A comparison of two case studies is used. The first is a grassroots mapping process that allows communities to generate high-quality aerial imagery. The second is an academic-led project using environmental sensors to engage disparate audiences in scientific practice. These two projects were found to differ in their ability to form strategic spaces for community-based science, and suggest pathways to foster more robust relationships across the public-academic divide. By altering power dynamics in material, literary, and social technologies used for scientific research, we argue thatcivic technoscience enables citizens to question expert knowledge production through critical making tactics, and creates opportunities to generate credible public science.", "The potential benefits of distributed robotics systems in applications requiring situational awareness, such as search-and-rescue in emergency situations, are indisputable. The efficiency of such systems requires robotic agents capable of coping with uncertain and dynamic environmental conditions. For example, after an earthquake, a tremendous effort is spent for days to reach to surviving victims where robotic swarms or other distributed robotic systems might play a great role in achieving this faster. However, current technology falls short of offering centimeter scale mobile agents that can function effectively under such conditions. Insects, the inspiration of many robotic swarms, exhibit an unmatched ability to navigate through such environments while successfully maintaining control and stability. We have benefitted from recent developments in neural engineering and neuromuscular stimulation research to fuse the locomotory advantages of insects with the latest developments in wireless networking technologies to enable biobotic insect agents to function as search-and-rescue agents. Our research efforts towards this goal include development of biobot electronic backpack technologies, establishment of biobot tracking testbeds to evaluate locomotion control efficiency, investigation of biobotic control strategies with Gromphadorhina portentosa cockroaches and Manduca sexta moths, establishment of a localization and communication infrastructure, modeling and controlling collective motion by learning deterministic and stochastic motion models, topological motion modeling based on these models, and the development of a swarm robotic platform to be used as a testbed for our algorithms.", "Understanding the complex properties of electronic and spintronic devices at the micro-and nanoscale is a topic of intense current interest as it becomes increasingly important for scientific progress and technological applications. In operando characterization of such devices by scanning probe techniques is particularly well-suited for the microscopic study of these properties. We have developed a scanning probe microscope (SPM) which is capable of both standard force imaging (atomic, magnetic, electrostatic) and simultaneous electrical transport measurements. We utilize flexible and inexpensive FPGA (field-programmable gate array) hardware and a custom software framework developed in National Instrument's LabVIEW environment to perform the various aspects of microscope operation and device measurement. The FPGA-based approach enables sensitive, real-time cantilever frequency-shift detection. Using this system, we demonstrate electrostatic force microscopy of an electrically biased graphene field-effect transistor device. The combination of SPM and electrical transport also enables imaging of the transport response to a localized perturbation provided by the scanned cantilever tip. Facilitated by the broad presence of LabVIEW in the experimental sciences and the openness of our software solution, our system permits a wide variety of combined scanning and transport measurements by providing standardized interfaces and flexible access to all aspects of a measurement (input and output signals, and processed data). Our system also enables precise control of timing (synchronization of scanning and transport operations) and implementation of sophisticated feedback protocols, and thus should be broadly interesting and useful to practitioners in the field.

This unmanned aerial system is mainly aimed at developing and validating advanced modeling methodologies for flexible aircrafts. A compendium of the system is provided in this paper, together with a deeper discussion of how CIRA developed the structural and aeroelastic design of HAPD. Some experimental tests performed to validate the main concepts are also presented. The vehicle has an unconventional joined-wing configuration that mitigates undesired extreme flexibility, but that results in a more complicated design. First, aeroelasticity has been taken into account from the preliminary stages of design because flexibility significantly affects aircraft behavior. Second, the HAPD structure is redundant with regard to constraints (because of its joined wing), thus making the internal forces dependent on the stiffness distribution. For these reasons, the availability of an integrated methodology that can support the structural design is mandatory. The output of such a methodology consists of primary structure stiffness distributions (fuselage, wings, and vertical tail), compatibly with the absence of any aeroelastic instability, and structural failure under operative loads.", "This paper presents a real-time monocular vision solution for MAVs to autonomously search for and land on an arbitrary landing site. The autonomous MAV is provided with only one single reference image of the landing site with an unknown size before initiating this task. To search for such landing sites, we extend a well-known visual SLAM algorithm that enables autonomous navigation of the MAV in unknown environments. A multi-scale ORB feature based method is implemented and integrated into the SLAM framework for landing site detection. We use a RANSAC-based method to locate the landing site within the map of the SLAM system, taking advantage of those map points associated with the detected landing site. We demonstrate the efficiency of the presented vision system in autonomous flight, and compare its accuracy with ground truth data provided by an external tracking system.", "Variable Impedance Actuators (VIA) have received increasing attention in recent years as many novel applications involving interactions with an unknown and dynamic environment including humans require actuators with dynamics that are not well-achieved by classical stiff actuators. This paper presents an overview of the different VIAs developed and proposes a classification based on the principles through which the variable stiffness and damping are achieved. The main classes are active impedance by control, inherent compliance and damping actuators, inertial actuators, and combinations of them, which are then further divided into subclasses. This classification allows for designers of new devices to orientate and take inspiration and users of VIA's to be guided in the design and implementation process for their targeted application.

Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) opened the door to the first custom nuclease-targeted genome engineering in the late 1990s. However, ZFNs remained out of reach for most research labs because of the difficulty of production, high costs, and modest efficacy in many applications. Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) were built upon a DNA binding system discovered in a group of plant bacterial pathogens and broadened custom nuclease technology, showing significant improvements in both targeting flexibility and efficiency. Perhaps most importantly, TALENs are open source and easy to produce, providing zebrafish laboratories around the world with affordable tools that can be made in-house rapidly, at low cost, and with reliably high activity. Now a new system for targeted genome engineering derived from the CRISPR/Cas system in eubacteria and archaea promises to simplify this process further. Together, these tools will help overcome many of the bottlenecks that have constrained gene targeting in zebrafish, paving the way for advanced genome engineering applications in this model teleost.", null, ["Data-Flow Threads (DF-Threads) is a new execution model that permits to seamlessly distribute the workload across several cores (in a multi-core) and several nodes (in a multi-node/multi-board configuration).", "In this paper, the advance in deploying this execution model is shown while developing it by using a combination of a simulator model (i.e., the COTSon framework) and a reconfigurable hardware platform (i.e., the AXIOM-board).

In particular, well-known programming models that are used to exploit the Thread-Level Parallelism such as Cilk, OpenMPI and Jump are compared with DF-thread execution. Cilk is good for multi-cores, but it is not suitable for multi-nodes systems. In the latter cases, the distribution of the workload could be managed partly by the programmer when using programming models such as message-passing (OpenMPI has been chosen for reference) or distributed shared-memory (Jump in our case).", "The obtained results show that a DF-Thread execution on a cluster of eight 4-core boards can provide a speed-up of more than 14x compared to the same configuration when using OpenMPI and more than 80x when compared with a OpenMPI single core, single node execution."], "Current high-performance-thin-layer-chromatography instrumentation is offline and stepwise automated. However, moderate miniaturization offers many advantages and together with the transfer of modern print and media technologies to the field of chromatography (office chromatography) it opens up new avenues. This is demonstrated in an allin-one open-source system developed for planar chromatography and especially for ultrathin-layer chromatography. Using an InkShield board to control a thermal inkjet cartridge, picoliter drops were printed at a resolution of 96 dpi on the adsorbent layer. Using Marlin, a popular firmware in 3D printing, Cartesian movement of the print head was made possible for full control of the printing process. Open-source software was developed to control the device in each operation step. Sample solutions and mobile phase were inkjet-printed, exemplarily shown for the analysis of dye- or paraben-mixture solutions. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were investigated for documentation. For example, deep UV LEDs gave access to 254 nm light, and RGB LEDs gave access to the visible-light range. Calibration functions with correlation coefficients superior to 0.999 were obtained by videodensitometry. The developed modular open-source hardware was compact (26 X 31 X 26 cm(3)), light (<3 kg), and affordable ((sic)810). For the given analyses, the footprint of current instrumentation needed was miniaturized by a factor of 9. The highly reduced material design complies with green chemistry and lean laboratory.

These diagnostics monitor the fabrication of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA), which detect and flag any non-uniformity that may potentially harm PEMFC performance and/or lifetime. This will require quantitative thresholds and a clear distinction between harmful defects and harmless coating irregularities. Thus, novel fuel cell hardware with quasi in-situ infrared (IR) thermography capabilities is utilized to understand how bare spots in the cathode electrode impact MEA lifetime. An accelerated stress test (AST) simulates chemical and mechanical degradation modes seen in vehicular operation. The actual open circuit voltage and rate of change of this voltage are used as in-situ indicators for MEA failure, enabling capture of the progression of failure point development. Bare spot coating irregularities located at the center of the electrode were found to have no impact on MEA lifetime when compared to a pristine MEA. However, MEA lifetime was found to be considerably shortened when these same irregularities are located at the cathode inlet and, especially, the anode inlet regions of the fuel cell.

Sensor timing using dedicated hardware is the de-facto method to achieve optimal sensor performance, but the solutions available today have limited flexibility and requires much effort when changing sensors. This article presents requirements and suggestions for a highly accurate, reconfigurable sensor timing system that simplifies integration of sensor systems and navigation systems for UAVs. Both typical avionics sensors, like GNSS receivers and IMUs, and more complex sensors, such as cameras, are supported. To verify the design, an implementation named the SenTiBoard was created, along with a software support package and a baseline sensor-suite. With the solution presented in this paper we get a measurement resolution of 10 nanoseconds and we can transfer up to 7.6 megabytes per second. If the sensor suite includes a GNSS receiver with a pulse-per-second (PPS) reference, the sensor measurements can be related to an absolute time reference (UTC) with a clock drift of 1.9 microseconds per second RMS.

Due to their wearable nature, they generally capture noisier signals and can only be trained with signals belonging to the device user (biometric verification). In this article, we assess the feasibility of using low-cost wearable sensors-photoplethysmogram (PPG), electrocardiogram (ECG), accelerometer (ACC), and galvanic skin response (GSR)-for biometric verification. We present a prototype, built with low-cost wearable sensors, that was used to capture data from 25 subjects while seated (at resting state), walking, and seated (after a gentle stroll). We used this data to evaluate how the different combinations of signals affected the biometric verification process. Our results showed that the low-cost sensors currently being embedded in many fitness bands and smart-watches can be combined to enable biometric verification. We report and compare the results obtained by all tested configurations.

The purpose of this study is to perform a practical evaluation of the use of biofeedback sensors, when employed to know the behavior of the player in different genres of games. More precisely, an experiment with three biofeedback sensors (Electrocardiography, Electrodermal Activity Sensor, and Electromyography) was conducted to verify the suitability of these sensors in identifying the player's emotions according to the genre of the game.

The well-known simultaneous localization and mapping problem of mobile robots has been addressed in the literaturewithout specifically taking into account the robot's motion control tasks. Moreover, its implementation can cost more than the robot itself. Robot motion control strategies developed in the literature either 1) rely on sophisticated hardware platforms, 2) assume noise-free environment, or 3) are based on abstract theories, which are validated using computer simulations only. The current work solves the navigation and mapping problems of mobile robots using open-source hardware and range-only measurements from a network of radio sources. The hardware platform used in this work is customized such that it is cost-effective and easy-to-implement, addressing the aforementioned issues in developing motion control strategies. The current strategy permits the robot to estimate its position and orientation and builds a map of its operating environment using radio frequency signals received from radio sources. It then navigates through a path defined by a set of two-dimensional points on the ground using a motion control strategy in cooperation with a computational intelligence tool. The proposed robot navigation and mapping scheme was tested in an indoor laboratory environment and its performance was compared with the simulation counterpart using a commercial robot simulator.", "In this paper, a new smart voltage and current monitoring system (SVCMS) technique is proposed.

Neural activity represents a functional readout of neurons that is increasingly important to monitor in a wide range of experiments. Extracellular recordings have emerged as a powerful technique for measuring neural activity because these methods do not lead to the destruction or degradation of the cells being measured. Current approaches to electrophysiology have a low throughput of experiments due to manual supervision and expensive equipment. This bottleneck limits broader inferences that can be achieved with numerous long-term recorded samples. Approach. We developed Piphys, an inexpensive open source neurophysiological recording platform that consists of both hardware and software. It is easily accessed and controlled via a standard web interface through Internet of Things (IoT) protocols. Main results. We used a Raspberry Pi as the primary processing device along with an Intan bioamplifier. We designed a hardware expansion circuit board and software to enable voltage sampling and user interaction.

However, the lack of a standard architecture that connects the concept of chemical transformations universally to software and hardware provides a barrier to using the results of these optimizations and could cause the loss of relevant data and prevent reactions from being reproducible or unexpected findings verifiable or explainable. In this Perspective, we describe how the development of the field of digital chemistry or chemputation, that is the universal code-enabled control of chemical reactions using a standard language and ontology, will remove these barriers allowing users to focus on the chemistry and plug in algorithms according to the problem space to be explored or unit function to be optimized. We describe a standard hardware (the chemical processing programming architecture.the ChemPU) to encompass all chemical synthesis, an approach which unifies all chemistry automation strategies, from solid-phase peptide synthesis, to HTE flow chemistry platforms, while at the same time establishing a publication standard so that researchers can exchange chemical code (chi DL) to ensure reproducibility and interoperability. Not only can a vast range of different chemistries be plugged into the hardware, but the ever-expanding developments in software and algorithms can also be accommodated. These technologies, when combined will allow chemistry, or chemputation, to follow computation.that is the running of code across many different types of capable hardware to get the same result every time with a low error rate.", "Pelvic fractures are uncommon but complex injuries associated with a high degree of morbidity and mortality. Most fractures involving the pelvis, specifically the sacrum, can be effectively stabilized with iliosacral screws alone. However, significantly unstable fractures, particularly vertical shear patterns, as well as U-type variant sacral fracture patterns that create spinopelvic instability, require the addition of lumbopelvic fixation. The surgical technique involves neurologic decompression as necessary, multiplanar reduction of the pelvic ring and sacrum, and placement of stable fixation. Treatment of these severe injuries requiring lumbopelvic fixation is challenging and requires active collaboration between spine trauma and pelvis trauma surgeons. Although not routinely used, lumbopelvic fixation is an essential technique for the stabilization of complex pelvis fractures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

For mobility support, IETF developed PMIPv6 to enable user devices to be connected to the internet without being disconnected when passing by different network areas. Unlike wired network, a wireless network increased the potential threats to every device that is wirelessly connected to internet. As a result, security threats and attacks are critical issues which are needed to be address. In addition, provides mobility for devices in different network area require different security measures and configuration to be configured such as user device registration and authentication in PMIPv6 inter/intra-domain as well as providing fast delivery of multimedia content.

Recent work shows that ocean acidification will negatively affect calcification processes for many species, including reef-building corals. It is possible that OA may cause diminished fish respiratory stress and impact sensory capabilities. To date most all of these scientific findings are from short-term experiments in laboratory aquaria on limited sets of organisms. The question posed, how can scientists perform long-term in situ CO2 experiments like those performed on land as part of the Free CO2 Air Enrichment (FACE) experiments? The desire is for experiments that can confirm conclusions drawn from laboratory experiments.", "The goal of FOCE (Free Ocean CO2 Enrichment) technology is to provide precise in situ control of pH within experimental chambers at a variety of environmental sites. This goal extends to include minimal effect on other environmental experimental conditions while supporting evaluation of the consequences of ocean acidification on marine organisms and communities. The techniques for chemical and physical control of CO2 chemistry are well understood, however they heavily depend on the marine environments of interest. The techniques and application technologies used to execute FOCE required considerable time to develop while building expertise that allows transfer to new environmental situations. MBARI has now put FOCE together in an open source package of technology and expertise in a product called xFOCE. xFOCE shows how FOCE techniques cost-effective and adaptable, reduce the learning curve and make it a useful tool for multi-disciplinary Ocean Acidification (OA) studies in any marine environment. xFOCE includes the idea of community building just as other open technology projects do to enable OA researchers. xFOCE gives baseline references designs on the use of FOCE tools and techniques by collating contributing expertise and technical support form the OA community currently using the xFOCE concept.", "In this presentation we show how the process of underwater technology started and developed into an open source project.

System is designed to assure reliability and safety of power supply subsystems. It is divided into two main components: remote and local. Remote part is located near tokamak, whereas local part can be localised away from the tokamak area. The remote side consists of custom, standalone devices. On the other hand, the local device is based on the uTCA.4 architecture. Components are connected with an optic fibre over a link-layer protocol which provides high throughput, low latency and transmission redundancy.

This unmanned aerial system is mainly aimed at developing and validating advanced modeling methodologies for flexible aircrafts. A compendium of the system is provided in this paper, together with a deeper discussion of how CIRA developed the structural and aeroelastic design of HAPD. Some experimental tests performed to validate the main concepts are also presented. The vehicle has an unconventional joined-wing configuration that mitigates undesired extreme flexibility, but that results in a more complicated design. First, aeroelasticity has been taken into account from the preliminary stages of design because flexibility significantly affects aircraft behavior. Second, the HAPD structure is redundant with regard to constraints (because of its joined wing), thus making the internal forces dependent on the stiffness distribution. For these reasons, the availability of an integrated methodology that can support the structural design is mandatory. The output of such a methodology consists of primary structure stiffness distributions (fuselage, wings, and vertical tail), compatibly with the absence of any aeroelastic instability, and structural failure under operative loads.", null, "Modeling the structure and evolution of products is important from the standpoint of improving quality and maintainability. With the increasing popularity of open-source processes for developing both software and physical systems, there is a need to develop computational models of product evolution in such dynamic product developments scenarios. Existing studies on the evolution of products involve modeling products as networks, taking snapshots of the structure at different time steps, and comparing the structural characteristics. Such approaches are limited because they do not capture the underlying dynamics through which products evolve. In this paper, we take a step toward addressing this gap by presenting a generative network model for product evolution. The generative model is based on different mechanisms though which networks evolve-addition and removal of nodes, addition and removal of links. The model links local network observations to global network structures. It is utilized for modeling and analyzing the evolution of a software product (Drupal) and a physical product (RepRap) developed by open source processes. For the software product, the generated networks are compared with the actual product structures using various network measures including average degree, density, clustering coefficients, average shortest path, propagation cost, clustered cost, and degree distributions. For the physical product, the product evolution is analyzed in terms of the proposed mechanisms. The proposed model has three general applications: longitudinal studies of a product's evolution, cross-sectional studies of evolution of different products, and predictive analyzes.", "Human-scale mobile robots with arms have the potential to assist people with a variety of tasks. We present a proof-of-concept system that has enabled a person with severe quadriplegia named Henry Evans to shave himself in his own home using a general purpose mobile manipulator (PR2 from Willow Garage). The robot primarily provides assistance by holding a tool (e.g., an electric shaver) at user-specified locations around the user's head, while he/she moves his/her head against it. If the robot detects forces inappropriate for the task (e.g., shaving), it withdraws the tool. The robot also holds a mirror with its other arm, so that the user can see what he/she is doing. For all aspects of the task, the robot and the human work together. The robot uses a series of distinct semi-autonomous subsystems during the task to navigate to poses next to the wheelchair, attain initial arm configurations, register a 3D model of the person's head, move the tool to coarse semantically-labeled tool poses (e.g, \"Cheek\"), and finely position the tool via incremental movements. Notably, while moving the tool near the user's head, the robot uses an ellipsoidal coordinate system attached to the 3D head model. In addition to describing the complete robotic system, we report results from Henry Evans using it to shave both sides of his face while sitting in his wheelchair at home. He found the process to be long (54 minutes) and the interface unintuitive. Yet, he also found the system to be comfortable to use, felt safe while using it, was satisfied with it, and preferred it to a human caregiver.", "This paper addresses the difficult task of implementing the concept of Slow Tech, that is, information and communication technology (ICT) that is good, clean and fair, in a business environment.

Therefore, knowledge of the annual rate of water reservoir sedimentation is an important issue to be resolved in one of the most water-stressed regions in the western Mediterranean basin. This paper describes the sensors developed in collaboration with technology-based enterprises (aerial drone, floating drone, and underwater drone), and the methodology for integration of the different types of data acquired to monitor the reservoirs of the SRB. The proposed solution was applied to 21 reservoirs of the SRB. The proposed methodology is based on the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) for photogrammetry of the reservoir surface area. For each reservoir, two flights were completed, with 20 cm and 5 cm resolution, respectively. Then, a triangular irregular network mesh was generated by GIS techniques. Surface water vehicles (USV) and underwater remote-operated vehicles (ROV) were used to undertake bathymetric surveys. In addition, water quality measurements were made with an ROV device. The main results consist of topographic and bathymetric measurements for each reservoir, obtained by using equipment based on OpenSource technology. According to the results, the annual rate of storage capacity loss of water resources in the SRB ' s reservoirs is 0.33%.", "A new approach for solar tracking, based on deep learning techniques, is being studied and tested using Tensorflow, an open source machine learning framework.

In the recent paradigm where objects in the world will be connected with each other, commonly referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT), people begin to consider the challenges and opportunities to utilize the huge data sets generated, also referred to as Big data. One of the active research topics in dealing with the IoT's big data is the practical feasibility of algorithms used in classical machine learning but also in a newly emerging branch, called deep learning. In this article, we demonstrate a quantitative analysis comparing performance between classical machine learning and deep learning algorithms with a human movement direction detecting application based on analog pyroelectric infrared (PIR) sensor signals. The sensing data acquisition and retrieval system is implemented with the open-source IoT software platforms based on the oneM2M standard. With the analog PIR data sets collected from 30 subjects, we perform experimental studies comparing classical machine learning and deep learning algorithms in terms of economic feasibility, scalability, generality, and real-time detection performance. The results show that classical machine learning shows better performance in real-time detection (i.e., with the sensing values within the first 0.5 s). In contrast, our simple deep learning model achieves about 90% accuracy for detecting moving directions even with the data sets from only three subjects and a single PIR sensor. Moreover, it could be applied to a larger number of subjects without updates.", "Wireless networks-on-chips (NoCs) (WiNoCs) have emerged as a possible solution to the nonscalable multihop data transmission paths in traditional wired NoC architectures. Using low-power transceivers in NoC switches, novel WiNoC architectures have been shown to achieve higher energy efficiency with improved peak bandwidth and reduced on-chip data transfer latency. However, using wireless interconnects for intrachip data transfer over an unguided medium introduces additional security vulnerabilities in on-chip communication arising from either external attackers or internal hardware Trojans. In this article, we propose a mechanism to make the wireless communication in a WiNoC secure against persistent jamming-based denial-ofservice (DoS) attacks and eavesdropping (ED) from both external and internal attackers. Persistent jamming attacks on the on-chip wireless medium will cause interference in data transfer over the duration of the attack resulting in errors in contiguous bits, known as burst errors. Therefore, we use a burst-error correction code to monitor the rate of burst errors received over the wireless medium and deploy a machine-learning (ML) classifier to detect the persistent jamming attack and distinguish it from random burst errors. In the event of a persistent jamming attack, alternate routing strategies are proposed to avoid the DoS attack over the wireless medium, so that a secure data transfer can be sustained even in the presence of persistent jamming. In the event of an external ED attack, we deploy a low-latency and lightweight data scrambling method to secure communication over the wireless channel. In the case of an internal ED, we propose a mechanism to identify the attacker and prevent the attack. We evaluate the proposed techniques on a WiNoC in the presence of DoS and ED attacks from both internal and external attackers. On an average, 99.87% of the attack on DoS detection was achieved with the chosen ML classifier. A bandwidth degradation of <3% is experienced in the event of both DoS and ED internal attacks. The wireless interconnects are disabled in the presence of a persistent external jamming DoS attack for security, therefore eliminating the advantages of the wireless interconnections making the performance of the WiNoC comparable with that of a wired NoC. Although scrambling overheads are incurred in the presence of an external ED attack, the overheads are minimized by adopting simple XOR-based encoding and decoding.", "Open Innovation is widely explored, and many technologies are developed to support the involvement of stakeholders in its distributed co-design process, i.e. when actors work asynchronously and at a geographical distance. One of the fundamental parameters for the success of distributed collaborative approaches is the trust that the actors have in each other, in the current process and in technology. However, practitioners make little use of trust as a parameter for piloting and supporting co-creation of value. The lack of understanding of the mechanisms involved seems to explain this situation. Using a multiple-case-study analysis of co-design in the field of energy, this paper proposes to identify the levers in Living Lab favouring the trust between stakeholders. In addition to practical illustration, this paper provides a first co-design project management framework for practitioners, through the development of the \"Co-coon Matrix\".", "The low-cost Open qPCR instrument can be used for different tasks in the aptamer selection process: quantification of DNA, cycle course optimization, screening, and final binding characterization.

We performed systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) using the Open qPCR to optimize each amplification step. The Open qPCR instrument identified the best aptamer candidate. The Open qPCR has the capacity to perform melt curves, and we used this function to perform thermofluorimetric analysis (TFA) to quantify target-aptamer binding.

In particular, it proposes the platform Sparus II AUV and a set of planning algorithms to conduct these new AUV capabilities. These algorithms generate trajectories under motion constraints, which can be followed without deviations, to ensure the safety even when passing close to obstacles. View planning algorithms are also combined to decide the movements to be executed to discover the unexplored seabed or target, and to cover it with a camera or sonar. Online mapping with profiling sonars and online planning with fast sampling-based algorithms allow the execution of missions without any previous knowledge of the 3-D shape of the environment. Real 2-D results in an artificial harbor structure and simulated natural rocky canyon demonstrate the feasibility of the approach for avoiding or inspecting the underwater environment. These new AUV capabilities can be used to acquire images of the environment that can be used to inspect and map the habitat.", "Internet of Things (IoT) as a field consists of multiple coexisting and competing products and platforms.

A crucial aspect is the ability to search for the boundaries of the wildfire by exploring a wide area. However, even as wildfires are increasing today, the number of available monitoring systems that can provide support is decreasing, creating an operational gap and slow response in such urgent situations. The objective of this work is to estimate a propagating boundary and create an autonomous system that works in real time. It proposes a coordination strategy with a new methodology for estimating the periphery of a propagating phenomenon using limited observations. The complete system design, tested on the high-fidelity simulation, demonstrates that steering the vehicles toward the highest perpendicular uncertainty generates the effective predictions. The results indicate that the new coordination scheme has a large beneficial impact on uncertainty suppression. This study thus suggests that an efficient solution for suppressing uncertainty in monitoring a wildfire is to use a fleet of low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles that can be deployed quickly. Further research is needed on other deployment schemes that work in different natural disaster case studies.", "This project addresses the need for the implementation of low-cost acquisition technology in the field of vehicle engineering: the design, development, manufacture, and verification of a low-cost Arduino-based data acquisition platform to be used in <80 Hz data acquisition in vehicle dynamics, using low-cost accelerometers.

Additionally, Cloud Robotics and Robot Operating System (ROS) can offset onboard processing power. However, strong and fundamental security practices have not been applied to fully protect these systems, partially negating the benefits of IoT. Researchers are therefore tasked with finding ways of securing communications and systems. Since security and convenience are oftentimes at odds, securing many heterogeneous components without compromising performance can be daunting. Protecting systems from attacks and ensuring that connections and instructions are from approved devices, all while maintaining the performance is imperative.

The current navigation systems are highly dependent on the global positioning system and are prone to error because of global positioning system signal outages. However, advancements in onboard processing have enabled inertial navigation algorithms to perform well during short global positioning system outages. In this article, we propose an intelligent optical flow-based algorithm combined with Kalman filters to provide the navigation capability during global positioning system outages and global positioning system-denied environments. Traditional optical flow measurement uses block matching for motion vector calculation that makes the measurement task computationally expensive and slow. We propose the application of an artificial bee colony-based block matching technique for faster optical flow measurements. To effectively fuse optical flow data with inertial sensors output, we employ a modified form of extended Kalman filter. The modifications make the filter less noisy by utilizing the redundancy of sensors. We have achieved an accuracy of similar to 95% for all non-global positioning system navigation during our simulation studies. Our real-world experiments are in agreement with the simulation studies when effects of wind are taken into consideration.", "We propose an adaptive image-based visual servoing controller for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that is based on a virtual camera.

Electronics is often ignored in robotics courses. Since robotics courses are typically comprised of computer-related subjects, and mechanical and electrical engineering, these three areas should be emphasized equally. Many studies reveal impressive learning of computer science and mechanical engineering, but clear evidence of the effectiveness of electronics learning in the higher order thinking skills of middle school students is still lacking. We designed three different robotics courses with electronics subject matter introduced through experiential learning. A parallel group design was used, where three different open learning courses were implemented for middle school students. Based on results of the first and second implementations, we improved students' learning of relevant content for each successive step of the experiment. In total, 381 middle school students participated in all experiments and were surveyed using pre- and post-tests. The collected data were analyzed using a quantitative research methodology. The findings revealed that the teaching approach was effective. During the learning process, student interest in robotics increased, and overall achievement improved with a medium effect size (eta(2) = 0.13). The best results for the learning of electronics subject matter were found in the learning process (eta(2) = 0.44), where experimental sharing of electronics parts was the most evident approach used by the students. Examination of learning material structure in light of the shared electronics subject matter is analyzed and discussed and possible directions for future research are presented.", "Energy consumption in battery operated mobile devices is a critical issue. Autonomy periods are increasingly compromised as the complexity of tasks, such as the widespread video decoding ones, is also increased. While new higher-capacity batteries are being developed, techniques to control, i.e. save, the energy consumption can provide a significant benefit. This paper presents the proposal, implementation and test of a real-time closed-loop control system applicable to the power-consumption regulation of multimedia mobile devices. The novel closed loop does not need any specific power sensor but only standard performance monitoring counters (PMCs) available in common mobile processors. From them, the power consumption is estimated with an algorithm to be included into the operating system, along with the control system itself. A theoretical system model has been first developed to (1) enable the design of some controllers and (2) validate the actual results obtained from the control system prototype into a given low-cost development board. These results prove the control-system stability and the comparative suitability of classic controllers to keep the multimedia-system consumption close to the desired value in steady state with settling times as short as a single sample interval(1).", "An air quality monitoring system (AQMS) based on the IEEE/ISO/IEC 21451 standards is presented. In the development of an AQMS, we have used the GSM wireless communication module. The developed system is capable of the real-time measurement of air polluted gases, such as CO2, CO, NO2, and SO2. The machine-to-machine communication of the air quality monitoring station and PC with the sink node was successfully implemented. Various gas sensor technologies were evaluated for the system and ultimately electrochemical and infrared sensors were used. Hardware and software for an AQMS was designed and implemented. The AQMS uses an array of sensors to take the measurements of the ambient air surrounding it and wirelessly transmits the data to the base station. A graphical user interface (GUI), which makes it easy for end user(s) to interact with the system, was developed. Gas concentration values are plotted on the GUI. The defined calibration of the instruments at time interims assures that the desired accuracy is sustained. This paper offers further elucidations to design disputes raised in earlier studies.", "Since the life cycle of smartphones is becoming shorter, users are demanding new and improved smartphone features for updated smartphones, but it is difficult to know which features are the most important to users. In Internet user communities, users increasingly review smartphone functions and share information about their experiences such as complaints, problems, and satisfaction, and these user experiences have been fruitful sources for manufacturers that lead to smartphone improvements. Focusing on these user experiences, this paper proposes a systematic roadmapping process including prioritisation of smartphone feature requirements. By prioritising smartphone feature requirements, new and improved versions of smartphones that reflect user needs can be planned based on a product-market roadmap. The systematic approach consists of three parts: user-driven quality function deployment (QFD), a frequent pattern (FP)-tree algorithm, and a product-market roadmap. First, we collected data extracted from text mining in Internet user communities to construct a user-driven QFD. Second, using user experiences related to smartphone features, we applied the FP-tree algorithm to algorithmically derive a priority list of smartphone feature requirements. Finally, based on the result of the FP-tree of smartphones, we proposed guidelines to construct a product-market roadmap. It is expected that a versioning strategy can be formulated through this prioritised product-market roadmap. Furthermore, covering each step from data collection to roadmapping, this study suggests a systematic process for prioritisation of smartphone feature requirements based on user experiences.", "Monitoring mechanisms that ensure efficient crop growth are essential on many farms, especially in certain areas of the planet where water is scarce. Most farmers must assume the high cost of the required equipment in order to be able to streamline natural resources on their farms. Considering that many farmers cannot afford to install this equipment, it is necessary to look for more effective solutions that would be cheaper to implement. The objective of this study is to build virtual organizations of agents that can communicate between each other while monitoring crops. A low cost sensor architecture allows farmers to monitor and optimize the growth of their crops by streamlining the amount of resources the crops need at every moment. Since the hardware has limited processing and communication capabilities, our approach uses the PANGEA architecture to overcome this limitation. Specifically, we will design a system that is capable of collecting heterogeneous information from its environment, using sensors for temperature, solar radiation, humidity, pH, moisture and wind. A major outcome of our approach is that our solution is able to merge heterogeneous data from sensors and produce a response adapted to the context. In order to validate the proposed system, we present a case study in which farmers are provided with a tool that allows us to monitor the condition of crops on a TV screen using a low cost device.", "In animal behavioral biology, an automated observing/training system may be useful for several reasons: (a) continuous observation of animals for documentation of specific, irregular events, (b) long-term intensive training of animals in preparation for behavioral experiments, (c) elimination of potential cues and biases induced by humans during training and testing. Here, we describe an open-source-based system named CATOS (Computer Aided Training/Observing System) developed for such situations. There are several notable features in this system. CATOS is flexible and low cost because it is based on free open-source software libraries, common hardware parts, and open-system electronics based on Arduino. Automated video condensation is applied, leading to significantly reduced video data storage compared to the total active hours of the system. A data-viewing utility program helps a user browse recorded data quickly and more efficiently. With these features, CATOS has the potential to be applied to many different animal species in various environments such as laboratories, zoos, or even private homes. Also, an animal's free access to the device without constraint, and a gamified learning process, enhance the animal's welfare and enriches their environment. As a proof of concept, the system was built and tested with two different species. Initially, the system was tested for approximately 10 months with a domesticated cat. The cat was successfully and fully automatically trained to discriminate three different spoken words. Then, in order to test the system's adaptability to other species and hardware components, we used it to train a laboratory rat for 3 weeks.", "The Internet of Things (IoT) is the interconnection of physical objects, devices, vehicles and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity that enables these objects to gather and exchange data. For example, in educational organizations, we require additional labor to do jobs such as turn on & off the lights, fans in the laboratories. In some cases, the students may forget to switch off the electrical components like fans, AC and lights in their classrooms. As we take the institution as our scenario, there comes the need of more labors to complete the tasks. And there occurs the wastage of power supply and additional labor cost. To overcome these problems, we are automating the whole system through IoT system. This system can save the energy by efficient power management system of a room which employs certain mechanisms managed by a Microcontroller. This system serves us to control the environment, power and the security management. To provide a better security, the user is provided with live stream from several IP cameras. This paper helps the user to control the system from anywhere at any time from a single terminal through the internet which can be done at a reasonable cost.", "A 1-year data set of ground-based GPS signal observations aiming at geometric elevation angles below +2 degrees is analysed. Within the \"GLESER\" measurement campaign about 2600 validated setting events were recorded by the \"OpenGPS\" open-loop tracking receiver at an observation site located at 52.3808 degrees N, 13.0642 degrees E between January and December 2014. The measurements confirm the feasibility of open-loop signal tracking down to geometric elevation angles of -1 to -1.5 degrees extending the corresponding closed-loop tracking range by up to 1 degrees. The study is based on the premise that observations of low-elevation events by a ground-based receiver may serve as test cases for space-based radio occultation measurements, even if the latter proceed at a significantly faster temporal scale. The results support the conclusion that the open-loop Doppler model has negligible influence on the derived carrier frequency profile for strong signal-to-noise density ratios above about 30 dB Hz. At lower signal levels, however, the OpenGPS receiver's dual-channel design, which tracks the same signal using two Doppler models differing by 10 Hz, uncovers a notable bias. The repeat patterns of the GPS orbit traces in terms of azimuth angle reveal characteristic signatures in both signal amplitude and Doppler frequency with respect to the topography close to the observation site. Mean vertical refractivity gradients, extracted from ECMWF meteorological fields, correlate weakly to moderately with observed signal amplitude fluctuations at geometric elevation angles between +1 and +2 degrees. Results from multiple phase screen simulations support the interpretation that these fluctuations are at least partly produced by atmospheric multipath; at negative elevation angles diffraction at the ground surface seems to contribute.", "The smart grid is a complex and interconnected system where actions and events in one part of the system affect operations elsewhere. In order to perform a rigorous analysis, a common and deterministic timing reference is required. This paper addresses this need, using as use case the substation automation system, a key element of the smart grid, where utilities, classically, have opted for a satellite clock providing a timing signal and different ways to distribute it through the substation. This paper proposes an appropriate solution for the substation needs presenting the implementation details, the analysis of the system reliability, safety, and security together with promising results and novel mechanisms for providing timing on the grid.", "The advancement of embedded system technologies, sensing techniques and wireless technologies provide new possibilities to monitor human activities at all times.

Non-intrusive wearable heart rate sensors monitor patients and detect abnormal situations. Data is analyzed and sent in real time in order to provide necessary help when it is needed. The Stroke Center framework is briefly described in this paper with guidelines for future work.", "In this paper, a set of digital artifacts related to simple examples of structural engineering are presented. The artifacts are real-time applications and visualizations of typical problems students from the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) schools are acquainted with. The real-time nature of the examples allow a high level of interaction between humans and the classic visualization of results, namely, bending and shear force diagrams, internal stresses distributions, and contour plots. These artifacts may provide in AEC a twofold educational target: (i) for users, to provide visual understanding in real time of typical problems that must be understood in classic lectures of structural engineering; (ii) for developers, to provide meaningful applications of applied digital fabrication using sensors, microcontrollers, and GUI's and their potential in the development of tools related to Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) and the Internet of Things (IoT) among students of the AEC sector.", "Microfluidic devices based on polydimethylsiloxane shown a plethora of experimental possibilities due to good transparency, flexibility and ability to adhere reversibly and irreversibly to distinct materials. Though PDMS is a milestone in microfluidic developments, its cost and handling directed the field to search for new options. 3D printing technology nowadays starts a revolution offering materials and possibilities that can contribute positively to current methodologies. Here we explored the fused deposition modeling 3D printing technique to obtain integrated, transparent and sealed microchannels made with polylactic acid, a cheap alternative material to set up microfluidic systems. Using a home-made 3D printer, devices could be assembled in a simplified process, enabling the integration of different materials such as paper, glass, wire and polymers within the microchannel. To demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, a 3D-printed electronic tongue sensor was built, enabling the distinction of basic tastes below the human threshold. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The implementation of facial expressions has been found to significantly increase the interaction capabilities of humanoid robots. For speech, displaying a correct articulation with sound is mandatory to avoid audiovisual illusions like the McGurk effect (leading to comprehension errors) as well as to enhance the intelligibility in noise. This work describes the design, construction and testing of an animatronic talking face developed for the iCub robot. This talking head has an articulated jaw and four independent lip movements actuated by five motors. It is covered by a specially designed elastic tissue cover whose hemlines at the lips are attached to the motors via connecting linkages.", "Geosensor networks and sensor webs are two technologies widely used for determining our exposure to pollution levels and ensuring that this information is publicly available. However, most of these networks are independent from each other and often designed for specific domains, hindering the integration of sensor data from different sources. We contributed to the integration of several environmental sensor networks in the context of the IDEA project. The objective of this project was to measure noise and air quality pollution levels in urban areas in Belgium using low-cost sensors. This paper presents the IDEA Environmental Measurement Cloud as a proof-of-conceptData-as-a-Service (DaaS) cloud platform that integrates environmental sensor networks with a sensor web. Our DaaS platform implements a federated two-layer architecture to loosely couple together sensor networks deployed over a wide geographical area with web services. It offers several data access, discovery, and visualization services to the public while serving as a scientific tool for noise pollution research. After one year of operation, it hosts approximately 6.5 TB of environmental data and offers to the public near real-time noise pollution measurements from over 40 locations in Belgium.", "The timescales of biological processes, primarily those inherent to the molecular mechanisms of disease, are long (> mu s) and involve complex interactions of systems consisting of many atoms (>10(6)). Simulating these systems requires an advanced computational approach, and as such, coarse-grained (CG) models have been developed and highly optimised for accelerator hardware, primarily graphics processing units (GPUs). In this review, I discuss the implementation of CG models for biologically relevant systems, and show how such models can be optimised and perform well on GPU-accelerated hardware. Several examples of GPU implementations of CG models for both molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations on purely GPU and hybrid CPU/GPU architectures are presented. Both the hardware and algorithmic limitations of various models, which depend greatly on the application of interest, are discussed.", null, "This research analyzes the affiliated multipartite social networks of hackathon style mass collaboration events. Using social network analysis we model the innovation networks for NASA's International Space Apps Challenge and use social network analysis to understand the structure of and relationships within the modeled networks. Using metrics such as degree, degree distribution, degree correlations, and density, the resulting models and study answer questions like: can social network statistics act as indicators of innovation performance within a network and which statistics provide insight to the likelihood of innovation performance? We address these research questions by building the affiliation networks for the 2012 and 2013 NASA International Space Apps Challenges and applying Gnyawali and Srivastava's conceptual model on cluster and network effects against these real-world networks to empirically prove the likelihood of innovation.

Published by Elsevier B.V.", "Supporting the concurrent execution of multiple tasks on lightweight sensor nodes could enable the deployment of independent applications on a shared wireless sensor network, thus saving cost and time by exploiting infrastructures which are typically underutilized if dedicated to a single task. Existing approaches to wireless sensor network programming provide limited support to concurrency at the cost of reducing the generality and the expressiveness of the language adopted. This paper presents a java-compatible platform for wireless sensor networks which provides a thorough support to preemptive multitasking while allowing the programmers to write their applications in java. The proposed approach has been implemented and tested on top of VirtualSense, an ultra-low-power wireless sensor mote providing a java-compatible runtime environment. Performance and scalability of the solution are discussed in light of extensive experiments performed on representative benchmarks.", "In this paper we provide the fundamentals and a proof of concept for a completely new approach in multi-modular self-reconfigurable mobile robotics. The architecture described consists of two main parts being strongly interconnected. The first part is the development of an architecture based upon a high-speed fully switched Ethernet-network. This approach contrasts the way existing platforms were designed. The use of a switched Ethernet-network, instead of commonly used bus-systems, depicts a paradigm change in this field of robotics. The second part stipulates a strict decomposition of the robot module into various submodules. A powerful main-CPU, running a mu Clinux, represents the central entity of the architecture. It is supported by several peripheral microcontrollers, which perform low-level tasks and data preprocessing only. The submodules are treated as blackboxes, being independant from each other, only loosely coupled by a local SPI-bus. This results in a more robust and manageable system. As the number of submodules is not restricted, the architecture is very flexible. The employment of standards like POSIX and Ethernet severely eases the developmental process and further research.", "The paper is the second part (out of five) of the research survey of WILGA Symposium work, May 2012 Edition, concerned with accelerator technology and high energy physics experiments.

This paper presents the experience of teaching contemporary mixed-signal electronic system design with PSoC in the Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. An innovative teaching method was adopted, which involved designing a flexible experimental board, designing four experiments of different levels and with different teaching objectives, writing a textbook, and instructing students in out-of-class activities.

Since the metric scale cannot be directly recovered from visual input only, several methods have been proposed in the recent literature to overcome this limitation by exploiting independent 'metric' information from additional onboard sensors. The flexibility of most approaches is, however, often limited by the need of constantly tracking over time a certain set of features in the environment, thus potentially suffering from possible occlusions or loss of tracking during flight. In this respect, in this paper we address the problem of estimating the scale of the observed linear velocity in the UAV body frame from direct measurement of the instantaneous (and non-metric) optical flow, and the integration of an onboard Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for providing (metric) acceleration readings. To this end, two different estimation techniques are developed and critically compared: a standard Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and a novel nonlinear observer stemming from the adaptive control literature. Results based on simulated and real data recorded during a quadrotor UAV flight demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.", "The Beam Instrumentation Group (BI) is responsible for designing, building and maintaining the instrumen ts that allow observation of the particle beams and the measurement of related parameters for all CERN accelerators and transfer lines.

Details on some of the challenges and proposed technical solutions will be presented.", "Robotic airborne chemical source localization has critical applications ranging from search and rescue to hazard detection to pollution assessment. Previous demonstrations on flying robots have required search times in excess of ten minutes, or required computation-intensive signal processing, largely because of the slow response of semiconductor gas sensors. To mitigate these limitations, we developed a hybrid biological/synthetic chemical sensing platform consisting of a moth antenna on an aerial robot. We demonstrate that our robot, a 9 centimeter nano drone, can repeatedly detect and reach the source of a volatile organic chemical plume in less than a minute. We also introduce wind vanes to passively aim the robot upwind, greatly simplifying control. To our knowledge this is the first odor-finding robot to use this approach, and it allows for localization using feedback only from sensors carried on-board rather than GPS, allowing indoor operation. The chemical sensor consists of a hybrid biological/synthetic integrated chemical sensor (electroantennogram) using an excised antenna of the hawkmoth Manduca sexta and associated miniaturized electrophysiology conditioning circuitry. Our robot performs an insect-inspired cast-and-surge search algorithm inspired by the odor-tracking behavior observed in Manduca sexta. These results represent a significant step toward robots that have the speed and sensitivity of biological systems.", "Edge computing is a continuum that includes the computing resources from cloud to things. Ecosystem of things (EoT) is a subsystem of the ecosystem of edge computing, which potentially contains trillions of devices of things and directly interacts with the physical world. This paper surveys the state of the art of EoT by focusing on the computing infrastructure aspect with a forward-looking perspective. We point out a trend of smart edge computing with four types of smartness and intelligence. We address three fundamental questions. 1) What capabilities and how much energy efficiency are the hardware providing? What is the future growth potential? 2) What abstractions are provided by the system software? Are they adequate to support smart edge computing? 3) What ecosystem architectures have been proposed for the coordination of things, the edge, and the cloud? Are they meeting the needs to encourage innovation but avoid unnecessary ecosystem fragmentation? We examine advances from both industry and academia, including research results, visions, and project concepts. We also point out future research directions.", "Issues related to the evolving role of citizen science and open science are reviewed and discussed in this article. We focus on the changing approaches to science, research and development related to the turn to openness and transparency, which has made science more open and inclusive, even for non-researchers. Reproducible and collaborative research, which is driven by the open access principles, involves citizens in many research fields. The article shows how international support is pushing citizen science forward, and how citizens' involvement is becoming more important. A basic scientometric analysis (based on the Web of Science Core Collection as the source of peer reviewed articles) provides a first insight into the diffusion of the citizen science concept in the field of Geography, mapping the growth of citizen science articles over time, the spectrum of geographical journals that publish them, and their citation rate compared to other scientific disciplines. The authors also discuss future challenges of citizen science and its potential, which for the time being seems to be not fully utilized in some fields, including geographical research.", "This paper presents a smart e-nose device to monitor indoor hazardous air. Indoor hazardous odor is a threat for seniors, infants, children, pregnant women, disabled residents, and patients. To overcome the limitations of using existing non-intelligent, slow-responding, deficient gas sensors, we propose a novel artificial-intelligent-based multiple hazard gas detector (MHGD) system that is mounted on a motor vehicle-based robot which can be remotely controlled. First, we optimized the sensor array for the classification of three hazardous gases, including cigarette smoke, inflammable ethanol, and off-flavor from spoiled food, using an e-nose with a mixing chamber. The mixing chamber can prevent the impact of environmental changes. We compared the classification results of all combinations of sensors, and selected the one with the highest accuracy (98.88%) as the optimal sensor array for the MHGD. The optimal sensor array was then mounted on the MHGD to detect and classify the target gases without a mixing chamber but in a controlled environment. Finally, we tested the MHGD under these conditions, and achieved an acceptable accuracy (70.00%).", "The convergence of operational and information technologies in the industry requires a new generation of IP-compliant communication protocols that can meet the industrial performance requirements while facilitating the integration with novel web-based supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. For more than a decade, the industry has relied on time-slotted channel hopping (TSCH) communication technology to meet these performance requirements through standards such as WirelessHART and ISA100.11a. TSCH-based networks have proven to yield over 99.999% end-to-end reliability, supporting flow isolation and QoS management while ensuring over a decade of battery lifetime. However, these technologies were designed to address the factory use cases of a decade ago, not considering IP compliance or standardized network management and resource orchestration as a must. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the 6TiSCH working group (WG) have been actively working on this challenge by designing protocols to bridge the performance of industrial solutions with IP-compliant networks. The effort has resulted in 6TiSCH, a set of specifications that define the IPv6 control plane to manage and orchestrate a TSCH network. 6TiSCH provides the missing elements for zero-configuration TSCH network bootstrap, efficient network access authentication, and distributed and modular scheduling mechanisms. As a cross-layer effort, 6TiSCH leverages and integrates other IETF specifications and the WG has also driven the definition of novel specifications in other IETF WGs. An ultimate goal of this effort is the definition of a fully functional architecture where a combination of IETF protocols enables the envisioned convergence on top of the IEEE industrial standard. This paper introduces the work done by the 6TiSCH WG at IETF, evaluates the performance of the reference implementation, and discusses the 6TiSCH software ecosystem.", "An increasing number of implementations of IoT for development use the LoRaWAN protocol as many of them leverage the free network and application servers provided by The Things Networks (TTN) to fulfill their needs. Unfortunately, in some countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, Internet access cannot be taken for granted, therefore, TTN might not be available. Moreover, low-cost and low-power consumption options devices are the most sustainable ones. In this paper, we propose a LoRaWAN network with autonomous base stations that can work without Internet connectivity for essential services, while being able to provide additional features whenever Internet access becomes available, even in an intermittent fashion. Security and privacy are preserved, with support for mobile nodes.", "Invasive aquatic plant species can expand rapidly throughout water bodies and cause severely adverse economic and ecological impacts. While mechanical, chemical, and biological methods exist for the identification and treatment of these invasive species, they are manually intensive, inefficient, costly, and can cause collateral ecological damage. To address current deficiencies in aquatic weed management, this paper details the development of a small fleet of fully autonomous boats capable of subsurface hydroacoustic imaging (to scan aquatic vegetation), machine learning (for automated weed identification), and herbicide deployment (for vegetation control). These capabilities aim to minimize manual labor and provide more efficient, safe (reduced chemical exposure to personnel), and timely weed management. Geotagged hydroacoustic imagery of three aquatic plant varieties (Hydrilla, Cabomba, and Coontail) was collected and used to create a software pipeline for subsurface aquatic weed classification and distribution mapping. Employing deep learning, the novel software achieved a classification accuracy of 99.06% after training.", "Being able to perform promptly and accurate emergency calls is crucial for every human life. However, people with impairments feel precluded when there is need to have access to emergency centers. The main reason is the absence of IP-based emergency systems triggered by assistive devices and body area networks. To guarantee that anyone can benefit from emergency systems, it is essential to enable embedded devices to trigger calls to emergency centers and support IP-based real time communication. To achieve this, the present paper extends SEEK framework (Andriopoulou et al., 2018), an embedded framework consisting of environmental, body sensors and a haptic device. SEEK framework enables elderly and disabled people who live independent to perform emergency calls. Sensors embedded in SEEK, aggregate environmental data and vital signs that monitor user's current health status 7and automatically trigger emergency calls when an emergency occurs, providing continuous real-time sensor data. The haptic device provides further modalities to the end user (disabled person or elderly) supporting audio, media and text communication with first responders and healthcare providers at emergency centers. A prototype implementation and initial results are presented as a proof of concept for deaf and speech impaired people enabling them to report emergency events and establish real time communication with first responders. The results depict that even lower capability hardware platforms may be used in order to minimize the cost and increase usability by minimizing power consumption of such an embedded framework.

Localization and labeling of individual rows of plants are performed by a computer vision approach, rather than sophisticated real-time geolocation hardware on the tractor. We evaluate our approach for cropping rows of early-season plants from a Brassica carinata field trial where we achieve 100% recall and 99% precision. We also demonstrate a proof-of-concept plant counting method for our ProTractor system using an object detection network that achieves a mean average precision of 0.82 when detecting plants, and an R-2 of 0.89 when counting plants. The ProTractor design and software are open source to advance the collection of large outdoor plant phenotvping datasets with inexpensive and easy to use acquisition systems.", "In this paper, we present a sonar-based navigation system, designed to deploy a fleet of autonomous mobile platforms at a reasonable cost. In educational and hobbyist contexts, a large number of robots is required. By means of classical navigation approaches, every robot should be provided with accurate vision or range sensors. This limits the maximum number of robots in the fleet, due to the unaffordable cost of these sensors. In contrast to that, our system requires a single platform equipped with a higher quality sensor, used to perform calibration and mapping tasks. The rest of the fleet, able to localize and navigate, is equipped solely with low-cost sonars, providing a notable reduction in the overall cost. We achieve this task by presenting a novel calibration procedure to estimate the sonars extrinsic and adapting a classical monte-carlo localization algorithm to the sonar model, focusing on efficiency. We release an open source implementation of the system to the community.", "An experimental and theoretical study of real-time robot balancing on inclined surfaces with electrical feedback circuitry is presented. Force sensors are experimentally shown to extend the sustainability of a stable robot posture beyond a critical surface inclination. For this purpose, the inclination feedback from the force sensors is used to adjust the robot's ankle-pitch-motor angle above the critical inclination, thus enabling the maintenance of a stable robot posture. Further, the Inverted Pendulum Model (IPM) (Hemami and Golliday, 1977, Hemami et al., 1973, and McGhee and Kuhner, 1969) is extended to the case of inclined surfaces. Through application of this extended IPM it is demonstrated, that simultaneous use of gyro-sensor data can minimize the necessary initial adjustment of the motor angle for controlled robot-body rotation, which additionally has the positive effect of reducing possible overshoots of the motor's rotation angle during feedback. Consequently, the reported feedback control improves the robot-body stability on inclined surfaces. Efficient implementation of the developed control scheme into an existing robot's electrical system is proposed.", "We perform the results implemented via time and data transfer using single-mode optical fiber.

In this work atomic clock has been chosen as primary clock source.", "The main objective of the European Spallation Source (ESS) is to perform consistently high impact neutron scattering science using the highest neutron flux of any facility in its class. This ambition is naturally accompanied by operational challenges related to the vertical integration of the instruments' hardware and software shared between collaborators from 13 European countries. The present work will detail integration tests performed at the V20 Test Instrument at Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin in Germany. An ESS chopper prototype was successfully controlled through the ESS Chopper Integration Controller (CHIC) and Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS). Neutron data were successfully collected and timestamped using neutron beam monitors, the ESS prototype detector readout electronics and the Data Management Software Center (DMSC) data acquisition (DAQ) software. Chopper rotation events were timestamped and the chopper disk showed excellent stability and neutron absorption characteristics. The test resulted in i) the expected time-of-flight (TOF) response, ii) collected data that compared well with instrument reference data and iii) revealing the diagnostic power of the performed integration tests. The results of this integration test validate the ESS chopper and detector DAQ architecture choices.

With access to low-cost sensors and management systems, more farmers are adopting this technology to achieve sustainable growth. However, in literature, there are no simulation platforms to help researchers and users understand sensor deployment, and data collection and processing. In this article, we propose a framework designed to provide a complete farming ecosystem. The toolkit facilitates users to simulate custom farming scenarios, specifically to identify sensor placement, coverage area, line-of-sight deployment, and data gathering through the relay mechanism or airborne systems, mobility models for mobile nodes, energy models for on-ground sensors and airborne vehicles, and backend computing support using the fog computing paradigm. Furthermore, in most of the existing works, network parameters are ignored, which can impact the overall performance of any deployed system. Therefore, the proposed framework also provides a benchmark in terms of transmission delay, packet delivery ratio, energy consumption, and system resources usage.", null, null, "Biohybrid systems integrate living materials with synthetic devices, exploiting their respective advantages to solve challenging engineering problems. One challenge of critical importance to society is detecting and localizing airborne volatile chemicals. Many flying animals depend their ability to detect and locate the source of aerial chemical plumes for finding mates and food sources. A robot with comparable capability could reduce human hazard and drastically improve performance on tasks such as locating disaster survivors, hazardous gas leaks, incipient fires, or explosives. Three advances are needed before they can rival their biological counterparts: (1) a chemical sensor with a much faster response time that nevertheless satisfies the size, weight, and power constraints of flight, (2) a design, sensor suite, and control system that allows it to move toward the source of a plume fully autonomously while navigating obstacles, and (3) the ability to detect the plume with high specificity and sensitivity among the assortment of chemicals that invariably exist in the air. Here we address the first two, introducing a human-safe palm-sized air vehicle equipped with the odor-sensing antenna of an insect, the first odor-sensing biohybrid robot system to fly. Using this sensor along with a suite of additional navigational sensors, as well as passive wind fins, our robot orients upwind and navigates autonomously toward the source of airborne plumes. Our robot is the first flying biohybrid system to successfully perform odor localization in a confined space, and it is able to do so while detecting and avoiding obstacles in its flight path. We show that insect antennae respond more quickly than metal oxide gas sensors, enabling odor localization at an improved speed over previous flying robots. By using the insect antennae, we anticipate a feasible path toward improved chemical specificity and sensitivity by leveraging recent advances in gene editing.", "In this paper, we describe the design considerations and implementation of a smart toy system, a technology for supporting the automatic recording and analysis for detecting developmental delays recognition when children play using the smart toy. To achieve this goal, we take advantage of the current commercial sensor features (reliability, low consumption, easy integration, etc.) to develop a series of sensor-based low-cost devices. Specifically, our prototype system consists of a tower of cubes augmented with wireless sensing capabilities and a mobile computing platform that collect the information sent from the cubes allowing the later analysis by childhood development professionals in order to verify a normal behaviour or to detect a potential disorder. This paper presents the requirements of the toy and discusses our choices in toy design, technology used, selected sensors, process to gather data from the sensors and generate information that will help in the decision-making and communication of the information to the collector system. In addition, we also describe the play activities the system supports.", "Marine processes are observed with sensors from both the ground and space over large spatio-temporal scales. Citizen-based contributions can fill observational gaps and increase environmental stewardship amongst the public. For this purpose, tools and methods for citizen science need to (1) complement existing datasets; and (2) be affordable, while appealing to different user and developer groups. In this article, tools and methods developed in the 7th Framework Programme of European Union (EU FP 7) funded project Citclops (citizens' observatories for coast and ocean optical monitoring) are reviewed. Tools range from a stand-alone smartphone app to devices with Arduino and 3-D printing, and hence are attractive to a diversity of users; from the general public to more specified maker-and open labware movements. Standardization to common water quality parameters and methods allows long-term storage in regular marine data repositories, such as SeaDataNet and EMODnet, thereby providing open data access. Due to the given intercomparability to existing remote sensing datasets, these tools are ready to complement the marine datapool. In the future, such combined satellite and citizen observations may set measurements by the engaged public in a larger context and hence increase their individual meaning. In a wider sense, a synoptic use can support research, management authorities, and societies at large.", "This paper describes implementation of reconfigurable digital down converter in an FPGA structure.

To overcome the above problem, an INS/optical flow/magnetometer integrated navigation scheme is proposed for GPS-denied environment in this paper. The scheme, which is based on extended Kalman filter, combines INS and optical flow information to estimate the velocity and position of MAV. The gyro, accelerator, and magnetometer information are fused together to estimate the MAV attitude when the MAV is at static state or uniformly moving state; and the gyro only is used to estimate the MAV attitude when the MAV is accelerating or decelerating. The MAV flight data is used to verify the proposed integrated navigation scheme, and the verification results show that the proposed scheme can effectively reduce the errors of navigation parameters and improve navigation precision.", "The research area of the compressed baryonic matter - CBM experiment (FAIR/GSI in Darmstadt) is sub-nuclear physics, thus hadron-baryon and quark-gluon, and the essence of phase transitions in the area of hot nuclear matter, and dense strongly interacting matter.

In order to improve MEMS performance, it is proposed to fuse MEMS-IMU information with optical flow, and correct MEMS attitude when it is diverged. Then, image coordinate of optical flow is proposed to be firstly transformed to body one for better vehicle attitude calculation. The Allan variances of MEMS sensors are used in KF filter to replace the regular white noise. The algorithm is finally testified by simulation results, which is shown that vehicle attitude modified by combining with optical flow is of good performance, with smaller error, slow divergence and better robustness.

However, prior studies of this approach have been limited and have not considered a high degree of antenna reconfigurability. This paper uses simulations and experimental measurements to characterize the impact of reconfigurable antenna complexity on the performance of key establishment in different static propagation environments and in the presence of a multi-antenna eavesdropper. The results demonstrate that reconfigurable antennas can significantly enhance the security, even when the eavesdropper antennas are adjacent to or surround one of the legitimate nodes. The results further demonstrate that increasing the number of reconfigurable parasitic elements notably increases the achieved performance.", "Nowadays, we are observing a rapid development of UAV-based monitoring systems, which are faced with more and more new tasks, such as high temporal resolution and high spatial resolution of measurements, or Artificial Intelligence on board. This paper presents the open universal framework intended for fast prototyping or building a short series of specialized flying monitoring systems able to work in urban and industrial areas. The proposed framework combines mobility of UAV with IoT measurements and full-stack WebRTC communications. WebRTC offers simultaneous transmission of both a real-time video stream and the flow of data coming from sensors, and ensures a kind of protection of data flow, which leads to preserving its near-real-time character and enables contextual communication. Addition of the AI accelerator hardware makes this system AI-ready, i.e., the IoT communication hub, which is the air component of our system, is able to perform tasks of AI-supported computing. The exemplary prototype of this system was evaluated in terms of the ability to work with fast-response sensors, the ability to work with high temporal and high spatial resolutions, video information in poor visibility conditions and AI-readiness. Results show that prototypes based on the proposed framework are able to meet the challenges of monitoring systems in smart cities and industrial areas.", "The complexity of heterogenous Systems-on-Chip has overgrown in the last decades, and the effort necessary to set up a verification workflow has increased as well. The time spent on the verification phase of a design takes on average 57% of the project time, and in these years, several solutions aimed to automate that task have been developed. Some relevant works in this field automate the VLSI design flow from synthesis to Place-And-Route and Layout-Vs-Schematic design check but miss software design in the automated verification loop. Our work focuses on the early stages of the design phase, where designers take software and hardware choices to explore a larger design space. In this work, we present a flexible, Make-based framework to build up verification and design environments. It aids the development of Systems-on-Chip running RISC-V processors, automating software compilation, cycle-true simulations and post-synthesis analyses. It exploits the parallelism of the Make build tool to ensure results consistency, provide flow reproducibility, and accelerate the design space exploration using different flow recipes provided by the designer. Its modular structure allows it to perform each task with various third-party tools and makes the workflow execution chain customizable. Using the proposed framework, we show how the reduced designer effort increases design productivity. Indeed, the time needed to build up a validated development environment is consistently reduced by using few configuration properties to setup all the tools used in the workflow.", "Experts have predicted that COVID-19 may prevail for many months or even years before it can be completely eliminated. A major problem in its cure is its early screening and detection, which will decide on its treatment. Due to the fast contactless spreading of the virus, its screening is unusually difficult. Moreover, the results of COVID-19 tests may take up to 48 h. That is enough time for the virus to worsen the health of the affected person. The health community needs effective means for identification of the virus in the shortest possible time. In this study, we invent a medical device utilized consisting of composable sensors to monitor remotely and in real-time the health status of those who have symptoms of the coronavirus or those infected with it. The device comprises wearable medical sensors integrated using the Arduino hardware interfacing and a smartphone application. An IoT framework is deployed at the backend through which various devices can communicate in real-time. The medical device is applied to determine the patient's critical status of the effects of the coronavirus or its symptoms using heartbeat, cough, temperature and Oxygen concentration (SpO2) that are evaluated using our custom algorithm. Until now, it has been found that many coronavirus patients remain asymptomatic, but in case of known symptoms, a person can be quickly identified with our device. It also allows doctors to examine their patients without the need for physical direct contact with them to reduce the possibility of infection. Our solution uses rule-based decision-making based on the physiological data of a person obtained through sensors. These rules allow to classify a person as healthy or having a possibility of infection by the coronavirus. The advantage of using rules for patient's classification is that the rules can be updated as new findings emerge from time to time. In this article, we explain the details of the sensors, the smartphone application, and the associated IoT framework for real-time, remote screening of COVID-19.", "This paper applies depth images and a 3D simulation to introduce a safety system for manufacturing facilities. Smart systems have recently become an important topic for use in the manufacturing industry, and these are now being developed with newly-introduced A.I.-based technologies. Smart manufacturing systems introduced with A.I. enable more efficient production than before, but these offer limited improvements at first. To further enhance production, collaborative intelligence can combine human creativity with the speed and accuracy of the equipment, complementing the shortcomings of each production method. However, collaboration in existing facilities requires new safety measures for workers because there is a higher propensity for accidents due to collisions. A recent study on worker-equipment collisions has shortcomings in that a collision between workers and equipment is inevitable because whether or not a collision occurs with a worker is checked only by using a sensor inside the robot. Therefore, this study installs a depth image camera outside the equipment, not a sensor inside, and the system can produce simulations in advance in a virtual environment before finalizing the design of the operation and equipment. A comparison of a simulation to the actual movement of a robot arm toward the point of collision with a worker confirmed an error of about 10.048 cm. Through this, it is possible to detect worker-equipment collision in advance.", ["For quality, interpretation, reproducibility and sharing value, microscopy images should be accompanied by detailed descriptions of the conditions that were used to produce them.

Its main goal is to provide a low-cost solution capable of supporting proof-of-concept implementations and rapid prototyping methodologies for both consumer and industrial IoT markets. AGILE allows developers to implement and deliver a complete (software and hardware) IoT solution for managing non-IP IoT devices through a multi-service gateway. Moreover, it simplifies the access of startups to the IoT market, not only providing an efficient and cost-effective solution for industries but also allowing end-users to customize and extend it according to their specific requirements. This flexibility is the result of the joint experience of established organizations in the project consortium already promoting the principles of openness, both at the software and hardware levels.

Since its inception in the 90s, the Object Linking and Embedding for Process Control (OPC) protocol has provided open connectivity for monitoring and automation systems. It has been widely used in several environments such as industrial facilities, building and energy automation, engineering education and many others. This paper presents a novel OPC-based architecture to implement automation systems devoted to R&D and educational activities. The proposal is a novel conceptual framework, structured into four functional layers where the diverse components are categorized aiming to foster the systematic design and implementation of automation systems involving OPC communication. Due to the benefits of OPC, the proposed architecture provides features like open connectivity, reliability, scalability, and flexibility. Furthermore, four successful experimental applications of such an architecture, developed at the University of Extremadura (UEX), are reported. These cases are a proof of concept of the ability of this architecture to support interoperability for different domains. Namely, the automation of energy systems like a smart microgrid and photobioreactor facilities, the implementation of a network-accessible industrial laboratory and the development of an educational hardware-in-the-loop platform are described. All cases include a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) to automate and control the plant behavior, which exchanges operative data (measurements and signals) with a multiplicity of sensors, instruments and supervisory systems under the structure of the novel OPC architecture.

This approach is refined here to develop a novel instrument capable of performing automated large-area four-point probe measurements. The designs for conversion of a RepRap 3-D printer to a 2-D open source four-point probe (OS4PP) measurement device are detailed for the mechanical and electrical systems. Free and open source software and firmware are developed to operate the tool. The OS4PP was validated against a wide range of discrete resistors and indium tin oxide (ITO) samples of different thicknesses both pre- and post-annealing. The OS4PP was then compared to two commercial proprietary systems. Results of resistors from 10 to 1 M show errors of less than 1% for the OS4PP. The 3-D mapping of sheet resistance of ITO samples successfully demonstrated the automated capability to measure non-uniformities in large-area samples. The results indicate that all measured values are within the same order of magnitude when compared to two proprietary measurement systems. In conclusion, the OS4PP system, which costs less than 70% of manual proprietary systems, is comparable electrically while offering automated 100 micron positional accuracy for measuring sheet resistance over larger areas.", "Air pollution monitoring has recently become an issue of utmost importance in our society. Despite the fact that crowdsensing approaches could be an adequate solution for urban areas, they cannot be implemented in rural environments. Instead, deploying a fleet of UAVs could be considered an acceptable alternative. Embracing this approach, this paper proposes the use of UAVs equipped with off-the-shelf sensors to perform air pollution monitoring tasks. These UAVs are guided by our proposed Pollution-driven UAV Control (PdUC) algorithm, which is based on a chemotaxis metaheuristic and a local particle swarm optimization strategy. Together, they allow automatically performing the monitoring of a specified area using UAVs. Experimental results show that, when using PdUC, an implicit priority guides the construction of pollution maps by focusing on areas where the pollutants' concentration is higher. This way, accurate maps can be constructed in a faster manner when compared to other strategies. The PdUC scheme is compared against various standard mobility models through simulation, showing that it achieves better performance. In particular, it is able to find the most polluted areas with more accuracy and provides a higher coverage within the time bounds defined by the UAV flight time.", "In this article, we develop a programmatic notion of innovation ecosystems, which emphasizes the analysis of different forms of distributed innovation without reducing the perspective to the role of a focal organization. It highlights relationships between communities and corporate firms as nexus for distributed innovation and elaborates how different facets of openness shape the dynamic of the ecosystem. Thus, our model allows for the analysis and comparison of a broad scope of constellations, their particular coordinating mechanisms as well as related advantages and disadvantages. We apply this framework to two specific cases of distributed innovation, the RepRap 3D printer and the ARA modular smartphone, in order to delineate how differences in the forms of openness affect the prevalent relationships between communities and firms as well as the constituting functions of their particular innovation ecosystem.", "Software for computer animation is generally characterized by a steep learning curve, due to the entanglement of both sophisticated techniques and interaction methods required to control 3D geometries. This paper proposes a tool designed to support computer animation production processes by leveraging the affordances offered by articulated tangible user interfaces and motion capture retargeting solutions. To this aim, orientations of an instrumented prop are recorded together with animator's motion in the 3D space and used to quickly pose characters in the virtual environment. High-level functionalities of the animation software are made accessible via a speech interface, thus letting the user control the animation pipeline via voice commends while focusing on his or her hands and body motion. The proposed solution exploits both off-the-shelf hardware components (like the Lego Mindstorms EV3 bricks and the Microsoft Kinect, used for building the tangible device and tracking animator's skeleton) and free open-source software (like the Blender animation tool), thus representing an interesting solution also for beginners approaching the world of digital animation for the first time.

Part of the planning process, is forecasting the peak load for a geographical area with a given load class composition. This forecast is used to plan the capacity and timeline of infrastructure to service that area. In this paper, an overview of the GLF peak load estimation technique is provided as background. A Monte Carlo simulation based approach to evaluate the accuracy of this method was developed and is presented. Using the simulation, an evaluation of the current method and load library was completed and the results show that the current method significantly under-estimates the peak load. This can be attributed to changes in the load profile shapes of customers since 2007 when the current load profile library was derived, as well as simplifications in the derivation of the customer load behaviour. Specifically, the differences between the load behaviours of customers within a specific load class is ignored. An enhancement to the geo-based method is presented and compares well with simulated results across different customer classes and load aggregation periods. This improvement reflects the customer load behaviour more accurately and can readily be incorporated as part of the distribution master planning process.", "To simulate the cardiac niche, a bioreactor system was designed and constructed to incorporate cyclic stretch, rhythmic electrical stimulation, and constant perfusion. The homogeneity of surface strain distribution across the cell culture substrate was confirmed with ARAMIS deformation analysis. The proliferation marker, Ki-67, detected in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and 3-[4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide cytotoxicity assay performed on human atrial fibroblasts confirmed biocompatibility of this novel device. Cyclic stretch treatment for 24 h resulted in the perpendicular alignment of human atrial fibroblasts. An electrical stimulation system containing carbon electrodes was characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and charge injection/recovery studies, which indicated that increased corrosive reactions were associated with a higher input voltage and prolonged pulse duration.

We developed a low-cost (similar to US$56), open-source, customizable inline pressure sensor system with operational flexibility and simple data logging. Most pressure sensors are expensive, not customizable, specific to a single tubing size, provide only analog readings, have poor stability and precision, or are incomplete without a data logger. These issues limit the usefulness of such hardware. Our system addresses all of these concerns. The customizability of both the hardware and firmware (via options or code modification) allows for the device to be tailored easily to each application. Tubing diameter, adapter dimensions, sensor used, logging behavior, and integration with other systems can be configured with ease. Much of the practicality and configurability of the software and hardware arise from the use of our Loom code and ecosystem.

First, our approach utilizes the virtualization framework trap mechanism and precisely intercepts intercomponent interactions with no need to check every data access, but effectively maintains deterministic chronological orders of intercomponent interactions. Second, VIRA provides very accurate system performance estimation for early system-level designs through effective integration of component timing models, interrupt effects, and bus contention analysis. Third, VIRA achieves near-real-time performance by having software and hardware simulated components executed on the same host machine to minimize the overhead of intercomponent data exchange. We implement the proposed approach on a virtualization-enabled off-the-shelf system-on-chip board to demonstrate the effectiveness of our idea. The experiments show that VIRA always produces deterministic results while running 58-625 times faster than a commercial tool, and the system performance estimation is only 3%-6% from real systems. Moreover, our deterministic full-system simulator is also verified to carry as little as 2%-57% overhead compared to ideal native executions on the same host hardware devices.", "When discussing maker culture, much attention is dedicated to how making can be beneficial for specific fields (e.g. healthcare, education) or various communities of makers (e.g. educators, crafters). The democratic ideal of personal fabrication and the maker culture movement - represented by the growth of open makerspaces (e.g. FabLabs, makerspaces) and online communities (e.g. 'Instructables', 'Thingiverse') worldwide - provides everyone with the opportunity to make (almost) anything. However, structurally engaging non-expert users still remains an important challenge for most open makerspaces. Therefore, this article focuses on the potential of open makerspaces for communities and - more specifically - how to involve nonexpert users in these open makerspaces. Framed within the fields of Participatory Design and infrastructuring, this article presents two case studies ` Hack-a-thing' and 'Making Things' - that are part of a long-term participation process of engaging local non-expert users in FabLab Genk. In these cases, the involved non-expert users entailed teenagers, children and their supervisors (for instance, supervisors involved in participating youth organisations). The case studies show that building relations with existing communities of non-expert users and creating conditions for them to self-organise their activities within open makerspaces are essential starting points for processes of long-term engagement.", "Water resource managers and scientists have recognized the need for data at spatial and temporal resolutions relevant to the hydrological cycle. The dearth of hydrological data sets has been noted as a critical barrier to developing effective water resource management strategies. Limited funding has been noted as a major contributing factor to the limited establishment of sustainable environmental monitoring networks to capture these data sets. To address these concerns, an inexpensive real-time hydrological monitoring station (RTHS) was designed to collect data with similar performance to existing commercially available sensors. The RTHS was built with both commercially available and custom-engineered components, using enabling technology to reduce capital and operations and maintenance costs. The RTHS incorporated a modular design for easy integration of multiple sensors and implementation of upgrades with less expensive and more reliable components as emerging technologies become available. Inexpensive stage height, water temperature, and all-season precipitation sensors were designed, fabricated, and tested in house. Integration of components into a comprehensive hydrological monitoring system required custom hardware designs and software routines. Controlled laboratory and field evaluations with a colocated research-grade sensor indicated that the designed precipitation gauge provides a low-cost alternative with comparable performance to commercially available off-the-shelf sensors.

The performance of UAV-system components such as inertial navigation sensors, propulsion, control processors and algorithms are gradually improving. Simultaneously, lidar technologies are continuously developing in terms of reliability, accuracy, as well as speed of data collection, storage and processing. The lidar development towards miniature systems with high data rates has, together with recent UAV development, a great potential for new three dimensional (3D) mapping capabilities. Compared to lidar mapping from manned full-size aircraft a small unmanned aircraft can be cost efficient over small areas and more flexible for deployment. An advantage with high resolution lidar compared to 3D mapping from passive (multi angle) photogrammetry is the ability to penetrate through vegetation and detect partially obscured targets. Another advantage is the ability to obtain 3D data over the whole survey area, without the limited performance of passive photogrammetry in low contrast areas. The purpose of our work is to demonstrate 3D lidar mapping capability from a small multirotor UAV. We present the first experimental results and the mechanical and electrical integration of the Velodyne HDL-32E lidar on a six-rotor aircraft with a total weight of 7 kg. The rotating lidar is mounted at an angle of 20 degrees from the horizontal plane giving a vertical field-of-view of 10-50 degrees below the horizon in the aircraft forward directions. For absolute positioning of the 3D data, accurate positioning and orientation of the lidar sensor is of high importance. We evaluate the lidar data position accuracy both based on inertial navigation system (INS) data, and on INS data combined with lidar data. The INS sensors consist of accelerometers, gyroscopes, GPS, magnetometers, and a pressure sensor for altimetry. The lidar range resolution and accuracy is documented as well as the capability for target surface reflectivity estimation based on measurements on calibration standards.

We propose that the physical changes in the medium of propagation can be measured precisely by the ultra-high precision measurement of the signal. We provide evidence to our proposition by verifying the Newton's law of cooling by measuring the effect of change in temperature on the phase and amplitude of the signals propagating through two calibrated cables.

Agriculture depends a lot on the source and supply of water and that becomes a major issue in places which rely solely on the monsoons as their primary source of water, since the monsoons are not evenly distributed all over the country every year. In such cases, the scheduled watering of the crops can get hampered, and that might in turn hamper the quality and quantity of crops produced. To overcome this problem, the proposed smart irrigation system can be employed in the field of agriculture.

This flexibility allows researchers to study and record agile cetaceans which can exhibit unpredictable swimming behaviors, such as Omura's whales (Balaenoptera omurai). However, purpose built sUASs can be prohibitively expensive, require specialized expertise to operate, and require resources not available to many field biologists. Large multirotor aircrafts can require significant time and space for launch and recovery, and the vehicle can pose a hazard to those operating in its vicinity. By comparison, consumer grade unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, continue to become increasingly inexpensive, reliable, and compact. We tested seven commercially available UAV products from five leading consumer drone manufacturers and gauged their ability to be used at sea and for cetacean photogrammetry. These preliminary experiments informed our selection of equipment which we trialed during a targeted field expedition off the coast of Nosy Be, Madagascar. Over the course of a three week survey, we compared the efficacy of a consumer grade, off-the-shelf UAV with a custom solution of comparable size and price. Both sUASs were successfully able to collect data which translated to animal size measurements. We provide both specific guidelines for selecting, testing, and calibrating consumer grade UAVs to be used on ocean-based expeditions, as well as procedures for conducting morphometric analyses with the resulting data.

The medium access control (MAC) has thus been largely investigated over the last fifteen years. Unfortunately, classical contention access methods use a random access and are unable to provide guarantees.

Slow channel hopping allows each node to use different channels for a frame and its possible retransmissions with a low-cost hardware. To provide high-reliability, these protocols rely on a common schedule in order to prevent simultaneously interfering transmissions. In this context, we clearly observe a strong growth of the number of proposals in the last years, denoting a strong interest of the research community for deterministic slow channel hopping scheduling for the IIoT.

In each section and in the end current challenges are discussed for future research work.", "This paper reports on the design and implementation of an open-source library of parameterizable and reusable Hardware Description Language (HDL) Intellectual Property (IP) cores designed for the development of Software-Defined Radio (SDR) applications that are deployed on FPGA-based reconfigurable computing platforms. The library comprises a set of cores that were chosen, together with their parameters and interfacing schemas, based on recommendations from industry and academic SDR experts. The operation of the SDR cores is first validated and then benchmarked against two other cores libraries of a similar type to show that our cores do not take much more logic elements than existing cores and that they support a comparable maximum clock speed. Finally, we propose our design for a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) and supporting tool-flow, which we are in the process of building using our SDR library and the Delite DSL framework. We intend to take this DSL and supporting framework further to provide a rapid prototyping system for SDR application development to programmers not experienced in HDL coding. We conclude with a summary of the main characteristics of our SDR library and reflect on how our DSL tool-flow could assist other developers working in SDR field.", "Emerging network services and subsequent growth in the networking infrastructure have gained tremendous momentum in recent years. Application performance requiring rapid real-time network provisioning, optimized traffic management, and virtualization of shared resources has induced the conceptualization and adoption of new networking models. Software defined networking (SDN), one of the predominant and relatively new networking paradigms, seeks to simplify network management by decoupling network control logic from the underlying hardware and introduces real-time network programmability enabling innovation. The present work reviews the state of the art in software defined networking providing a historical perspective on complementary technologies in network programmability and the inherent shortcomings which paved the way for SDN. The SDN architecture is discussed along with popular protocols, platforms, and existing simulation and debugging solutions. Furthermore, a detailed analysis is presented around recent SDN development and deployment avenues ranging from mobile communications and data centers to campus networks and residential environments. The review concludes by highlighting implementation challenges and subsequent research directions being pursued in academia and industry to address issues related to application performance, control plane scalability and design, security, and interdomain connectivity in the context of SDN.", "Distributed manufacturing, where decentralized small, local sites are engaged in production, often supported by digital systems and networks, can be a powerful tool in humanitarian aid. Field Ready uses distributed manufacturing to produce essential non-food items locally where they are needed during humanitarian responses. Such supplies can be available to communities in need and to relief workers more quickly, more cheaply than alternatives, and provide appropriate solutions to problems, often engaging local people in designing and making necessary items, and supporting economic development. Scaling up this requires local production capabilities (skills, tools, and information such as designs), which can be boosted by adoption of these methods by aid agencies, international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) and others. Local manufacturing offers the potential for disaster affected communities to be engaged in recovery, and long term to become more resilient, with access to all the equipment and information required to make the supplies they need. However, there are challenges: appropriate quality control for distributed manufacture, unlocking the potential for in-region manufacturers to engage in humanitarian response, and uptake of digital knowledge sharing and collaboration to the humanitarian sector. In this paper, we share experiences of human-centred design and global collaboration to solve local problems, of manufacturing in remote and challenging locations, community building and bridging sectors through the Humanitarian Makers network, and new ideas for distributed manufacturing standards and quality.", "For an industry 4.0 environment, the management and offering of services, falls over the construction of a stable and reliable sensor and actuator infrastructure. Industry 4.0 is undergoing increase advancement, infrastructure availability and public acceptance, mainly boosted by the Interconnected Things. The public acceptance drives an increase on investments, carrying an insurgence of companies competing with each other to gain market. Although lessening costs, this insurgence has brought heterogeneous infrastructures and solutions availability, challenging services providers. Among the challenges the security and different technology solutions support are of the most importance. The scattering of solutions and software code have to be conveniently gathered to avoid weak-points, eventually, a menace to be explored by hackers. This paper is a contribution in order to embraces those challenges in a new architecture framework able of supporting the creation of solutions for Smart Grid and Smart Living services providers under the industry 4.0 paradigm. The architecture framework design offers security, simplicity of implementation and maintenance, and is resilient to failures or attacks and technologically independent. Field tests are reported in order to evaluate key aspects of the proposed architecture. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In Parkinson's disease, a disease-specific physiomarker was identified that is now used to investigate adaptive closed-loop stimulation in first studies. In dystonia, such a physiomarker is missing.", "MethodsPallidal oscillations were recorded from 153 contact pairs in 27 patients. We investigated whether power amplitudes in theta and beta bands correlate with dystonic symptom severity across patients. We then projected theta power from each contact pair onto standard subcortical anatomy. In this way, we defined a theta hot spot on a group level and investigated whether proximity of the active DBS contacts to it correlated with clinical improvement.", "ResultsDystonic symptom severity significantly correlated with theta but not beta oscillatory amplitudes (=0.4, p=0.009) and interhemispheric coherence (=0.5, p=0.002). The sweet spot of theta activity localized to the posterior third of the internal pallidum and theta power correlated with proximity to this location (=0.23, p=0.002), which coincided with 3 previously published coordinates describing optimal stimulation targets. Finally, motor improvement through pallidal long-term DBS correlated with theta peak amplitude (=0.38, p=0.018).", "InterpretationOur findings suggest that theta oscillations in the internal pallidum are robustly associated with dystonic symptoms in cervical dystonia and may be a useful biomarker for adaptive closed-loop stimulation. Furthermore, theta oscillatory activity may have a predictive value for the clinical benefit after chronic DBS that could be used to improve intraoperative neurophysiological target mapping during electrode implantation.

Concerning demand side factors the paper demonstrates how potential market size and existing technology trajectory work in favor of IoT diffusion. As a related demand side factor the paper argues that, in terms of the technological trajectory, China has started farther from the frontier than most industrialized countries. The degree of incremental benefit from the IoT is thus higher in the country. As to the supply side factors, the article promotes an understanding of how Chinese technology companies have capitalized on a huge user base to develop IoT-based applications. It also suggests that technologies and expertise provided by foreign multinationals have also played crucial roles. Regarding formal institutions, the government's proactive policies have been a major factor in the IoT's evolution. It is also in the Chinese government's interest to develop IoT products to make censorship and surveillance more effective. Regarding informal institutions, Chinese consumers are less concerned than Westerners about being tracked and monitored, which provides a favorable condition for the adoption of IoT-enabled devices. Nonetheless, this condition is changing due to increasing abuse of consumer privacy. China and the U.S. are compared in terms of diffusion, key determinants, performance indicators and impacts of the IoT in order to understand the areas that China outperforms-and underperform-the U.S. Some indicators are proposed to gauge the IoT-related performance and the impacts of the IoT.", "An approach to intelligent building energy management systems at the workplace level has the potential to save energy through the use of building information modeling (BIM) and smart sensor systems. Its development focuses on micro-climatization and real-time digitalization systems from an architect's point of view. Intelligent management systems (IMSs) have significant potential for energy savings, but they have not been fully used in buildings and cities. Smart sensor systems based on user behavior will improve indoor environmental quality (IEQ) and user comfort. A cost-effective strategy has been implemented by using a low-technology and high-performance approach. This work aims to reduce energy consumption and provide comfort conditions by learning user behavior. Furthermore, it seeks to create a real-time system with regard to the functions of developed technologies. In order to improve energy efficiency and comfort conditions, smart sensor systems and digital simulation tools play a crucial role in finding optimal solutions to optimization problems.

The global community of makerspaces has evolved quickly and in turn, substantial hype is attributed to its potential for radical sustainable innovation. In this article, we explore this potential in the context of the new 'circular economy' agenda. We focus the research on the critical role of makerspace managers/founders who are recognised as gatekeepers to circular practices. The research method is action-led including expert interviews (academics and founders/managers) as well as two generative context-mapping workshops, run at selected makerspaces in collaboration with their founders/managers. We unearth everyday 'how-to' guidance to interweave circular practices within makerspaces from the outset by: fostering an enabling culture; building local connections; nurturing individual/community capacities; and stimulating practical know-how. However, while the research reveals immense opportunities to cultivate circular literacy from within makerspaces, the prospects to ask more profound questions about our economy, through makerspace practices, are found to be compromised by day-today concerns. The insights from this research can act as a starting point for future work in this emerging research area.", "Robotics technology and the increasing sophistication of artificial intelligence are breakthrough innovations with significant growth prospects. They have the potential to disrupt existing socio-economic facets of everyday life. Yet few studies have analysed the development of robotics innovation. This paper closes this gap by analysing current developments in innovation in robotics; how it is diffused, and what role is played by intellectual property (IP). The paper argues that robotics clusters are mainly located in the US and Europe, despite a growing presence in South Korea and China. The robotics innovation ecosystem builds on cooperative networks of actors, including individuals, research institutions, and firms. Governments play a significant role in supporting robotics innovation through funding, military demand, and national robotics strategies. Robotics competitions and prizes provide an important incentive for innovation. Patents are used to exclude third parties to secure freedom of operation, license technologies, and avoid litigation. The countries with the highest number of patent claims arc Japan, China, South Korea, and the US. The growing stock of patents owned by universities and PROs, particularly in China, is noteworthy too. Automotive and electronics companies are still the largest patent filers, but medical technologies and the Internet are emerging as new actors in the field. Secrecy is often used as a tool to appropriate innovation. Copyright protection is relevant to robotics also, mainly for its role in protecting software. Finally, open-source robotics platforms are increasingly used in the early stages of the innovation process as they allow new actors in the robotics field to optimize their initial spending on innovation.", "Industry is building larger, more complex, manycore processors on the back of strong institutional knowledge, but academic projects face difficulties in replicating that scale. To alleviate these difficulties and to develop and share knowledge, the community needs open architecture frameworks for simulation, synthesis, and software exploration which support extensibility, scalability, and configurability, alongside an established base of verification tools and supported software. In this paper we present OpenPiton, an open source framework for building scalable architecture research prototypes from 1 core to 500 million cores. OpenPiton is the world's first open source, general-purpose, multithreaded manycore processor and framework. OpenPiton leverages the industry hardened OpenSPARC T1 core with modifications and builds upon it with a scratch-built, scalable uncore creating a flexible, modern manycore design. In addition, OpenPiton provides synthesis and backend scripts for ASIC and FPGA to enable other researchers to bring their designs to implementation. OpenPiton provides a complete verification infrastructure of over 8000 tests, is supported by mature software tools, runs full-stack multiuser Debian Linux, and is written in industry standard Verilog. Multiple implementations of OpenPiton have been created including a taped-out 25-core implementation in IBM's 32nm process and multiple Xilinx FPGA prototypes.", "This paper addresses the landing problem of a vertical take-off and landing vehicle, exemplified by a quadrotor, on a moving platform using image-based visual servo control. Observable features on a flat and textured target plane are exploited to derive a suitable control law. The target plane may be moving with bounded linear acceleration in any direction. For control purposes, the image of the centroid for a collection of landmarks is used as position measurement, whereas the translational optical flow is used as velocity measurement. The proposed control law guarantees convergence to the desired landing spot on the target plane, without estimating any parameter related to the unknown height, which is also guaranteed to remain strictly positive. Moreover, convergence is guaranteed even in the presence of bounded and possibly time-varying disturbances, resulting, for example, from the motion of the target plane, measurement errors, or wind-induced force disturbances. To improve performance, an estimator for unknown constant force disturbances is also included in the control law. Simulation and experimental results are provided to illustrate and assess the performance of the proposed controller.", "The Detector Control System of the CMS Electromagnetic Calorimeter has undergone significant improvements during the first LHC Long Shutdown. Based on the experience acquired during the first period of physics data taking of the LHC, several hardware projects were carried out to improve data accuracy, to minimise the impact of failures and to extend remote control possibilities in order to accelerate recovery from problematic situations. This paper outlines the hardware of the detector control and safety systems and explains in detail the requirements, design and commissioning of the new hardware projects.", "The bandwidth and latency requirements of next-generation datacenter networks stress the limits of CMOS manufacturing. A key trend in their design will be a move from single-channel links and switches to multi-channel links and switches. Today's network topologies erase this distinction, providing the illusion of a unified network fabric. In this work we propose P-FatTree, which is a FatTree topology designed specifically for the future multi-channel reality. P-FatTree requires fewer switch chips and as a result has lower cost, power consumption, and latency than existing approaches. Furthermore, by embracing the parallel nature of the network itself, it enables compelling new ways to better manage and deliver application traffic.", "Globally, analog television platforms are in steady decline, while digital platforms proliferate. This shift has considerable socio-economic and cultural implications that are too often ignored by the existing economic and political economy literatures. This article surveys key patterns in the adoption of digital platforms across Europe, and finds, based on an array of quantitative metrics, apparently contradictory trends. We observe, on one hand, the rise of closed TV platforms as the paradigmatic commercial model of the new media landscape; but on the other, the cultural and material openness of the Internet, which is radically transforming the consumption of television. While hybrid arrangements abound, industry solutions are still awkwardly matched to consumer preferences. Without drawing too sharp a line between technology and culture, the article presents an overview of the many ways the changing meaning of digital platforms continues to shape the global television industry.

This paper overviews an approach to the inspection problem based on an autonomous Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) which, as part of this fleet, is in charge of regularly supplying images that can teleport the surveyor from a base station to the areas of the hull to be inspected. The control software approach adopted for the MAV is fully described, with a special emphasis on the self-localization capabilities of the vehicle. Experimental results showing the suitability of the platform to the application are as well reported and discussed.", "A revised model that estimates the load profiles for residential consumers in South Africa was developed and is described in this paper. Through the NRS 034 domestic load research programme a large number of load profiles of residential consumers from various Living Standards Measure (ie LSM) classes were collected. The load profiles are further described by a set of socio demographic indicators which is obtained through a front-door survey. A model that relates the hourly customer load profiles to household income, time electrified and region was developed and the output may be used in various planning activities, e.g. electrification design, network expansion planning, long term load forecasting etc. This analysis covers all data collected to end of 2011. A software implementation of the model is available which allows the user to obtain estimates of hourly profiles for different months given a set of input parameters.", "To simulate the cardiac niche, a bioreactor system was designed and constructed to incorporate cyclic stretch, rhythmic electrical stimulation, and constant perfusion. The homogeneity of surface strain distribution across the cell culture substrate was confirmed with ARAMIS deformation analysis. The proliferation marker, Ki-67, detected in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and 3-[4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide cytotoxicity assay performed on human atrial fibroblasts confirmed biocompatibility of this novel device. Cyclic stretch treatment for 24 h resulted in the perpendicular alignment of human atrial fibroblasts. An electrical stimulation system containing carbon electrodes was characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and charge injection/recovery studies, which indicated that increased corrosive reactions were associated with a higher input voltage and prolonged pulse duration. Field stimulation delivered through this system could induce rhythmic contractions in adult rat ventricular myocytes, with contractile characteristics similar to those paced in a standard field stimulation chamber. In conclusion, this bioreactor provides a novel tool to study the interaction between physical stimulation and cardiac cell physiology.", "In this paper, solutions for precise maneuvering of an autonomous small (e.g., 350-class) Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are designed and implemented from smart modifications of non expensive mass market technologies. The considered class of vehicles suffers from light load, and, therefore, only a limited amount of sensors and computing devices can be installed on-board. Then, to make the prototype capable of moving autonomously along a fixed trajectory, a \"cyber-pilot\", able on demand to replace the human operator, has been implemented on an embedded control board. This cyber-pilot overrides the commands thanks to a custom hardware signal mixer. The drone is able to localize itself in the environment without ground assistance by using a camera possibly mounted on a 3 Degrees Of Freedom (DOF) gimbal suspension. A computer vision system elaborates the video stream pointing out land markers with known absolute position and orientation. This information is fused with accelerations from a 6-DOF Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to generate a \"virtual sensor\" which provides refined estimates of the pose, the absolute position, the speed and the angular velocities of the drone. Due to the importance of this sensor, several fusion strategies have been investigated. The resulting data are, finally, fed to a control algorithm featuring a number of uncoupled digital PID controllers which work to bring to zero the displacement from the desired trajectory.", "Background: Electrophysiology has a wide range of biomedical research and clinical applications. As such, education in the theoretical basis and hands-on practice of electrophysiological techniques is essential for biomedical students, including at the undergraduate level. However, offering hands-on learning experiences is particularly difficult in environments with limited resources and infrastructure. Methods: In 2017, we began a project to design and incorporate electrophysiology laboratory practicals into our Biomedical Physics undergraduate curriculum at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico. We describe some of the challenges we faced, how we maximized resources to overcome some of these challenges, and in particular, how we used open scholarship approaches to build both educational and research capacity. Results: We succeeded in developing a number of experimental and data analysis practicals in electrophysiology, including electrocardiogram, electromyogram, and electrooculogram techniques. The use of open tools, open platforms, and open licenses was key to the success and broader impact of our project. We share examples of our practicals and explain how we use these activities to strengthen interdisciplinary learning, namely the application of concepts in physics to understanding functions of the human body. Conclusions: Open scholarship provides multiple opportunities for universities to build capacity. Our goal is to provide ideas, materials, and strategies for educators working in similar resource-limited environments.", "Internet of Things (IoT) refers to uniquely identifiable entities. Its vision is the world of connected objects. Due to its connected nature the data produced by IoT is being used for different purposes. Since IoT generates huge amount of data, we need some scalable storage to store and compute the data sensed from the sensors. To overcome this issue, we need the integration of cloud and IoT, so that the data might be stored and computed in a scalable environment. Harmonization of IoT in Cloud might be a novel solution in this regard. IoT devices will interact with each other using Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). In this paper, we have implemented harmonizing IoT in Cloud. We have used CoAP to get things connected to each other through the Internet. For the implementation we have used two sensors, fire detector and the sensor attached with the door which is responsible for opening it. Thus our implementation will be storing and retrieving the sensed data from the cloud. We have also compared our implementation with different parameters. The comparison shows that our implementation significantly improves the performance compared to the existing system.", "Due to the huge surge in the traffic of IoT devices and applications, mobile networks require a new paradigm shift to handle such demand roll out. With the 5G economics, those networks should provide virtualized multi-vendor and intelligent systems that can scale and efficiently optimize the investment of the underlying infrastructure. Therefore, the market stakeholders have proposed the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) as one of the solutions to improve the network performance, agility, and time-to-market of new applications. O-RAN harnesses the power of artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and new network technologies (NFV and SDN) to allow operators to manage their infrastructure in a cost-efficient manner. Therefore, it is necessary to address the O-RAN performance and availability challenges autonomously while maintaining the quality of service. In this work, we propose an optimized deployment strategy for the virtualized O-RAN units in the O-Cloud to minimize the network's outage while complying with the performance and operational requirements. The model's evaluation provides an optimal deployment strategy that maximizes the network's overall availability and adheres to the O-RAN-specific requirements.", "This paper presents the Mechanical Ventilator Milano (MVM), a novel intensive therapy mechanical ventilator designed for rapid, large-scale, low-cost production for the COVID-19 pandemic. Free of moving mechanical parts and requiring only a source of compressed oxygen and medical air to operate, the MVM is designed to support the long-term invasive ventilation often required for COVID-19 patients and operates in pressure-regulated ventilation modes, which minimize the risk of furthering lung trauma. The MVM was extensively tested against ISO standards in the laboratory using a breathing simulator, with good agreement between input and measured breathing parameters and performing correctly in response to fault conditions and stability tests. The MVM has obtained Emergency Use Authorization by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in healthcare settings during the COVID-19 pandemic and Health Canada Medical Device Authorization for Importation or Sale, under Interim Order for Use in Relation to COVID-19. Following these certifications, mass production is ongoing and distribution is under way in several countries. The MVM was designed, tested, prepared for certification, and mass produced in the space of a few months by a unique collaboration of respiratory healthcare professionals and experimental physicists, working with industrial partners, and is an excellent ventilator candidate for this pandemic anywhere in the world.", "The field of microfluidics has progressed rapidly over the last few decades as an essential tool in many areas of experimental research that involve tiny liquid volumes. However, the fast-growing field relies heavily on specialized fabrication facilities and research equipment, which limits the active participation of researchers and beginners outside microfluidics. With the growing paradigm on do-it-yourself (DIY) biology and open-source (OS) hardware, there are many efforts to create microfluidic products by using publicly-shared or easy-to-use principles. Although this approach to technology innovation has already been initiated in the field of microfluidics, the literature on OS and DIY microfluidics is still disseminated in individual journals. In this review, we provide an overview of OS and DIY microfluidics and related technologies, in particular, how microfluidic devices can be fabricated without specialized manufacturing equipment and microfabrication facilities, and how laboratory equipment that is required to perform microfluidics research can be recreated to be affordable and customizable without specialized expertise. Thus, this review introduces subtractive and additive micromachining technologies such as laser cutting, milling, and 3D printing that are accessible even to beginners, and compare their pros and cons for microfabrication. Then, OS and DIY instruments essential for operation of microfluidic devices including precision pumps, microscopes, and centrifuges are reviewed. We discuss the challenges associated with the more-accessible, wide-spread use of microfluidics as well as potential strategies to address these challenges, which can lead to individual- and community-driven microfluidics innovation.", "Bird damage to fruit crops causes significant monetary losses to farmers annually. The application of traditional bird repelling methods such as bird cannons and tree netting become inefficient in the long run, requiring high maintenance and reducing mobility. Due to their versatility, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be beneficial to solve this problem. However, due to their low battery capacity that equals low flight duration, it is necessary to evolve path planning optimization. A novel path planning optimization algorithm of UAVs based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is presented in this paper. This path planning optimization algorithm aims to manage the drone's distance and flight time, applying optimization and randomness techniques to overcome the disadvantages of the traditional systems. The proposed algorithm's performance was tested in three study cases: two of them in simulation to test the variation of each parameter and one in the field to test the influence on battery management and height influence. All cases were tested in the three possible situations: same incidence rate, different rates, and different rates with no bird damage to fruit crops. The field tests were also essential to understand the algorithm's behavior of the path planning algorithm in the UAV, showing that there is less efficiency with fewer points of interest, but this does not correlate with the flight time. In addition, there is no association between the maximum horizontal speed and the flight time, which means that the function to calculate the total distance for path planning needs to be adjusted. Thus, the proposed algorithm presents promising results with an outstanding reduced average error in the total distance for the path planning obtained and low execution time, being suited for this and other applications.", "Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Manipulators (UAMs) have shown promising potential in mobile 3-dimensional grasping applications, but they still suffer from some difficulties impeding their board applications, such as target detection and indoor positioning. For the autonomous grasping mission, the UAMs need ability to recognize the objects and grasp them. Considering the efficiency and precision, we present a novel oriented-object detection method called Rotation-SqueezeDet. This method can run on embedded-platforms in near real-time. Besides, this method can give the oriented bounding box of an object in images to enable a rotation-aware grasping. Based on this method, a UAM platform was designed and built. We have given the formulation, positioning, control, and planning of the whole UAM system. All the mechanical designs are fully provided as open-source hardware for reuse by the community. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme was validated in multiple experimental trials, highlighting its applicability of autonomous aerial rotational grasping in Global Positioning System (GPS) denied environments. We believe this system can be deployed to many potential workplaces which need UAM to accomplish difficult manipulation tasks.", "Application of Python programming language in automation of measurement systems and creating virtual instruments is discussed in this paper.

Smart home energy management system (SHEMS) are one example of such a technology. It connects homes to a smart grid and may increase the use of renewable energy by directing the demand to off-peak hours and reducing the overall energy demand. User values of such a technology may be critical in the acquisition, adoption and assimilation of the technology. This research fills the gap of understanding user values of SHEMS users. We studied new, potential and experienced users of SHEMS and their values. Sensory ethnography interview method was applied in the value sensitive design empirical investigation to elicit key user values of SHEMS in 28 families. The users relate to SHEMS values such as economic gains, environmental sustainability, comfort and security. Some SHEMS users' values such as stimulation, creativity, and autonomy, can be in conflict with the values of other family members, and with those which are currently built in the SHEMS technologies. The recognized values of SHEMS stakeholders act as an input for the design of smart grid and smart home services and products. In addition, the research contributes to the theory-building of smart home technology user research.", "Maintenance of water resources through collection of water followed by laboratory analysis, is a key factor in the measurement of water quality. The main difficulty for water collection and analysis is the logistics of the process, since the collections are often made by mall boats in very distant aquifers, applying manual processes, and are sometimes based on few samples. In this paper, the development, construction, and implementation of a robotic airboat to measure water quality in lakes has been described. The airboat was developed in the form of a mini-boat, in a fiberglass structure, whose interior housed a battery, a Raspberry Pi mini-computer, a Wi-Fi router for connection to a notebook, tablet or cell phone, and sensors connected to the Arduino platform. The airboat was validated in two lagoons in Fortaleza, and in a reservoir in the city of Pacatuba. The results were collected with the purpose of analyzing the parameters of each lagoon. The main contribution of this work was the development of an autonomous system of acquiring water parameters from several points of the lagoon.", "In the present work, a modular and low-cost FPGA-based phased array system was developed that uses transducers emitting at 40 kHz for the acoustic levitation of small objects (<= 4 mm). The system consists of a driver board, transducer arrays with various layouts, and software developed in MATLAB (R). The software can be used to simulate the acoustic field, calculate acoustic traps, and control the driver board via a provided USB-SPI interface. The driver board controls up to 100 channels simultaneously with square-wave signals up to 20 Vpp with pi/1024 phase resolution and 10 bit amplitude resolution. Several phased arrays can be linked via a provided (IC)-C-2 interface to increase the number of available channels. The functionality of the system is demonstrated by the levitation of small objects using a flat 40 kHz transducer array.", "Many urban areas face an increasing flood risk, which includes the risk of flash floods. Increasing extreme precipitation events will likely lead to greater human and economic losses unless reliable and efficient early warning systems (EWS) along with other adaptation actions are put in place in urban areas. The challenge is in the integration and analysis in time and space of the environmental, meteorological, and territorial data from multiple sources needed to build up EWS able to provide efficient contribution to increase the resilience of vulnerable and exposed urban communities to flooding. Efficient EWS contribute to the preparedness phase of the disaster cycle but could also be relevant in the planning of the emergency phase. The RainBO Life project addressed this matter, focusing on the improvement of knowledge, methods, and tools for the monitoring and forecast of extreme precipitation events and the assessment of the associated flood risk for small and medium watercourses in urban areas. To put this into practice, RainBO developed a webGIS platform, which contributes to the \"planning\" of the management of river flood events through the use of detailed data and flood risk/vulnerability maps, and the \"event management\" with real-time monitoring/forecast of the events through the collection of observed data from real sensors, estimated/forecasted data from hydrologic models as well as qualitative data collected through a crowdsourcing app.", "Project 'RAMESIS', solved by SURO+UTEF+NUVIA, is aimed at the improvement of population safety through supporting Citizen Monitoring in Czechia.

State of the art flight management controllers provide extensive interfaces for control and navigation, but most commonly aim for performing in outdoor navigation scenarios. Indoor navigation with MAVs is challenging, because of spatial constraints and lack of drift-free positioning systems like GPS. Instead, vision and/or inertial-based methods are used to localize the MAV against the environment. For educational purposes and moreover to test and develop such algorithms, since 2015 the so called droneSpace was established at the Institute of Computer Graphics and Vision at Graz University of Technology. It consists of a flight arena which is equipped with a highly accurate motion tracking system and further holds an extensive robotics framework for semi-autonomous MAV navigation. A core component of the droneSpace is a Scalable and Lightweight Indoornavigation MAV design, which we call the SLIM (A detailed description of the SLIM and related projects can be found at our website: https:// sites.google.com/view/w-a-isop/home/education/slim). It allows flexible vision-sensor setups and moreover provides interfaces to inject accurate pose measurements form external tracking sources to achieve stable indoor hover-flights.

We present use cases from research projects but also courses at the Graz University of Technology, whereas we discuss results and potential future work on the platform.", "The Radio Access Network (RAN) is envisaged to undergo a significant transformation in the context of 5G and beyond mobile communications systems. One of the driving forces behind this transformation is the applicability of Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Taking as a reference the high-level architecture for a next generation RAN proposed by the Open RAN Alliance, this paper identifies the applicability domains where ML techniques can play a relevant role. For each domain, namely radio physical layer processing, Medium Access Control (MAC) scheduling, near-real time Radio Resource Management (RRM), RAN data analytics and RAN operational automation, the paper discusses the specific functionalities that can benefit from the application of ML and analyses the key considerations and challenges that need to be addressed when developing ML-based solutions, given the particular characteristics of the mobile radio environment.", "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are being used to facilitate monitoring of patients in hospital and home environments. These systems consist of a variety of different components/sensors and many processes like clustering, routing, security, and self-organization. Routing is necessary for medical-based WSNs because it allows remote data delivery and it facilitates network scalability in large hospitals. However, routing entails several problems, mainly due to the open nature of wireless networks, and these need to be addressed. This paper looks at two of the problems that arise due to wireless routing between the nodes and access points of a medical WSN (for IoT use): black hole and selective forwarding (SF) attacks. A solution to the former can readily be provided through the use of cryptographic hashes, while the latter makes use of a neighbourhood watch and threshold-based analysis to detect and correct SF attacks. The scheme proposed here is capable of detecting a selective forwarding attack with over 96% accuracy and successfully identifying the malicious node with 83% accuracy.", "Remote monitoring and intelligent intervention of machines are essentials in a smart industrial environment. However, the heterogeneity of machines makes it difficult to construct solutions for this purpose. This work aims to describe how to provide smart industrial environments using Smart Gateways, RESTful Web Services, and Cloud Computing. In the proposed solution, a Smart Gateway is responsible for representing a given machines' resources as RESTful Web Services for clients and Web applications, sending monitored data to a persistence service in a Cloud, while also allowing for the remote control of these machines. As a proof of concept, a smart industrial environment was developed from the considerations of a real case study at an apparel factory. Functional testing and performance evaluation confirmed the feasibility of the solution in this case study.", "Biometric systems are important for access control and authentication in various application scenarios. Single biometrics can be selected for authentication, but a multimodal approach is typically more reliable. In this paper, a multimodal biometric authentication system is developed. It consists of wireless sensor nodes equipped with accelerometers and infrared cameras, which enable analysis of gait and vein scanning for authentication. Observed error equal rates for the gait and vein authentication are 13% and 11% respectively, whilst the equal error rate for the combined metrics is 8%.", "The objective of this work is to develop a framework that can deploy and provide coordination between multiple heterogeneous agents when a swarm robotic system adopts a decentralized approach; each robot evaluates its relative rank among the other robots in terms of travel distance and cost to the goal. Accordingly, robots are allocated to the sub-tasks for which they have the highest rank (utility). This paper provides an analysis of existing swarm control environments and proposes a software environment that facilitates a rapid deployment of multiple robotic agents. The framework (UBSwarm) exploits our utility-based task allocation algorithm. UBSwarm configures these robots and assigns the group of robots a particular task from a set of available tasks. Two major tasks have been introduced that show the performance of a robotic group. This robotic group is composed of heterogeneous agents. In the results, a premature example that has prior knowledge about the experiment shows whether or not the robots are able to accomplish the task.", "In the actual era of smart homes and smart grids, advanced technological systems that allow the automation of domestic tasks are developing rapidly. There are numerous technologies and applications that can be installed in smart homes today. They enable communication between home appliances and users, and enhance home appliances' automation, monitoring and remote control capabilities. This review article, by introducing the concept of the smart home and the advent of the smart grid, investigates technologies for smart homes. The technical descriptions of the systems are presented and point out advantages and disadvantages of each technology and product today available on the market. Barriers, challenges, benefits and future trends regarding the technologies and the role of users have also been discussed.", "Developing self-organised swarm systems capable of adapting to environmental changes as well as to dynamic situations is a complex challenge. An efficient labour division model, with the ability to regulate the distribution of work among swarm robots, is an important element of this kind of system. This paper extends the popular response threshold model and proposes a new adaptive response threshold model (ARTM). Experiments were carried out in simulation and in real-robot scenarios with the aim of studying the performance of this new adaptive model. Results presented in this paper verify that the extended approach improves on the adaptability of previous systems. For example, by reducing collision duration among robots in foraging missions, our approach helps small swarms of robots to adapt more efficiently to changing environments, thus increasing their self-sustainability (survival rate). Finally, we propose a minimal version of ARTM, which is derived from the conclusions drawn through real-robot and simulation results.", "This paper describes the work that was carried out in designing a public addressing system based on Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). The system uses a V51053 codec to perform all the required encoding and decoding, and an STM32W108CC as a controller, with the capability of performing wireless communication. Satisfactory results were obtained from the public address system. The playback had an average Mean Opinion Score (MOS) of 4.0. The average data transfer rate was maintained over a distance of 20 m.", "This paper presents a visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system consisting of a robust visual odometry and an efficient back-end with loop-closure detection and pose-graph optimization (PGO). Robustness of the visual odometry is achieved by utilizing dual cameras pointing different directions with no overlap in their respective fields of view mounted on an micro aerial vehicle (MAV). The theory behind this dual-camera visual odometry can be easily extended to applications with multiple cameras. The back-end of the SLAM system maintains a keyframe-based global map, which is used for loop-closure detection. An adaptivewindow PGO method is proposed to refine keyframe poses of the global map and thus correct pose drift that is inherent in the visual odometry. The position of each map point is then refined implicitly due to its relative representation to its source keyframe. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed visual SLAM algorithm for applications onboard MAVs in experiments with both autonomous and manual flights. The pose tracking results are compared with the ground truth data provided by an external tracking system.", "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of epilepsy-related mortality, but its genetic etiology is largely unknown and likely complex involving multiple genes. The Kcna1 gene encodes Kv1.1 potassium channels that act to dampen neuronal excitability whereas the Scn2a gene encodes Nav1.2 sodium channels important for action potential conduction. We tested the hypothesis that subclinical Scn2a heterozygosity reduces SUDEP incidence in Kcna1-null mice of SUDEP, by suppressing neurocardiac dysfunction associated with the absence of Kv1.1 channels. SUDEP-prone Kcna1-null mice exhibited about a 50% increase in lifespan when heterozygous for the Scn2a-null allele, that is Scn2a(+/-), Kcna1(-/-). In simultaneous video electroencephalography (EEG)-electrocardiography (ECG) recordings, Scn2a heterozygosity did not eliminate seizures in Kcna1(-/-)mice, but seizure burden was partially reduced due to a significant reduction in seizure durations. Analysis of beat-to-beat heart rate variability (HRV) revealed that Kcna1(-/-) and Scn2a(+/-), Kcna1(-/-) mice exhibit similarly high RMSSD (Root Mean Square of the Successive Differences), suggesting the functional interactions between the two mutations do not involve significant alteration of parasympathetic tone. Moreover, analysis of EEG-ECG interaction dynamics revealed a significantly higher degree of association between brain and cardiac activity in double mutant mice compared to Kcna1(-/-)animals for several different measures, suggesting that Scn2a-null heterozygosity reduces SUDEP risk by altering neural control of the heart. These findings expand our understanding of the complex genetic interactions underlying SUDEP and identify EEG-ECG association as a potential new biomarker of SUDEP susceptibility.", "Workspaces augmented by multitouch and gesture-sensing systems are quickly becoming a reality, but studies appear to limit themselves to interacting with displays. With the continued progress of the ubiquitous computing movement, everyday objects are coming to life and will soon enter these augmented spaces. Little has been studied regarding gestural control of everyday objects capable of movement in three-dimensional space. In the present study, we augment an office lamp for gestural interaction and use it toward finding more natural gestures for augmented workspace interaction with physical objects. We begin by surveying the current literature on user-defined gesture sets and digital augmentation of lamps to determine features desirable in the design of an actuated desk lamp. A prototypical Tabletop Assistive Droid (TAD) is then used in a study conducted to determine and analyze a feasible user-defined gesture set.", "In this paper, we present a distributed control strategy, enabling agents to converge onto and travel along a consensually selected curve among a class of closed planar curves. Individual agents identify the number of neighbors within a finite circular sensing range and obtain information from their neighbors through local communication. The information is then processed to update the control parameters and force the swarm to converge onto and circulate along the aforementioned planar curve. The proposed mathematical framework is based on stochastic differential equations driven by white Gaussian noise (diffusion processes). Using this framework, there is maximum probability that the swarm dynamics will be driven toward the consensual closed planar curve. In the simplest configuration where a circular consensual curve is obtained, we are able to derive an analytical expression that relates the radius of the circular formation to the agent's interaction range. Such an intimate relation is also illustrated numerically for more general curves. The agent-based control strategy is then translated into a distributed Braitenberg-inspired one. The proposed robotic control strategy is then validated by numerical simulations and by implementation on an actual robotic swarm. It can be used in applications that involve large numbers of locally interacting agents, such as traffic control, deployment of communication networks in hostile environments, or environmental monitoring.", null, "This half day course introduces the field of musical interface design and implementation. Participants will learn and practice key aspects of the theory and practice of designing original interactive music technology with case studies including augmented and sensor based instruments, audio-visual instruments, mobile, and networked music making. Digital technologies offer powerful opportunities for the creation and manipulation of sound, however the flexibility of these technologies implies a confusing array of choices for musical composers and performers. Some artists have faced this challenge by using computers directly to create new musical forms. However, most would agree the computer is not a musical instrument, in the same sense as traditional instruments, and it is natural to ask 'how to play the computer' in a way appropriate to human brains and bodies. To attempt to answer this question in the course, we draw from the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) [1,2], which began as a workshop of CHI 2001 [3] and explore connections with the established field of human-computer interaction.", "The rapid growth of wireless data networks has introduced unprecedented traffic that far exceeds the deployment of cellular infrastructures. Caching has been a common approach for coping with the increased amount of traffic. In this paper we propose an in-network cache assisted eNodeB caching mechanism for 4G LTE Networks. The idea is to cache content objects at eNodeBs(1) and leverage in-network caches to improve eNodeB caching. We model the cost structure from both bandwidth and delay viewpoints and show that eNoodeB caching is noticeably beneficial. We propose a framework in which eNodeBs can use the information from in-network caches to improve caching performance. We formulate the problem of maximizing delay reduction and prove that the problem is NP-complete. We provide a 2-competitive offline algorithm and a practical online algorithm to solve the problem. We conduct trace-driven simulations and experiment under both synthetic and real network topologies. Results show that our approach can significantly save bandwidth for mobile operators and reduce delays for end users. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The main objective of this study was to develop the method of automatic recognition of sedentary behavior related to cardiovascular risk based on quantitative measurement of physical activity. The solution is based on the designed prototype of the smart shirt equipped with a processor, wearable sensors, power supply and telemedical interface. The data derived from wearable sensors were used to create feature vector that consisted of the estimation of the user-specific relative intensity and the variance of filtered accelerometer data. The method was validated using an experimental protocol which was designed to be safe for the elderly and was based on clinically validated short physical performance battery (SPPB) test tasks. To obtain the recognition model six classifiers were examined and compared including Linear Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Binary Decision Trees and Artificial Neural Networks. The classification models were able to identify the sedentary behavior with an accuracy of 95.00% +/- 2.11%. Experimental results suggested that high accuracy can be obtained by estimating sedentary behavior pattern using the smart shirt and machine learning approach. The main advantage of the developed method to continuously monitor patient activities in a free-living environment and could potentially be used for early detection of increased cardiovascular risk.", "Adeno-associated virus (AAV) consists of a simple genome, infects mammalian cells, displays nonpathogenicity in humans, and spans an array of serotypes and variants bearing distinct tissue tropisms. These attributes lend AAV tremendous promise as a gene delivery vector, further substantiated by its extensive testing in human clinical trials. Rational design approaches to capsid engineering leverage current scientific knowledge of AAV to further modulate, enhance and optimize the performance of the vectors. Capsid modification strategies include amino acid point mutations, peptide domain insertions, and chemical biology approaches. Through such efforts, insights regarding AAV capsid sequence-structure-function relationships can be learned. Developments over the last 5 years in rational design-based capsid engineering approaches will be presented and discussed.", "The article describes an innovative mechatronic device for hand rehabilitation, which enables diagnostics, comprehensive exercises and reporting the rehabilitation results of individual fingers of people who have lost their full efficiency as a result of past illnesses (i.a. stroke) and orthopedic injuries. The basic purpose of the device is to provide controlled, active exercises of the individual fingers, to widen the range of their movements, and to increase their precision of movement. The developed mechatronic device works with original software for PCs containing a diagnostic module, reporting module and a set of virtual reality exercises using biofeedback. The device uses auditory and visual biofeedback, and electromyography (EMG).", "Open innovation practices are widespread in the industry. The software sector, marked by the rise of open source, is a striking example. This paper presents the preliminary results of an exploratory research on estimating the value of open intangible assets. Our approach favors simplicity and relies on a partial automation of the evaluation. An evaluation structure, distinguishing the different forms of value involved in open intangible assets, particularly applicable to software, is provided as an illustration of the proposed approach.", "This paper presents the design and implementation of a compact in size, modular battery powered conventional EEG (cEEG) signal acquisition board based on ADS1298. An introduced novel vertically stackable board design allows solve EEG front-end scaling problem and to effectively reconfigure hardware even for most demanding applications. The system allows to capture 16 to 64 EEG channels at sample rates from 250 Hz to 1000 Hz and to transfer raw EEG signal over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi interface. Furthermore, simple but effective validation techniques are provided for such system evaluation. Conducted tests confirm the validity of the system for real world applications and against official datasheet specifications. With a 6.59 microvolts peak-to-peak input referred noise and -97 dB common mode rejection ratio in 0-70 Hz band the proposed design can be a low-cost precision cEEG research device.", "Although air pollution is one of the most significant environmental factors posing a threat to human health worldwide, air quality data are scarce or not easily accessible in most European countries. The current work aims to develop a centralized air quality data hub that enables citizens to contribute to air quality monitoring. In this work, data from official air quality monitoring stations are combined with air pollution estimates from sky-depicting photos and from low-cost sensing devices that citizens build on their own so that citizens receive improved information about the quality of the air they breathe. Additionally, a data fusion algorithm merges air quality information from various sources to provide information in areas where no air quality measurements exist.", "Testbeds are powerful large-scale experimentation tools. Often, however, their limited scope and/ or unrealistic functionality result in anecdotal use. Knowledge transfer becomes more effective through pilots, but they involve techno-economic challenges with uncertain outcomes. Platform-based design has proven a valuable strategy to overcome similar barriers. However, we identify that while this platformization is happening in the cloud elements of the value chain, Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices are still designed in an application-specific manner, thus limiting pilots initiatives.", "The use of RGB-D cameras has become an affordable solution for robot mapping and navigation in contrast to expensive 2D laser range finders. Although these sensors provide richer information about the 3D environment, most successful mapping and navigation techniques for mobile robots have been developed considering a 2D planar environment. In this paper, we present our system for 2D navigation using RGB-D sensors. The key feature of our system is the extraction of 2D laser scans out of the 3D point cloud provided by the camera that can be later used by common mapping or localization approaches. Along with the real experiments we raise the question \"how far can we go with the use of RGB-D sensors for 2D navigation?\" and we analyze performance and limitations of the system compared to accurate, yet expensive, laser-based systems.", "The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) produces a real-time realization of UTC(NIST) which is used to contribute to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and as a source for accurate time in the USA. The atomic clocks contributing to the time scale ensemble, the time transfer systems used to contribute to UTC and the distribution system used to disseminate UTC(NIST) to remote users are located in different parts of the NIST campus, far from each other and from the UTC(NIST) reference point. Since the physical inputs to these systems are not collocated within the campus, an accurate and stable infrastructure for time signal distribution is required. Currently, the local delays need to be known with an uncertainty of a few hundreds of picoseconds to avoid compromising the ultimate accuracy of the time transfer link's calibrations. Previously, coaxial cables or a commercial fiber-based frequency transfer system implemented by amplitude-modulation of a laser source were used to distribute signals between on-site locations, and clock trip calibrations were performed to measure the delays experienced by these signals [1]. The capability of WR-based time transfer systems to provide an on-time, accurate remote copy of its input pulse-per-second (PPS) signal made it a very appealing alternative to our previously implemented distribution system, which required time consuming re-calibration following instances of temporary signal interruptions. In this paper, we evaluate the use of WR-based time and frequency transfer within the NIST campus and verify its calibration procedure using a clock trip protocol [1].", "Active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) with suboptimal pharmacokinetic properties may require formulation into nanoparticles. In addition to the quality of the excipients, production parameters are crucial for producing nanoparticles which reliably deliver APIs to their target. Microfluidic platforms promise increased control over the formulation process due to the decreased degrees of freedom at the micro- and nanoscale. Publications about these platforms usually provide only limited information about the soft- and hardware required to integrate the microfluidic chip seamlessly into an experimental set-up. We describe a modular, low-budget prototype for microfluidic mixing in detail. The prototype consists of four modules. The control module is a raspberry pi executing customizable python scripts to control the syringe pumps and the fraction collector. The feeding module consists of up to three commercially available, programable syringe pumps. The formulation module can be any macro- or microfluidic chip connectable to syringe pumps. The collection module is a custom-built fraction collector. We describe each feature of the working prototype and demonstrate its power with polyplexes formulated from siRNA and two different oligomers that are fed to the chip at two different stages during the assembly of the nanoparticles.", "With the increasing popularity of the Internet of Things (IoT), the issue of its information security has drawn more and more attention. To overcome the resource constraint barrier for secure and reliable data transmission on the widely used IoT devices such as wireless sensor network (WSN) nodes, many researcher studies consider hardware acceleration of traditional cryptographic algorithms as one of the effective methods. Meanwhile, as one of the current research topics in the reduced instruction set computer (RISC), RISC-V provides a solid foundation for implementing domain-specific architecture (DSA). To this end, we propose an extended instruction scheme for the advanced encryption standard (AES) based on RISC-V custom instructions and present a coprocessor designed on the open-source core Hummingbird E203. The AES coprocessor uses direct memory access channels to achieve parallel data access and processing, which provides flexibility in memory space allocation and improves the efficiency of cryptographic components. Applications with embedded AES custom instructions running on an experimental prototype of the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) platform demonstrated a 25.3% to 37.9% improvement in running time over previous similar works when processing no less than 80 bytes of data. In addition, the application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) experiments show that in most cases, the coprocessor only consumes up to 20% more power than the necessary AES operations.", "Nowadays, the usage of electronic devices running artificial neural networks (ANNs)-based applications is spreading in our everyday life. Due to their outstanding computational capabilities, ANNs have become appealing solutions for safety-critical systems as well. Frequently, they are considered intrinsically robust and fault tolerant for being brain-inspired and redundant computing models. However, when ANNs are deployed on resource-constrained hardware devices, single physical faults may compromise the activity of multiple neurons. Therefore, it is crucial to assess the reliability of the entire neural computing system, including both the software and the hardware components. This article systematically addresses reliability concerns for ANNs running on multiprocessor system-on-a-chips (MPSoCs). It presents a methodology to assign resilience scores to individual neurons and, based on that, schedule the workload of an ANN on the target MPSoC so that critical neurons are neatly distributed among the available processing elements. This reliability-oriented methodology exploits an integer linear programming solver to find the optimal solution. Experimental results are given for three different convolutional neural networks trained on MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10. We carried out a comprehensive assessment on an open-source artificial intelligence-based RISC-V MPSoC. The results show the reliability improvements of the proposed methodology against the traditional scheduling.", "One of the general problems in modern digital society is undoubtedly the information security topic. It is critical to ensure the security of information transferred, processed, and stored throughout digital channels. Among this information, digital images draw attention in terms of frequency of use in digital channels. In this study, a new image encryption algorithm is proposed to address the security problems of digital images. The aspect that differentiates the proposed algorithm from thousands of image encryption algorithms in the literature is that it is designed within the framework of the provable security design principle. The provable security design approach has ensured that the proposed algorithm is theoretically secure with mathematical proof techniques. In addition to addressing the proposed architecture security concerns, the hybrid random number generator used as the key generator constitutes another unique aspect. This generator, which was designed using chaotic systems, physical unclonable functions, and optimization algorithms, stands out as the innovative aspect of the study. The statistical randomness properties of the proposed random number generator were tested using the NIST SP 800-22 Statistical Test Suite. Successful results were obtained for 15 tests in the test package. In addition, the success of these outputs was tested on a new image encryption algorithm. The security of the proposed algorithm was tested from different angles using various experimental analyzes and a 12-step provable security analysis roadmap. Successful analysis results and performance measurements indicate that the proposed cryptographic components can be used in many information security applications and many future designs.", ["Objectives", "The aim of this study was to identify physical design elements that contribute to potential falls in patient rooms. Methods", "An exploratory, physical simulation-based approach was adopted for the study. Twenty-seven subjects, older than 70 years (11 male and 16 female subjects), conducted scripted tasks in a mockup of a patient bathroom and clinician zone. Activities were captured using motion-capture technology and video recording. After biomechanical data processing, video clips associated with potential fall moments were extracted and then examined and coded by a group of registered nurses and health care designers. Exploratory analyses of the coded data were conducted followed by a series of multivariate analyses using regression models. Results", "In multivariate models with all personal, environmental, and postural variables, only the postural variables demonstrated statistical significance-turning, grabbing, pushing, and pulling in the bathroom and pushing and pulling in the clinician zone. The physical elements/attributes associated with the offending postures include bathroom configuration, intravenous pole, door, toilet seat height, flush, grab bars, over-bed table, and patient chair. Conclusions", "Postural changes, during interactions with the physical environment, constitute the source of most fall events. Physical design must include simultaneous examination of postural changes in day-to-day activities in patient rooms and bathrooms. Among discussed testable recommendations in the article, the followings design strategies should be considered: (a) designing bathrooms to reduce turning as much as possible and (b) designing to avoid motions that involve 2 or more of the offending postures, such as turning and grabbing or grabbing and pulling, and so on."], "Low-cost sensor technology has been available for several years and has the potential to complement official monitoring networks. The current generation of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) sensors suffers from various technical problems. This study explores the added value of calibration models based on (multiple) linear regression including cross terms on the performance of an electrochemical NO2 sensor, the B43F manufactured by Alphasense. Sensor data were collected in duplicate at four reference sites in the Netherlands over a period of one year. It is shown that a calibration, using O-3 and temperature in addition to a reference NO2 measurement, improves the prediction in terms of R-2 from less than 0.5 to 0.69-0.84. The uncertainty of the calibrated sensors meets the Data Quality Objective for indicative methods specified by the EU directive in some cases and it was verified that the sensor signal itself remains an important predictor in the multilinear regressions. In practice, these sensors are likely to be calibrated over a period (much) shorter than one year. This study shows the dependence of the quality of the calibrated signal on the choice of these short (monthly) calibration and validation periods. This information will be valuable for determining short-period calibration strategies.", "This essay explores the potential for transitioning from platform capitalism to a commons-oriented postcapitalist ethical economy. Platform capitalism is an \"updated\" version of capitalism advanced by online software platforms. Trebor Scholz juxtaposes platform cooperativism with platform capitalism, aiming to outdo the latter by means of communal ownership, democratic governance, and the equitable distribution of value. Bauwens and Kostakis criticize platform cooperativism as insufficient insofar as it operates under a closed copyright system. They argue instead for incorporating platform cooperativism into a broader model of open cooperativism, premised on the principles of commons-based peer production. The essay concludes with a critical appraisal of Bauwens and Kostakis's model of open cooperativism.", "We present the OpenFlexure Microscope software stack which provides computer control of our open source motorised microscope. Our diverse community of users needs both graphical and script-based interfaces. We split the control code into client and server applications interfaced via a web API conforming to the W3C Web of Things standard. A graphical interface is viewed either in a web browser or in our cross-platform Electron application, and gives basic interactive control including common operations such as Z stack acquisition and tiled scanning. Automated control is possible from Python and Matlab, or any language that supports HTTP requests. Network control makes the software stack more robust, allows multiple microscopes to be controlled by one computer, and facilitates sharing of equipment. Graphical and script-based clients can run simultaneously, making it easier to monitor ongoing experiments. We have included an extension mechanism to add functionality, for example controlling additional hardware components or adding automation routines. Using a Web of Things approach has resulted in a user-friendly and extremely versatile software control solution for the OpenFlexure Microscope, and we believe this approach could be generalized in the future to make automated experiments involving several instruments much easier to implement.", "The evolution of energy-efficient ultra-low-power (ULP) parallel processors and the diffusion of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are fueling the advent of autonomous driving nano-sized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These sub-10cm robotic platforms are envisioned as next-generation ubiquitous smart-sensors and unobtrusive robotic-helpers. However, the limited computational/memory resources available aboard nano-UAVs introduce the challenge of minimizing and optimizing vision-based CNNs - which to date require error-prone, labor-intensive iterative development flows. This work explores methodologies and software tools to streamline and automate all the deployment of vision-based CNN navigation on a ULP multicore system-on-chip acting as a mission computer on a Crazyflie 2.1 nano-UAV. We focus on the deployment of PULP-Dronet (Palossi et al., 2019), a state-of-the-art CNN for autonomous navigation of nano-UAVs, from the initial training to the final closed-loop evaluation. Compared to the original hand-crafted CNN, our results show a 2x reduction of memory footprint and a speedup of 1.6x in inference time while guaranteeing the same prediction accuracy and significantly improving the behavior in the field, achieving: i) obstacle avoidance with a peak braking-speed of 1.65 m/s and improving the speed/braking-space ratio of the baseline, free flight in a familiar environment up to 1.96 m/s (0.5 m/s for the baseline), and iii) lane following on a path featuring a 90deg turn - all while using for computation less than 1.6% of the drone's power budget. To foster new applications and future research, we open-source all the software design in a ready-to-run project compatible with the Crazyflie 2.1.", "The industrial internet of things (IIoT) is an intelligent network of industrial components that can communicate with each other to enhance the performance of manufacturing and industrial processes. For the many advantages, such as less no contracts, free to develop and high inter-operability, in this work we propose using open-source technologies to develop IIoT platforms for information integration and data analysis. To realize the development and deployment of open source IIoTs, we present our framework OPIIoT (Open Communication Protocol Platform for Industrial Internet of Things) with the system construction cycle to solve various integration problems of operational technology and information technology. Moreover, we describe the underlying design principles and the implementation details of the proposed framework are given to make it more understandable and applicable to the IIoT platform developers. To verify the proposed framework, we have conducted both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. We have compared the important features of our OPIIoT and several commercial platforms for industry, performed trials on data communication and analytics for information supports, and demonstrated the web interface for system implementation. The results prove the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed framework.", "Swarm Robotics (SR) is an extension of the study of Multi-Robot Systems that exploits concepts of communication, coordination and collaboration among a large number of robots. The massive parallelization yielded by the robots working together can make a task faster than in the case of the usage of a single complex robot. One of the main aspects in robotic swarms is that the control is decentralized by definition and distributed among the robots of the swarm, improving the system robustness and fault-tolerance. Furthermore, this characteristic often allows the emergence of collective behaviors from the robot's interaction with each other and with the environment through their embodied sensors and actuators. In most cases, the number of inputs from sensor readings turns analytical solutions hard or even impossible. Thus, many ad-hoc approaches are contributed to deal with the situation at hand. The main goal of this review is to find out, through the study of existing research works of the field, the reason behind the lack of exploitation of swarm robotic systems in real-world applications. For this purpose, we first review the different possibilities of study in SR: physical and simulated robotic platforms, development methodologies and the variety of basic tasks and collective behaviors. We then briefly describe some fields related do SR that have a big impact on the development of SR. After that, based on existing taxonomies found in literature, we categorize existing research works regarding SR in two large main groups: those that deal with SR design and those that deal with tasks as required in SR. The review of both existing robots and techniques in the literature show a diversity of approaches to discuss SR issues. Nonetheless, it is easily noticeable from these works that there is a clamant absence of solid real-world applications of SR. An analysis of the interests and bottlenecks of this field indicates that the number of research works is smaller than those in other related areas. This suggests that, even though with many research studies, the field of SR is not yet mature enough, mainly due the absence of a universal methodology and generic robots that can be used in any, or at least in many, applications. Thus, we emphasize, discuss and analyze the urgent need for standardization of many aspects in SR, including hardware and software, as to allow a possible flourishing of SR applicability to real-world applications. This standardization could accelerate a great deal the field of SR, thus facilitating the development of SR solutions for applications that impact our daily life.", "Swarm robotics in maritime engineering is a promising approach characterized by large numbers of relatively small and inexpensive autonomous aquatic crafts (AACs) to monitor marine environments. Compared with a single, large aquatic manned or unmanned surface vehicle, a highly distributed aquatic swarm system with several AACs features advantages in numerous real-world maritime missions, and its natural potential is qualified for new classes of tasks that uniformly feature low cost and high efficiency through time. This article develops an inexpensive AAC based on an embedded-system companion computer and open-source autopilot, providing a verification platform for education and research on swarm algorithm on water surfaces. A topology communication network, including an inner communication network to exchange information among AACs and an external communication network for monitoring the state of the AAC Swarm System (AACSS), was designed based on the topology built into the Xbee units for the AACSS. In the emergence control network, the transmitter and receiver were coupled to distribute or recover the AAC. The swarm motion behaviors in AAC were resolved into the capabilities of go-to-waypoint and path following, which can be accomplished by two uncoupled controllers: speed controller and heading controller. The good performance of velocity and heading controllers in go-to-waypoint was proven in a series of simulations. Path following was achieved by tracking a set of ordered waypoints in the go-to-waypoint. Finally, a sea trial conducted at the China National Deep Sea Center successfully demonstrated the motion capability of the AAC. The sea trial results showed that the AAC is suited to carry out environmental monitoring tasks by efficiently covering the desired path, allowing for redundancy in the data collection process and tolerating the individual AACs' path-following offset caused by winds and waves.", "Even on modern SSDs, I/O scheduling is a first-order performance concern. However, it is unclear how best to optimize I/O patterns for SSDs, because a complex layer of proprietary firmware hides many principal aspects of performance, as well as SSD lifetime. Losing this information leads to research papers drawing incorrect conclusions about prototype systems, as well as real-world systems realizing sub-optimal performance and lifetime. It is our position that a useful performance model of a foundational system component is essential, and the community should support efforts to construct models of SSD performance. We show examples from the literature and our own measurements that illustrate serious limitations of current SSD modeling tools and disk statistics. We observe an opportunity to resolve this problem by reverse engineering SSDs, leveraging recent trends toward component standardization within SSDs. This paper presents a feasibility study and initial results to reverse engineer a commercial SSD's firmware, and discusses limitations and open problems.", "The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices for patient monitoring has gained much attention in clinical care performance, proficient chronic disease management, and home caregiving. This work presents the design of efficient medical IoT sensor nodes (SNs) in terms of low-cost, low power-consumption, and increased data accuracy based on open-source platforms. The method utilizes a Sensor Controller (SC) within the IoT SN, which is capable of performing medical checks supporting a broad coverage of medical uses. A communication protocol has been developed for data and command exchange among SC, local gateways, and physicians' or patients' mobile devices (tablets, smart phones). The SC supports moving average window (MAW) and principle component analysis (PCA) filtering algorithms to capture data from the attached low-cost body sensors of different sampling profiles. Significant extensions in SN's portability is achieved through energy consumption minimization based on the idle time gaps between sensors' activations. SN's components are either deactivated or set to low activity operation during these idle intervals. A medical case study is presented and the evaluated results show that the proposed SN can be incorporated into e-health platforms since it achieves comparable accuracy to its certified and high-cost commercial counterparts.", "Root system architecture is critical for plant growth, which is influenced by several edaphic, environmental, genetic, and biotic factors including beneficial and pathogenic microbes. Studying root system architecture and the dynamic changes that occur during a plant's lifespan, especially for perennial crops growing over multiple growing seasons, is still a challenge because of the nature of their growing environment. We describe the utility of an imaging platform called RhizoVision Crown to study root system architecture of alfalfa, a perennial forage crop threatened by Phymatotrichopsis root rot (PRR) disease. Phymatotrichopsis omnivore is the causal agent of PRR disease that reduces alfalfa stand longevity. During the lifetime of the stand, PRR disease rings enlarge and the field can be categorized into three zones based upon plant status: asymptomatic, disease front and survivor. To study root system architectural changes associated with PRR, a 4-year-old 25.6-ha alfalfa stand infested with PRR was selected at the Red River Farm, Burneyville, OK during October 2017. Line transect sampling was conducted from four actively growing PRR disease rings. At each disease ring, six line transacts were positioned spanning 15 m on either side of the disease front with one alfalfa root crown sampled at every 3 m interval. Each alfalfa root crown was imaged with the RhizoVision Crown platform using a backlight and a high-resolution monochrome CMOS camera enabling preservation of the natural root system integrity. The platform's image analysis software, RhizoVision Analyzer, automatically segmented images, skeletonized, and extracted a suite of features. Data indicated that the survivor plants compensated for damage or loss to the taproot through the development of more lateral and crown roots, and that a suite of multivariate features could be used to automatically classify roots as from survivor or asymptomatic zones. Root growth is a dynamic process adapting to ever changing interactions among various phytobiome components. By utilizing the low-cost, efficient, and high-throughput RhizoVision Crown platform, we quantified these changes in a mature perennial forage crop.", "The exploration of smart systems and their capability to record health data is growing rapidly today. Health data can be sent directly to medical professionals, and alerts can be sent to users at their convenience on mobile devices or other applications. The utilization of Wi-Fi sensors in smart systems can be a major shift in how data is collected and distributed as well as in the way patients utilize this to be independent and aware of their health. Non-invasive technology has many benefits that range from no scars or wounds, reduction of pain, and a faster recovery time for patients. In this paper, we reviewed non-invasive technologies, the type of health status they can identify, and barriers of adopting smart health solutions.", "This paper advances the previous work done by Janiak et al., by implementing a generic optimal tracking control law for tracking the motion of a 2-DOF helicopter. While most of the 2-DOF helicopter control algorithms proposed in the literature to date are tested using computer simulations, the focus of the current work is to practically implement a leading optimal tracking control scheme for converging a 2-DOF helicopter to its desired configuration asymptotically. The contribution of the current manuscript is to generalize the implementation framework for various control strategies that can be deployed for controlling the motion of a set of 2-DOF helicopters. The optimal tracking control scheme considered in this work takes into account the measurements of pitch and yaw angles, and their angular speeds to generate actuator commands for main and tail propellers of a 2-DOF helicopter. The performance of the optimal tracking controller is demonstrated using a set experiments conducted in a laboratory setting.", "In this article, we present a novel high-performance millirobot (milli-robot-Toronto), designed to allow for the testing of complex swarm-behaviours, including human-swarm interaction. milli-robot-Toronto, built only with off-the-shelf components, has locomotion, processing and sensing capabilities that significantly improve upon existing designs, while maintaining one of the smallest footprints among current millirobots. As complementary software to this hardware development, herein, we also present a new global swarm-topology estimation algorithm. The method is novel in that it uniquely fuses incomplete location data collected by the individual robots in a distributed manner to optimally estimate the topology of the overall swarm using a centralized computer. It is a generalized technique usable by any swarm comprising robots capable of collecting location estimates of neighbouring robots. Numerous experiments, evaluating the performance of milli-robot-Toronto and the proposed optimal swarm-topology estimation algorithm, are also included.", "Research data management (RDM) is increasingly important in scholarship. Many researchers are, however, unaware of the benefits of good RDM and unsure about the practical steps they can take to improve their RDM practices. Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) addresses this cultural barrier by appointing Data Stewards at every faculty. By providing expert advice and increasing awareness, the Data Stewardship project focuses on incremental improvements in current data and software management and sharing practices. This cultural change is accelerated by the Data Champions who share best practices in data management with their peers. The Data Stewards and Data Champions build a community that allows a discipline-specific approach to RDM. Nevertheless, cultural change also requires appropriate rewards and incentives. While local initiatives are important, and we discuss several examples in this paper, systemic changes to the academic rewards system are needed. This will require collaborative efforts of a broad coalition of stakeholders and we will mention several such initiatives. This article demonstrates that community building is essential in changing the code and data management culture at TU Delft.", "The optogenetic revolution enabled spatially-precise and temporally-precise control over protein function, signaling pathway activation, and animal behavior with tremendous success in the dissection of signaling networks and neural circuits.

The target application of the stimulator is to induce retinal degeneration in fly photoreceptor cells by exposing them to light in a controlled manner. The goal of this work is to obtain a reproducible system for studying age-related changes in susceptibility to environmental ocular stress. The stimulator uses light emitting diodes and an embedded computer to control illuminance, color (blue or red) and duration in two independent chambers. Further, the stimulator is equipped with per-chamber light and temperature sensors and a fan to monitor light intensity and to control temperature. An ON/OFF temperature control implemented on the embedded computer keeps the temperature from reaching levels that will induce the heat shock stress response in the flies. A custom enclosure was fabricated to house the electronic components of the stimulator. The enclosure provides a light-impermeable environment that allows air flow and lets users easily load and unload fly vials. Characterization results show that the fabricated stimulator can produce light at illuminances ranging from 0 to 16000 lux and power density levels from 0 to 7.2 mW/cm(2) for blue light. For red light the maximum illuminance is 8000 lux which corresponds to a power density of 3.54 mW/cm(2). The fans and the ON/OFF temperature control are able to keep the temperature inside the chambers below 28.17 degrees C. Experiments with white-eye male flies were performed to assess the ability of the fabricated simulator to induce blue light-dependent retinal degeneration. Retinal degeneration is observed in flies exposed to 8 h of blue light at 7949 lux. Flies in a control experiment with no light exposure show no retinal degeneration. Flies exposed to red light for the similar duration and light intensity (8 h and 7994 lux) do not show retinal degeneration either. Hence, the fabricated stimulator can be used to create environmental ocular stress using blue light. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Beekeepers are used to take care of their bee colonies observing them and learning to interpret their behavior. Despite the rearing of bees represents one of the most antique human habits, nowadays bees risk the extinction principally because of the increasing pollution levels related to human activity. It is important to increase our knowledge about bees in order to develop new practices intended to improve their protection. These practices could include new technologies, in order to increase profitability of beekeepers and economical interest related to bee rearing, but also innovative rearing techniques, genetic selections, environmental politics and so on. Moreover bees, since they are very sensitive to pollution, are considered environmental indicators, and the research on bees could give important information about the conditions of soil, air and water.", "In this paper we propose a real hardware and software solution for apply the internet-of-things concept to bees in order to help beekeepers to improve their business and collect data for research purposes."], "This paper proposes a dynamic image-based visual servoing (IBVS) control law for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a single fixed on-board camera facing downward.

However, a number of challenges exist: ultra-high-bit-rate requirements from the transport of increased bandwidth radio streams for multiple antennas in future mobile networks, and low latency and jitter to meet delay requirements and the demands of joint processing. A new fronthaul functional division is proposed which can alleviate the most demanding bit-rate requirements by transport of baseband signals instead of sampled radio waveforms, and enable statistical multiplexing gains. Delay and synchronisation issues remain to be solved. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

If equipped with optical sensors, orthophotos with very high spatial resolution can be retrieved using photogrammetric processing.

The mean duration of EEG1 was 53 +/- 12.3 min and that of EEG2 was 29.6 +/- 12.8 min. The mean quality scores of EEG1 and EEG2 were 6.4 [range, 1 (low) to 10 (high); both medians 7.0]. A total of 44 (29.5%) participants had epileptiform discharges (EDs) at EEG1 and 25 (16.8%) had EDs at EEG2.

The present work evolved from a Field Programmable Gate Array- (FPGA) based design to simulate urban growth into a generic architecture that is automatically generated by a framework to efficiently compute complex cellular automata with large 29 x 29 neighborhoods in Cartesian or toroidal grids, with 16 or 256 states per cell. The new architecture and the framework are presented in detail, including results in terms of modeling capabilities and performance. Large neighborhoods greatly enhance CA modeling capabilities, such as the implementation of anisotropic rules. Performance-wise, the proposed architecture runs on a medium-size FPGA up to 51 times faster vs. a CPU running highly optimized C code. Compared to GPUs the speedup is harder to quantify, because CA results have been reported on GPU implementations with neighborhoods up to 11 x 11, in which case FPGA performance is roughly on par with GPU; however, based on published GPU trends, for 29 x 29 neighborhoods the proposed architecture is expected to have better performance vs. a GPU, at one-10th the energy requirements.

The Exascale level of performance having 1018 calculations per second is another remarkable achievement in computing with a fathomless influence on everyday life. The current technologies are facing various challenges while achieving ExaFlop performance through energy-efficient systems. Massive parallelism and power consumption are vital challenges for achieving ExaFlop performance. In this paper, we have introduced a novel parallel programming model that provides massive performance under power consumption limitations by parallelizing data on the heterogeneous system to provide coarse grain and fine-grain parallelism. The proposed dual-hierarchical architecture is a hybrid of MVAPICH2 and CUDA, called the M2C model, for heterogeneous systems that utilize both CPU and GPU devices for providing massive parallelism.

That is, they protect Trusted Applications (TAs) even if the Operating System or the hypervisor are compromised. The TEE runs in parallel with the OS and leverages a set of hardware and software components to create such an isolated environment. However, this isolation can be broken by exploiting microarchitectural side-channels. The state of the shared components of multi-core processors depends on the actual processes being executed, and as a result, some information is leaked from one process to any other running in the same processor. This leakage completely breaks the confidentiality guarantees that TEEs promise. The only way to completely avoid the leakage is to avoid the share of resources, but this is nearly impossible to achieve without a huge degradation in the performance of the processor. Assuming that it is possible that the leakage exists, and the attacker only can get information from the observable microarchitectural state, we propose to monitor the hardware resources to detect the microarchitectural state changes caused by the attacks. To this end, we have implemented a hardware module that compares at runtime pre-stored microarchitectural execution signatures of each enclave, with the actual execution trace, and triggers an alarm when it detects significant variation.", "The increased use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), better known as drones, by civilians has grown exponentially and their autonomous flight control systems have improved significantly, which has resulted in a greater number of accidents and dangerous situations.

In SSDGOF, the fusion model of GPS and optical flow raw data is compared with the model of fusion data in the normal state of the drone, and the difference between them is used to determine whether the sensor was attacked. The SSDGOF is evaluated through GPS deception experiments, and the results show that this method is superior to other methods in detection efficiency.", "Nowadays Manhole Cover (MC) failure is on the rise and generally affects the safety, security and economy of the society.

Because of the measurement restriction and measurement efficiency issues of applying conventional channel sounders in HSR scenarios, railway-network-based channel measurements are becoming quite attractive. In this paper, a method that employs the cell-specific reference signal in long-term-evolution (LTE) railway networks as the excitation signal to perform HSR channel measurements is presented. This method is implemented by a novel channel measurement system composed of existing LTE railway networks and a dedicated LTE receiver, which can efficiently collect the time-frequency-space channel data and is able to measure different communication links simultaneously. Based on this system, field measurements that consider both direct coverage and relay coverage schemes are conducted on the Beijing-to-Tianjin HSR in China.

A key challenge for these open initiatives is to attract participants and realize their subsequent community progression, termination and re-joining. Yet, membership dynamics are not well understood nor concepts put in relationship. We pursue to provide an overview of different participation phases and antecedents of progression of members. Our analysis of present research identifies four key participation phases, representing member 'landing' points, and two core concepts explaining contribution and latent activities on how, and why participants advance. Based on these findings and led by the theory of social learning we develop a participation model describing a consistent framework for community joining, contributing and leaving. This model is able to combine latest research and identify influences affecting progression. We highlight socialization and alliance building among volunteers, and provide insights into causes for membership dynamics. Moreover, we propose a yet lacking pre-participation phase highlighting community selection before joiners interact with the community. Our model solves the puzzle of an end-to-end membership perspective, and helps guiding researchers and community managers in understanding member management and participation behavior.", "The dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT) facilitates high-affinity presynaptic DA reuptake that temporally and spatially constrains DA neurotransmission. Aberrant DAT function is implicated in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder. DAT is a major psychostimulant target, and psychostimulant reward strictly requires binding to DAT. DAT function is acutely modulated by dynamic membrane trafficking at the presynaptic terminal and a PKC-sensitive negative endocytic mechanism, or \"endocytic brake,\" controls DAT plasma membrane stability. However, the molecular basis for the DAT endocytic brake is unknown, and it is unknown whether this braking mechanism is unique to DAT or common to monoamine transporters. Here, we report that the cdc42-activated, nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, Ack1, is a DAT endocytic brake that stabilizes DAT at the plasma membrane and is released in response to PKC activation. Pharmacologic and shRNA-mediated Ack1 silencing enhanced basal DAT internalization and blocked PKC-stimulated DAT internalization, but had no effects on SERT endocytosis. Both cdc42 activation and PKC stimulation converge on Ack1 to control Ack1 activity and DAT endocytic capacity, and Ack1 inactivation is required for stimulated DAT internalization downstream of PKC activation. Moreover, constitutive Ack1 activation is sufficient to rescue the gain-of-function endocytic phenotype exhibited by the ADHD DAT coding variant, R615C. These findings reveal a unique endocytic control switch that is highly specific for DAT. Moreover, the ability to rescue the DAT(R615C) coding variant suggests that manipulating DAT trafficking mechanisms may be a potential therapeutic approach to correct DAT coding variants that exhibit trafficking dysregulation.", "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of epilepsy-related mortality, but its genetic etiology is largely unknown and likely complex involving multiple genes. The Kcna1 gene encodes Kv1.1 potassium channels that act to dampen neuronal excitability whereas the Scn2a gene encodes Nav1.2 sodium channels important for action potential conduction. We tested the hypothesis that subclinical Scn2a heterozygosity reduces SUDEP incidence in Kcna1-null mice of SUDEP, by suppressing neurocardiac dysfunction associated with the absence of Kv1.1 channels. SUDEP-prone Kcna1-null mice exhibited about a 50% increase in lifespan when heterozygous for the Scn2a-null allele, that is Scn2a(+/-), Kcna1(-/-). In simultaneous video electroencephalography (EEG)-electrocardiography (ECG) recordings, Scn2a heterozygosity did not eliminate seizures in Kcna1(-/-)mice, but seizure burden was partially reduced due to a significant reduction in seizure durations. Analysis of beat-to-beat heart rate variability (HRV) revealed that Kcna1(-/-) and Scn2a(+/-), Kcna1(-/-) mice exhibit similarly high RMSSD (Root Mean Square of the Successive Differences), suggesting the functional interactions between the two mutations do not involve significant alteration of parasympathetic tone. Moreover, analysis of EEG-ECG interaction dynamics revealed a significantly higher degree of association between brain and cardiac activity in double mutant mice compared to Kcna1(-/-)animals for several different measures, suggesting that Scn2a-null heterozygosity reduces SUDEP risk by altering neural control of the heart. These findings expand our understanding of the complex genetic interactions underlying SUDEP and identify EEG-ECG association as a potential new biomarker of SUDEP susceptibility.", "Natural gas distribution systems play a fundamental role in delivering a primary energy resource toward industrial, tertiary and residential building. These networks assume today an increasing relevance due to growing energy demand and tighter environmental constrains, but they are still operated and managed according to aging practices, without any \"smartness\" given by information and communication technologies. In this paper, a prototypal monitoring and controlling systems has been implemented on the natural gas medium pressure grid feeding the city of Bari (Italy). Results prove that such an application can considerably upgrade the overall reliability and efficiency of the gas distribution process, also assuring the possibility of very fast interventions in case of leakage or breaking of pipes with predictable benefits in terms of personal safety and economic savings.", "Dense optical flow is a crucial visual cue for obstacle avoidance and motion control for robotic systems functioning in complex unstructured environments. In order to compute image motion for modern highly dynamic robots, it is necessary to use high speed vision systems. To perceive small and thin objects such as tree branches, fence poles, and other similar objects, high resolution vision systems must be used. The data stream from a high-resolution, high-speed vision system will saturate the onboard data bus and overload the onboard processor of almost all existing robotic systems. To implement such a vision system, we believe it is necessary to process the data in situ at the camera using dedicated processing hardware, a vision processing paradigm that we term rapid embedded vision (REV) systems. Even then, the task of processing multiple hundred hertz of dense high-resolution images is not possible using classical algorithms and classical computing hardware. A new processing paradigm that actively exploits the high frame rate of the image sequences, and high performance computing hardware such as GPU or FPGA must be employed. This letter proposes a filtering algorithm for the computation of dense optical flow fields in real time. The filter is designed as a pyramidal structure of update and propagation loops, where an optical flow state is constantly refined with new image data from the camera. The computational properties of the proposed algorithm makes it well suited for implementation in GPU and FPGA systems. We present results from a GPU implementation achieving frame rates in the order of 800 Hz at VGA resolution. Experimental validation and comparison is provided for both synthetic and real life high speed video sequences at frame rates of 300 Hz and 1016 x 544 pixel resolution.", "Maintenance of the water quality in swimming pools is a challenge for home owners with limited budgets. Existing pool automation systems are expensive and entry-level models can only control pH and chlorine levels. This paper presents a web-based swimming pool information system that is capable of taking various sensor measurements and interface with actuators to automate numerous elements of pool maintenance. Apart from measuring pH and chlorine levels, the system is also able to maintain a set water level and can activate/deactivate the pool pump remotely according to a user-defined schedule. The system can be remotely monitored and configured via WiFi.", null, "An emerging topic in the development field is how information and communication technology (ICT) can be used for economic and social development. The general approach relies on technological determinism, whereby the discussion revolves around how and to what extent will ICT support development. It assumes the benefits of ICT as inherent. This approach ignores that ICT is created and experienced within a socially divisive and complex space. A more critical and sociological analysis is needed for development studies to better understand the implications of ICT initiatives. In this article, I argue that Saskia Sassen's analytical framework of technology and society as embedded avoids this technological determinism and allows social theorists to account for social and material aspects of ICT. To support this alternative framework, I present a case study of a rural ICT initiative in Gujarat, India, and discuss how this re-conceptualization reveals more nuanced understanding of ICT and society. Based on interviews and field research, I find that technology creates new social understandings for the rural ICT users, but also that society shapes the technology to make it inaccessible for them.", "This work presents the City Dynamics and Smart Environment activities of the Smart Ring project, a model for the smart city, based on the integration of sustainable urban transport services and environmental monitoring over a 4-5-km circular path, the Smart Ring, around the historical center of l'Aquila (Italy). We describe our pilot experience performed during an experimental on-demand public service electric bus, SmartBus, which was equipped with a multi-parametric air quality low-cost gas electrochemical sensor platform, NASUS IV. For five days (28-29 August 2014 and 1-3 September 2014), the sensor platform was installed inside the SmartBus and measured air quality gas compounds (nitrogen dioxide, carbon oxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide) during the service. Data were collected and analyzed on the bases of an air quality index, which provided qualitative insights on the air status potentially experienced by the users. The results obtained are in agreement with the synoptic meteorological conditions, the urban background air quality reference measurements and the potential traffic flow variations. Furthermore, they indicated that the air quality status was influenced by the gas component NO and CO. We discuss the features of our campaign, and we highlight the potential, limitations and key factors to consider for future project designs.", "One of the main challenges for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAVs) is to extend the endurance of small vehicles such as multi-rotors. Actually, Li-po batteries that guarantee a flight of about 20 min power this type of vehicles. The endurance can be extended by enabling vehicles to look for recharging station(s). In this paper, we propose a vision system able to detect and track a given pattern hosted on the target-landing platform. The pattern is also useful to estimate the UAV position while approaching the target or during the hovering close to the target. The paper focuses on an optimized adaptive thresholding technique that manages critical situations as changes in the scene's illumination / shadows. The developed system runs at 90 Hz for processing a 752x480 grayscale image. Preliminary results on an NVidia Tegra Jetson K1 platform are also presented to distribute the computation between CPU and GPU.", "In this paper, we propose a visual servoing control for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) which is based on a state transformation technique. The UAV is equipped with a single downwards facing camera, and the motion control objective is the regulation of relative displacement and yaw to a stationary visual target located on the ground. The state transformation is defined by a system of partial differential equations (PDEs) which eliminate roll and pitch rate dependence in the transformed image feature kinematics. A method for computing the general solutions of these PDEs is given, and we show a particular solution reduces to an established virtual camera approach. We treat point and line cases and introduce image moment features defined in the virtual camera image plane. Robustness of the control design is improved by accounting for attitude measurement bias, and uncertainty in thrust gain, mass, and image feature depth. The asymptotic stability of the closed-loop is proven. The method is based on a simple proportional-integral-derivative (PID) structure which can be readily implemented on-board. Experimental results show improved performance relative to previous work.", "For the CBM experiment a Timing and Fast-Control (TFC) system is being developed. In the detector readout, FPGA-based data processing boards (DPB) are organized in a large number of computing crates. At the crate level, the TFC master is connected to one TFC slave per crate, whereas the DPB AMCs are interconnected by the crates' infrastructure. In this article, an FMC-based signal distribution board is proposed allowing the transmission of a high-quality clock and timing and fast-control data from and to connected TFC slaves at distances of about 30 meters using twisted-pair cables.", "The Internet of Things (IoT) is gradually becoming a reality, supported by an assortment of heterogeneous devices, varying from resource-starved wireless sensors to embedded devices and resource-rich backend systems, which are supplemented by a range of networking technologies and protocols. Nevertheless, this diverse ecosystem of platforms and protocols, along with the inherent limitations in processing power, energy, memory and communications bandwidth for some of the involved devices, render secure and interoperable interactions a primary concern, and an important obstacle to the introduction of novel applications, and the adoption of IoT in general. Motivated by the above, this work presents SeMIBIoT, a Secure Multi-protocol Integration Bridge for the IoT. Acting as a gateway, SeMIBIoT is able to provide hop-by-hop or end-to-end secure communications between an array of heterogeneous nodes and standardized IoT protocols, guaranteeing seamless interactions and thus alleviating security and interoperability concerns. Using a realistic testbed featuring a number of diverse platforms, the bridge is evaluated in a variety of scenarios, validating the feasibility of the proposed approach.", "In the Cultural Heritage domain, novel fruition and enjoyment approaches, based on Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, have the effect to change the way people expenencing cultural spaces, such as museums and exhibitions. Within these environments, a mam challenge is to classify and forecast the behaviours of visitors by collecting their movements, choices and needs. In this paper, starting from the design of an IoT system for collecting behavioural data, we propose and discuss a model able to reproduce, and then \"predict\", the dynamics related to the interactions of the visitors with the exposed artworks and, in particular, with the available technologies. Generally, collected data are affected by many kinds of errors; to address this issue a powerful statistical method to reproduce the dynamics related to the visiting styles of the spectators is proposed. Numencal experiments on real data have been reported in order to assess the proposed methodology.", "An optical transport network is composed of optical transport systems deployed in thousands of office-buildings. As a common infrastructure to accommodate diversified communication services with drastic traffic growth, it is necessary not only to continuously convey the growing traffic but also to achieve high end-to-end communication quality and availability and provide flexible controllability in cooperation with service layer networks. To achieve high-speed and large-capacity transport systems cost-effectively, system configuration, applied devices, and the manufacturing process have recently begun to change, and the cause of failure or performance degradation has become more complex and diversified. The drastic traffic growth and pattern change of service networks increase the frequency and scale of transport-capacity increase and transport-network reconfiguration in cooperation with service networks. Therefore, drastic traffic growth affects both optical-transport-system configuration and its operational cycles. In this paper, we give an overview of the operational problems emerging in current nationwide optical transport networks, and based on trends analysis for system configuration and network-control schemes, we propose a vision of the future nationwide optical-transport-network architecture expressed using five target features.", "Recent years demonstrate an increased interest in low-cost Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) in citizen science for ecological monitoring and environmental protection. However, most efforts have targeted land use, leaving ocean and nautical applications greatly unexplored. In this paper we present the design, deployment and testing of POSEIDON, a low-cost PAM system for nautical citizen science and real-time acoustic augmentation of whale-watching experiences. POSEIDON uses machine learning techniques to identify vocal acoustic samples of common cetaceans like whales and dolphins. When discriminating the calls, we find that Extra Trees and Gradient Boosting outperform other classifiers (>0.95 confidence threshold). The features extracted from the machine learning models are used to enhance the whale watching experience and provide citizen science data to marine biologists and environmental protection agencies. While this paper focuses on the design of the system, future work will focus on user testing and widespread deployment of open-hardware and software for nautical PAM applications.", ["The ability to tolerate, remediate, and recover from network incidents (caused by device failures and fiber cuts, for example) is critical for building and operating highly-available web services. Achieving fault tolerance and failure preparedness requires system architects, software developers, and site operators to have a deep understanding of network reliability at scale, along with its implications on the software systems that run in data centers. Unfortunately, little has been reported on the reliability characteristics of large scale data center network infrastructure, let alone its impact on the availability of services powered by software running on that network infrastructure.", "This paper fills the gap by presenting a large scale, longitudinal study of data center network reliability based on operational data collected from the production network infrastructure at Facebook, one of the largest web service providers in the world. Our study covers reliability characteristics of both intra and inter data center networks. For intra data center networks, we study seven years of operation data comprising thousands of network incidents across two different data center network designs, a cluster network design and a state-of-the-art fabric network design. For inter data center networks, we study eighteen months of recent repair tickets from the field to understand reliability of Wide Area Network (WAN) backbones. In contrast to prior work, we study the effects of network reliability on software systems, and how these reliability characteristics evolve over time. We discuss the implications of network reliability on the design, implementation, and operation of large scale data center systems and how it affects highly-available web services. We hope our study forms a foundation for understanding the reliability of large scale network infrastructure, and inspires new reliability solutions to network incidents."], "Sip-and-Puff controlled wheelchairs enable individuals with severe disabilities to gain some mobility and autonomy. However, Sip-and-Puff controlled wheelchairs are cumbersome to use, causing fatigue and discomfort after prolonged use. To remedy this issue, an autonomous wheelchair with a Sip-and-Puff interface is proposed. An improved design, that requires the Sip-and-Puff device to select a destination, is presented in this paper. Once the destination is selected, further input is not required since the autonomous navigation system performs the navigation to the destination. Ten trials were conducted to test the autonomous navigation capabilities of the new wheelchair. The wheelchair successfully navigated the path of 10.26 meters in 100% of the trials with no collisions. The average time to navigate to the destinations was 28.6 seconds. Ten trials were conducted to test the Sip-and-Puff device as well as the efficacy of the user interface. The average time to select a destinations using the Sip-and-Puff device was 6.3 seconds. The average time for the user to cancel navigation and select a new destination was 4.86 seconds. These results show promise of greatly improving usability compared to conventional Sip-and-Puff controlled wheelchairs. The destination selection time and rerouting times are shorter due to the simple design of user interface and the overall navigation times are shorter due to the autonomous navigation system.", "Internet of Things (IoT) devices play a crucial role in the overall development of IoT in providing countless applications in various areas. Due to the increasing interest and rapid technological growth of sensor technology, which have certainly revolutionized the way we live today, a need to provide a detailed analysis of the embedded platforms and boards is consequential. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the recent and most-widely used commercial and research embedded systems and boards in different classification emphasizing their key attributes including processing and memory capabilities, security features, connectivity and communication interfaces, size, cost and appearance, operating system support, power specifications, and battery life and listing some interesting projects for each device.

Since biosensing devices are nowadays very common in developed countries, particularly in the field of diagnostics, they are at a stage of maturity at which other potential outcomes can be explored, especially on their possibilities for multiplexing and automation to reduce the time-to-results. However, the translation is far from being trivial. In order to understand the factors and barriers that can facilitate or hinder the application of biosensors in resource-limited settings, we analyze the context from several angles. First, the technology of the devices themselves has to be rethought to take into account the specific needs and the available means of these countries. For this, we describe the partition of a biosensor into its functional shells, which define the information flow from the analyte to the end-user, and by following this partition we assess the strengths and weaknesses of biosensing devices in view of their specific technological development and challenging deployment in low-resource environments. Then, we discuss the problem of cost reduction by pointing out transversal factors, such as throughput and cost of mistreatment, that need to be re-considered when analyzing the cost-effectiveness of biosensing devices. Beyond the technical landscape, the compliance with regulations is also a major aspect that is described with its link to the validation of the devices and to the acceptance from the local medical personnel. Finally, to learn from a successful case, we analyze a breakthrough inexpensive biosensor that is showing high potential with respect to many of the described aspects. We conclude by mentioning both some transversal benefits of deploying biosensors in developing countries, and the key factors that can drive such applications.", "The Internet of Things (IoT) has become an important agenda in the advanced manufacturing environment. In order to encourage IoT application and assure an appropriate selection of processes to be improved by IoT technology, a group of analysis criteria must be highlighted to give the companies a tool to perform the correct selection. This study aims to propose a model for selecting IoT technology. The research design combines a systematic literature review, applying bibliometrics and content analysis, with case application and refinement. An application was carried out in an IoT hardware company, incorporating it at a solvent recycling machine. A second application was performed in a seedling selection machine producer. As a result, a model for selecting IoT technology is presented, which consists of four phasesprocess modeling, grading, weighting, and final selection. The model applies an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) based on the following criteria: reliability, security, business, mobility, and heterogeneity. The results also suggest IoT selection is related to the ability of combining different criteria related to the system and technology selection to install IoT solutions. Finally, issues related to the system characteristics other than technology are becoming more cited in the literature in the last 5years concluding that selecting IoT technology is a complex activity that needs to be improved, especially in the years to come.", "We propose Automatic-SSD that converts all storage management logic into hardware, which enable energy efficient, high performance fast memory based block storage. To achieve low operating power, Automatic-SSD directly reads or writes host-side data to underlying backend storage media without internal DRAM caches. To realize such DRAM-less approach with better performance and make it more energy efficient, Automatic-SSD also removes the internal processor(s) and firmware execution therein by fully automating the backend request management and data trausfers over all pipelined hardware modules. We prototype Automatic-SSD on a middle-end FPGA custom board, employing massive numbers of phase change memories as representative of new memory technologies. Our evaluation results show that, compared to a conventional firmware-based approach, Automatic-SSD shows up 28.8x and 25.4x better bandwidth and latency behaviors, respectively, while consuming only 5% of the total energy, on overage.", "The specialized bioamplifier for active electrode applications is presented in this paper. Our device presents 4 channeled bioamplifier with option to connect 3 couples of active electrodes and one couple of standard electrodes. The measured signal processing and digitalization are based on the ADS1194 chip by Texas Instruments. The graphical user interface is also presented in this article. The end of the article is focused on the measurement of electrocardiogram and electromyogram to prove the ability of the prototype to measure bioelectrical signals. The article also shows the simple design of active electrode for capacitive coupled sensing with integrated ultra-low input bias current operational amplifier LMP7721 in configuration as voltage buffer.", "The beer production chain includes some crucial steps regarding processing, delivery, service, and consumption that can benefit from the implementation of IoT (Internet of Things) based technologies. Large breweries implemented the use of sensors and digitization before smaller ones among which are craft breweries. Internet of Beer (IoB) technologies are becoming accessible to mid and small sized brewing companies. Therefore, the objective of this work is to review mainly low-cost IoB smart technologies that can be implemented from the mash to the final product and its service, to improve the brewing production, control, delivery, and final quality increasing profitability. The reviewed applications were retrieved both from the scientific databases and from the web. The work is structured in three macro areas such as beer processing, product logistics and traceability, and service. The results show a future trend characterized by a very fast increase in the use of IoB (also open source) systems to drive efficiency, productivity, quality, and safety. This will be done by real-time monitoring and a data-driven decision support system (DSS). Crucial aspects needing further investigation are data ownership and data standardization. The access price of IoB devices and software is destined for a significant decrease while their diversification on the market will grow leading to a massive future implementation within all the production levels.", "Optical microscopes are an essential tool for both the detection of disease in clinics, and for scientific analysis. However, in much of the world access to high-performance microscopy is limited by both the upfront cost and maintenance cost of the equipment. Here we present an open-source, 3D-printed, and fully-automated laboratory microscope, with motorised sample positioning and focus control. The microscope is highly customisable, with a number of options readily available including trans- and epi- illumination, polarisation contrast imaging, and epi-florescence imaging. The OpenFlexure microscope has been designed to enable low-volume manufacturing and maintenance by local personnel, vastly increasing accessibility. We have produced over 100 microscopes in Tanzania and Kenya for educational, scientific, and clinical applications, demonstrating that local manufacturing can be a viable alternative to international supply chains that can often be costly, slow, and unreliable.

However, the installations typically employ a fixed flat-plate system, using pre-specified angles acquired by geographical positioning. Hence, the power generated by PV systems decreases significantly, according to the variation of solar irradiation in the progress of a day and the seasons in a year. In order to increase the solar power generation, this paper proposes the design and implementation of a low-cost automatic dual-axis solar tracker system. The tracking system is designed as a closed-loop control based active tracking system, employing Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) sensors as the inputs of the system. The tracking strategy utilizes a digital logic design of the sensors' participation implemented in a pseudo-azimuthal system to simply rotate around the primary (north-south) axis and the secondary (east-west) axis. In the experiment, the proposed tracking system and the fixed flat-plate system were evaluated for the comparative study. The experimental results show that the proposed tracking system increased the efficiency of electrical energy by averagely 44.89%, using the proposed system compared with the fixed flat-plate system. Finally, the cost analysis is provided for the proposed tracking system.", "\"Who owns the sky\" is not a new question but a persistent one. For more than three centuries it emerges as a social, legal, technological, and geopolitical problem. Indeed, the aerial is not something that is simply above our heads but an element that fluctuates in and out of the body. And while the air and the body are inseparable, the aerial has been turned directly against the body in various ways since the beginning of the 20(th) century. This paper explores the unsettled frontiers of the fly-zone, looking into the interrelated occupations, exploitations, and democratizations of the aerial. It sketches the emergence of the state/corporate no-fly zone (NFZ) through the emergence of small-scale civilian drones, which developed into a sophisticated industry that negotiates new forms of state power to technology corporations. This new configuration of aerial control and management complicates the established, state-imposed, regulatory NFZ and suggests the development of a new techno-cultural assemblage of spatial closures through the air. Against this backdrop, I discuss two case-studies of aerial resistance through the use of do-it-yourself (DIY) aerial-photography in Israel/Palestine. I show how DIY tactics and tools offer a distinctive kind of evocation and provocation that challenge the conceptual and material boundaries of the NFZ and direct the attention to the ruptured links between the aerial and the human body. Finally, I discuss how DIY aerial-photography is also a particular kind of testimony and a methodological mediation that allows questioning the very premise of knowledge production through technosocial, activist engagement.", "In the future, UAVs should be a part of the IoT ecosystems. Integration of sensors onboard allows to enrich information stored in the cloud and, at the same time, to improve the capacities of UAVs. Developing new sensors and the integration in UAV architecture could improve control functions. Design of future UAV systems requires from advanced tools to analyze the system components and their interaction in real operational conditions. In this work, authors present an approach to integrate and evaluate a LIDAR sensor and the capacity for improving navigation and obstacle avoidance functions in simulated situations using a real UAV platform. It uses available software for mission definition and execution in UAVs based on PixHawk flight controller and peripherals. The proposed solution (a general method that could be used to integrate other kind of sensors) shows physical integration of the main types of sensors in UAV domain both for navigation and collision avoidance, and at the same time the use of powerful simulation models developed with Gazebo. Some illustrative results show the performance of this navigation and obstacle avoidance function using the simulated sensors and the control of the real UAV in realistic conditions.", "The open source phenomenon has gained tremendous traction within praxis and theory.

This article introduces the system of revenue registry which should be applied in the Czech Republic, critically analyses fundamental provisions of the draft bill and summarizes advantages and disadvantages of the regulation and its strength, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. Article deals with a hypothesis that implementation of revenue registry will fulfil the goals of the proposed regulation i.e. new source of data for tax administration, restriction of grey economy, more efficient tax collection, especially of income tax and VAT and also elimination of market inequalities in the Czech economy.", "A wireless sensor node platform was created along with a base station that can be used to monitor various parameters in the industry. A literature survey was conducted on important parameters found in the industry. The various standards that are set out for these parameters were analysed. The developed wireless sensor node platform along with the base station shows that a wide variety of industrial parameters can be monitored at once from one central place. The simplistic deployment/instalment of the created wireless sensor node platform along with the centralisation of important industrial parameters should appeal to large industries and reduce the risk of accidental unfortunate events.", "Open architectures like the one recently unveiled by Facebook allow a detailed assessment of the energy efficiency of commercial data centers. This paper explores the fit of Zipf-like distributions typical of network traffic, to updates of user pages and the entity graph, for the new Facebook data center network architecture. We find that network resource consumption could be reduced by as much as 40-50% through several changes, either to the software, or to the data center design. Of these, employing a connected hub-and-spoke subgraph representation for each popular node, with each pod operating locally on its node of the subgraph, appears to hold the most energy savings potential. This work is part of a larger effort to more completely characterize the efficiency of data center computer- and network architectures beyond the normal reporting of facility power utilization efficiency (PUE), which is blind to energy proportionality and other aspects of the efficiency within the computer- and network architecture, or IT portion, of the data center.", "Are the dynamics that underlie commons-based peer production in materially deprived societies the same as those at work in affluent settings? This article contributes to the debate on open development and commons-based peer production by drawing on an in-depth case study of Map Kibera, a popular citizen engagement and citizen mapping project in Nairobi, Kenya. Combining insights from the literature on peer production and participatory development, this examination of the empirical ndings focuses on three dimensions of information co-creation: participant motivations, the relationship between product-oriented versus process-oriented views of participation, and the governance of localized global public goods in economically resource-poor settings. This article provides a basis for greater conceptual clarity regarding the dynamics of open development in poor communities and a reconsideration of the appropriateness of a value-driven framework of commons-based peer production in materially deprived settings.", "In this paper, the robust finite-time attitude tracking problem for quadrotor system is investigated under the influences of coupled and nonlinear dynamics, parametric and unmodeled uncertainties, external disturbances and time-varying input and feedback delays. The robust finite-time attitude tracking controller is designed with a novel nonsingular terminal sliding mode control strategy. Finite-time convergence is proven and explicitly given based on Lyapunov approaches. Simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller. Experimental results are given to confirm the attitude tracking performance of the control strategy.", "This paper presents a novel ultrawideband wireless spread spectrum millimeter-wave (mmWave) channel sounder that supports both a wideband sliding correlator mode and a real-time spread spectrum mode, also known as wideband correlation or direct correlation. Both channel sounder modes are capable of absolute propagation delay (time of flight) measurements with up to 1 GHz of radio frequency null-to-null bandwidth, and can measure multipath with a 2-ns time resolution. The sliding correlator configuration facilitates long-distance measurements with angular spread and delay spread for up to 185 dB of maximum measurable path loss. The real-time spread spectrum mode is shown to support short-range, small-scale temporal, and Doppler measurements (minimum snapshot sampling interval of 32.753 aes) with a substantial dynamic fading range of 40 dB for human blockage and dynamic urban scenarios. The channel sounder uses field programmable gate arrays, analog-to-digital converters, digital-to-analog converters, and low-phase-noise rubidium standard references for frequency/time synchronization and absolute time delay measurements. Using propagation theory, several methods are presented here to calibrate and verify the accuracy of the channel sounder, and an improved diffraction model for human blockage, based on the METIS model but now including directional antenna gains, is developed from measurements using the channel sounder. The mmWave channel sounder described here may be used for accurate spatial and temporal ray-tracing calibration, to identify individual multipath components, to measure antenna patterns, for constructing spatial profiles of mmWave channels, and for developing statistical channel impulse response models in time and space.", "There are many necessities that need to be improved in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) education. The robotics represents a promising educational tool. Nowadays, robotic education tools arise with the aim of promoting the innovation and the motivation of the students during the learning process. Robots are becoming more common in our daily life; thus, it is important to integrate robots at all levels of our society. The aim of this paper is to present the use of Scratch - a widely-used tool - in order to guide educational robotics as the first step in introducing students into robotics. The robotics requires several skills such as systems thinking, programming mindset, active learning, mathematics, science, judgement and decision making, good communication, technology design, complex problem solving and persistence. These skills can be easily developed using Scratch. The obtained outcomes from the educational robotic course demonstrate how children without previous experience in programming or robotics can start learning both through experiences in the classroom. The result of this work shows that it is better to make very easy challenges, to adapt the difficulty to each of the children. Furthermore, it is necessary to develop previous concepts. Moreover, it is necessary to work the design, instead of programming directly. Additionally, it is important to combine theory and practice with the aim of including fun tasks intertwined with the challenges that are posed to apply theory in problem solving.", null, "Project-Based Learning (PBL) is a teaching method used in many Computer Science courses. To implement it, it is necessary to choose good problems that will drive students' learning. These problems have to instigate students interest, encourage collaboration and help them to develop their knowledge of course-related topics. This paper presents a case study that sought to verify how the Lean Startup Idea Invalidation process applied with a Validation Board a business strategy assessment tool may assist in the choice of significant problems. Initial results indicate that this method helps students discard bad ideas, improve on the most interesting ones and choose products that are actually used by real users.", "Environmental data is collected at unprecedented scales and speeds, targeting diverse societal challenges, and through the inclusion of multiple stakeholders. Yet, an understanding of enabling technologies involved in the engagement of citizens appear largely outside of the realm of air pollution. Recently, different air pollution projects have been rolled out in Europe and abroad; a structured analysis, however, of the way citizens are involved in these type of projects does not yet exist. In contribution to the ongoing EU-Funded project hackAlR, this paper therefore explores this research gap on the topic of air pollution and citizen science through the following question: Which engagement mechanisms can be identified in existing air pollution citizen science projects? We combine multiple literature sources, employ a systematic case study analysis and conduct seven qualitative interviews with key experts to target citizen science projects related to air pollution. Several mechanisms emerged at the interface between air pollution, citizen participation and knowledge production. These include: (1) Scale, (2) User-involvement and co-creation, (3) Communication, and (4) User motivation and aspects of behaviour. Despite its growing reputation in digital innovation, a majority of the mapped projects do not explicitly engage in any co-creation process. Multiple project insights suggest the importance of non-academic stakeholders as agents for communication and engagement. Campaign-based gamification can prove successful in establishing urgency in local contexts. Common engagement barriers include issues in the data contribution, science communication, technical project limitations, scaling and the critical nature of distributed sensors. This preliminary research offers a fruitful approach in assessing and comparing initiatives, and can enrich our understanding of the contribution that air pollution technology can have in citizen science.", "The widespread use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) has enabled the possibility to open a research project to the contributions of non-professional actors (amateurs, students or sometimes even experts without a formal job-title) in the so called \"open/citizen science\". Previous studies have shown as also non-professional actors have the potential to provide a valuable contribution also to complex research projects if the environment in which they are engaged is carefully designed. Theoretical frameworks and operative guidelines for developing public engagement activities for citizen science are still evolving and are not exhaustively defined. While designing the public engagement activities for a robotics research project, HeritageBot (HB), we looked for empirical guidelines and theoretical framework that could support our work. The lack of a structured and comprehensive answer to our research needs has been the initial trigger for this article. This paper explores the process of developing collaborative initiatives involving external non-professional actors in a set of HB's scientific research tasks through a set of public engagement activities. First, we will explore the theoretical framework and the selected methodologies for designing citizen-science strategies. Second, we will describe, through empirical episodes, the action research approach that we followed to develop HB's public engagement strategy. Finally, we will introduce the progresses in defining an experimental methodology, instrumental to the validation of the defined strategy.", "In this article, the design and implementation of an innovative photovoltaic system prototype intelligent control lighting based on Arduino and ZigBee described. The lighting system is connected to a power generation system composed of isolated photovoltaic cells. The lighting control system is subject to a vehicle detection permitting variation of the light intensity when vehicles circulating on the highway. The variation of the light intensity and control of the lighting system is managed through an Arduino microcontroller which in turn transmits information wirelessly to other luminaires distributed along the highway. Thus, it is expected that the lighting system present a significant savings in energy consumption by making use of innovative technologies.", "The continuous growth of the Internet of Things in recent years has meant it is increasingly more present, as Internet of Things scenarios such as smart homes and smart cities become part of our everyday lives. The Internet of Things devices involved can be divided into two categories in most Internet of Things scenarios. The devices can constitute a black box with specific sensors which complicates their configuration, for example, wearable products. Other Internet of Things devices can be composed through configurable microcontrollers, enabling customizable environments to be designed. However, the necessary tools and knowledge for programming and configuring microcontrollers are not accessible to everyone. This article proposes a run-time deployment and management system through the Constrained Application Protocol that bridges the gap between end users and customizable environments. With our system, end users can incorporate new sensors or actuators in their installed microcontroller without having to access and program the microcontroller board. Rather, they can manage the resources of the Constrained Application Protocol servers through an accessible and transparent Web user interface.", "In this paper, we investigate the problem of deploying 3D nodes in a wireless sensor network. The aim is to choose the ideal 3D locations to add new nodes to an initial configuration of nodes, while optimizing a set of objectives. In this regard, our study proposes a new hybrid algorithm which stems from the ant foraging behavior and the genetics. It is based on a recent variant of the genetic algorithms (NSGA-III) and the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm. The obtained numerical results and the simulations compared with experiments prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "The Synth-A-Modeler compiler enables portable, rapid and modular prototyping of audio-haptic models for single degree-of-freedom (d.o.f.) haptic interaction. This paper introduces hybrid modeling in Synth-A-Modeler, which mixes traditionally disparate virtual modeling paradigms from the computer music literature: digital waveguide models, mass-interaction models, and modal synthesis models. Hybrid modeling enables more salient adjustment of model parameters. Using the open-source Synth-A-Modeler toolchain, the resulting models can be compiled for a wide variety of programming languages and haptic devices, and the models are made openly available to the research and music communities.", "Free software development and the technological practices of hackers have been broadly recognised as fundamental for the formation of political cultures that foster democracy in the digital mediascape. This article explores the role of free software in the practices of digital artists, animators and technicians who work in various roles for the contemporary digital visual media industries. Rather than discussing it as a model of organising work, the study conceives free software as a production tool and shows how it becomes a locus of politics about finding material security in flexible capitalism. This politics is ultimately contradictory in that it extends creative and craft autonomy of digital artists but does not mobilise a critical project. Instead, it nurtures further precarious labour. Empirically, the article draws on ethnographically collected material from the media practices of digital artists and programmers who engage with two popular free software production tools, Blender and Synfig.", "The growing popularity of wearable devices is leading to new ways to interact with the environment, with other smart devices, and with other people. Wearables equipped with an array of sensors are able to capture the owner's physiological and behavioural traits, thus are well suited for biometric authentication to control other devices or access digital services. However, wearable biometrics have substantial differences from traditional biometrics for computer systems, such as fingerprints, eye features, or voice. In this article, we discuss these differences and analyse how researchers are approaching the wearable biometrics field. We review and provide a categorization of wearable sensors useful for capturing biometric signals. We analyse the computational cost of the different signal processing techniques, an important practical factor in constrained devices such as wearables. Finally, we review and classify the most recent proposals in the field of wearable biometrics in terms of the structure of the biometric system proposed, their experimental setup, and their results. We also present a critique of experimental issues such as evaluation and feasibility aspects, and offer some final thoughts on research directions that need attention in future work.", "A soft condensed matter sensor (SCMS) designed to measure strains on the human body is presented. The hybrid material based on carbon black (CB) and a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) was bonded to a textile elastic band and used as a sensor on the human wrist to measure hand motion by detecting the movement of tendons in the wrist. Additionally it was able to track the blood pulse wave of a person, allowing for the determination of pulse wave peaks corresponding to the systole and diastole blood pressures in order to calculate the heart rate. Sensor characterization was done using mechanical cycle testing, and the band sensor achieved a gauge factor of 4-6.3 while displaying low signal relaxation when held at a strain levels. Near-linear signal performance was displayed when loading to successively higher strain levels up to 50% strain.", "Stress in the workplace is known to be detrimental to one's physiological and psychological health. This paper proposes a wearable stress monitoring system using a body sensor network (BSN). BSNs are made up of a number of wearable/implantable biosensors that work together to perform a common task. The system was accurately able to monitor the stress of an individual and display the results in an intelligible (and useful) way to the user.", "Open source communities rely on the espoused premise of complete openness and transparency of source code and development process. Yet, openness and transparency at times need to be balanced out with moments of less open and transparent work. Through our detailed study of Linux Kernel development, we build a theory that explains that transparency and openness are nuanced and changing qualities that certain developers manage as they use multiple digital technologies and create, in moments of needs, more opaque and closed digital spaces of work. We refer to these spaces as digital folds. Our paper contributes to the extant literature by providing a process theory of how transparency and openness are balanced with opacity and closure in open source communities according to the needs of the development work; by conceptualizing the nature of digital folds and their role in providing quiet spaces of work; and, by articulating how the process of digital folding and unfolding is made far more possible by select elite actors' navigating the line between the pragmatics of coding and the accepted ideology of openness and transparency.", "Ubiquitous cellular coverage is often taken for granted, yet numerous people live outside, or at the fringes, of commercial cellular coverage. Further, natural disasters and human rights violations cause the displacement of millions of people annually worldwide, with many of these people relocating to shelters and camps in areas at or just beyond the margins of existing cellular infrastructure. In this work we design PhoneHome, a system prototype that extends existing cellular coverage to areas with no or damaged cellular infrastructure, or infrastructure that is otherwise poorly performing. We explore the feasibility of PhoneHome and address current limitations and future directions for independently operated, user-extensible cellular infrastructure.", "Popular portraits of hacking have often relied on histories of hobbyist engineering culture rooted in tales of middle-class, college-educated, and often male technologists. Since 2012, members of a mother-operated hackerspace in the East Bay of San Francisco, California, have countered these narratives, revealing hackerspaces as sites with which to refigure masculine claims to innovation and progress. Drawing on critical craft studies and studies of therapeutic culture, this article examines the workings of Mothership HackerMoms and its series of workshops called Failure Club, a project motivated by a desire to support women's creative pursuits with the onset of motherhood. By integrating feminist legacies of craftwork with the centrality of failure exposing personal failures and failures to transform hacker cultures members not only energize new modes of hacking activity but also hack the very ontology of hacking.", "Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have evolved rapidly during the last decade, and many architecture types have been proposed for distributed and interconnected systems. However, most systems are implemented following fragmented approaches for specific application domains, introducing difficulties in providing unified solutions. However, the unification of solutions is an important feature from an IoT perspective. In this paper, we present an IoT platform that supports multiple application layer communication protocols (Representational State Transfer (REST)/HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), and Websockets) and that is composed of open-source frameworks (RabbitMQ, Ponte, OM2M, and RDF4J). We have explored a back-end system that interoperates with the various frameworks and offers a single approach for user-access control on IoT data streams and micro-services. The proposed platform is evaluated using its containerized version, being easily deployable on the vast majority of modern computing infrastructures. Its design promotes service reusability and follows a marketplace architecture, so that the creation of interoperable IoT ecosystems with active contributors is enabled. All the platform's features are analyzed, and we discuss the results of experiments, with the multiple communication protocols being tested when used interchangeably for transferring data. Developing unified solutions using such a platform is of interest to users and developers as they can test and evaluate local instances or even complex applications composed of their own IoT resources before releasing a production version to the marketplace.", "LeviProps are tangible structures used to create interactive mid-air experiences. They are composed of an acoustically-transparent lightweight piece of fabric and attached beads that act as levitated anchors. This combination enables real-time 6 Degrees-of-Freedom control of levitated structures which are larger and more diverse than those possible with previous acoustic manipulation techniques. LeviProps can be used as free-form interactive elements and as projection surfaces. We developed an authoring tool to support the creation of LeviProps. Our tool considers the outline of the prop and the user constraints to compute the optimum locations for the anchors (i.e. maximizing trapping forces), increasing prop stability and maximum size. The tool produces a final LeviProp design which can be fabricated following a simple procedure. This paper explains and evaluates our approach and showcases example applications, such as interactive storytelling, games and mid-air displays.", "In recent years, designers have pointed to the role of institutioning, the way in which design processes and institutions are mutually shaped, constrained and enabled. This paper seeks to expand this discussion to the field of grassroots communities, a concept that enlightens the intersection between geographic communities and communities of interests/practice. The research draws on empirical work exploring the different experiences in four distinct socio-cultural and institutional contexts of Uganda, Ireland, Portugal and Romania to investigate how institutioning relate to the design of a new form of community radio based on an innovative technology. It also explores what are the practices that designers and grassroots communities use to manage and navigate potential constraints of institutioning, and offers comparative insight into how institutioning influences the design outcome. Using the concept of institutioning, we will show how, in this interaction, the grassroots communities in the making overcome the \"space vs interest\" dichotomy, and how institutions as well as communities play a role in shaping - and are potentially shaped by - the design process.", "Multisensory experiences have been increasingly applied in Human-Computer Interaction (Ha). In recent years, it is commonplace to notice the development of haptic, olfactory, and even gustatory displays to create more immersive experiences. Companies are proposing new additions to the multisensory world and are unveiling new products that promise to offer amazing experiences exploiting mulsemedia-multiple sensorial media-where users can perceive odors, tastes, and the sensation of wind blowing against their face. Whilst researchers, practitioners and users alike are faced with a wide range of such new devices, relatively little work has been undertaken to summarize efforts and initiatives in this area. The current article addresses this shortcoming in two ways: first, by presenting a survey of devices targeting senses beyond that of sight and hearing and, second, by describing an approach to guide newcomers and experienced practitioners alike to build their own mulsemedia environment, both in a desktop setting and in an immersive 360 degrees environment.", "Effective fishery management measures to protect fish spawning aggregations require reliable information on the spatio-temporal distribution of spawning. Spawning closures have been part of a suite of fishery management actions to rebuild the Gulf of Maine stock of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), but difficulties remain with managing rebuilding. The objective of this study was to identify the spatial and temporal distribution of cod spawning during winter in Massachusetts Bay to improve our understanding of cod spawning dynamics and inform fisheries management. Spawning was investigated in collaboration with commercial fishermen during three winter spawning seasons (October 2013-March 2016) using acoustic telemetry and passive acoustic monitoring equipment deployed in fixed-station arrays and mounted on mobile autonomous gliders. Tagged cod exhibited spawning site fidelity and spawning primarily occurred from early November through January with a mid-December peak and some inter-annual variability. The spatial distribution of spawning was generally consistent among years with multiple hotspots in areas >50m depth. Current closures encompass most of spawning, but important areas are recommended for potential modifications. Utilizing multiple complementary technologies and deployment strategies in collaboration with commercial fishermen enabled a comprehensive description of spawning and provides a valuable model for future studies.", "Farmers, agencies, agricultural research community and firms require access to tools to analyze and estimate stressed and productive regions to obtain higher yield. At present, this is performed manually using visual interpretation. Recently there has been some development in the detection and mapping of the stressed crop by use of hyperspectral analysis; but, there is an information gap between farmers and information about the location of the crop under stress in the given area. There is an urgent need to provide a robust solution to identify the stressed region in the agricultural area. To address this, a unique application called as VegNet (Vegetative-Network) has been developed, which aims to provide the necessary tools to detect stressed crop locations using the spectral images obtained from UAVs, and provide stressed crops condition, location and area covered by those stressed crops. In this paper, a combination of spectral vegetation indices techniques has been highlighted to produce a comprehensive solution for precision agriculture using a UAV and VegNet. This incorporates several algorithms; segmentation, Canny-edge detector, dilation, gap-filling, image extraction and locating the stressed region using spectral modelling based Graphical User Interface (GUI) application for precision agriculture, societal benefit and Environmental research.", "Nineteen million Americans have significant vision loss. Over 70% of these are not employed full-time, and more than a quarter live below the poverty line. Globally, there are 36 million blind people, but less than half use white canes or more costly commercial sensory substitutions. The quality of life for visually impaired people is hampered by the resultant lack of independence. To help alleviate these challenges this study reports on the development of a low-cost, open-source ultrasound-based navigational support system in the form of a wearable bracelet to allow people with the lost vision to navigate, orient themselves in their surroundings and avoid obstacles when moving. The system can be largely made with digitally distributed manufacturing using low-cost 3-D printing/milling. It conveys point-distance information by utilizing the natural active sensing approach and modulates measurements into haptic feedback with various vibration patterns within the four-meter range. It does not require complex calibrations and training, consists of the small number of available and inexpensive components, and can be used as an independent addition to traditional tools. Sighted blindfolded participants successfully demonstrated the device for nine primary everyday navigation and guidance tasks including indoor and outdoor navigation and avoiding collisions with other pedestrians.", "The increasing development of urban centers brings serious challenges for traffic management. In this paper, we introduce a smart visual sensor, developed for a pilot project taking place in the Australian city of Liverpool (NSW). The project's aim was to design and evaluate an edge-computing device using computer vision and deep neural networks to track in real-time multi-modal transportation while ensuring citizens' privacy. The performance of the sensor was evaluated on a town center dataset. We also introduce the interoperable Agnosticity framework designed to collect, store and access data from multiple sensors, with results from two real-world experiments.", "This paper describes the development and validation of the currently smallest aerial platform with olfaction capabilities. The developed Smelling Nano Aerial Vehicle (SNAV) is based on a lightweight commercial nano-quadcopter (27 g) equipped with a custom gas sensing board that can host up to two in situ metal oxide semiconductor (MOX) gas sensors. Due to its small form-factor, the SNAV is not a hazard for humans, enabling its use in public areas or inside buildings. It can autonomously carry out gas sensing missions of hazardous environments inaccessible to terrestrial robots and bigger drones, for example searching for victims and hazardous gas leaks inside pockets that form within the wreckage of collapsed buildings in the aftermath of an earthquake or explosion. The first contribution of this work is assessing the impact of the nano-propellers on the MOX sensor signals at different distances to a gas source. A second contribution is adapting the bout' detection algorithm, proposed by Schmuker et al. (2016) to extract specific features from the derivative of the MOX sensor response, for real-time operation. The third and main contribution is the experimental validation of the SNAV for gas source localization (GSL) and mapping in a large indoor environment (160 m(2)) with a gas source placed in challenging positions for the drone, for example hidden in the ceiling of the room or inside a power outlet box. Two GSL strategies are compared, one based on the instantaneous gas sensor response and the other one based on the bout frequency. From the measurements collected (in motion) along a predefined sweeping path we built (in less than 3 min) a 3D map of the gas distribution and identified the most likely source location. Using the bout frequency yielded on average a higher localization accuracy than using the instantaneous gas sensor response (1.38 m versus 2.05 m error), however accurate tuning of an additional parameter (the noise threshold) is required in the former case. The main conclusion of this paper is that a nano-drone has the potential to perform gas sensing tasks in complex environments.", null, "During the last decade, a very small-standardized satellite, the Cubesat, emerged as a low-cost fast-development tool for space and technology research. Although its genesis is related to education, the change in paradigm presented by this satellite platform has motivated several countries, institutions, and companies to invest in a variety of technologies, aimed at improving Cubesat capabilities, while lowering costs of space missions. Following that trend, Latin American institutions, mostly universities, has started to develop Cubesat missions. This article describes some of the Latin American projects in this area. In particular, we discuss the achievements and scientific grounds upon which the first Cubesat projects in Chile were based and the implications that those projects have had on pursuing satellite-based research in the country and in collaboration with other countries of the region.

Determining such a set of inputs for individual IP blocks in a design is expensive in cost and time, and is also highly error prone. Additionally, it is desirable to identify IP instances in a design, where these simulation conditions are not met. These are relevant problems in the context of modern day microprocessor designs, which are designed using a very large number of IPs, either developed in-house or sourced from external vendors. In this paper, we examine these problems in an industrial context and introduce FVCAG, a framework for enabling efficient and accurate power modelling. FVCAG enables a more thorough IP power modelling than that can be accomplished using current state of the art techniques. Experimental evaluation of the proposed framework on the standard cell library and macros used in the design of an industry class high performance microprocessor design demonstrates the accuracy and efficiency of proposed framework.", "Current progress in wearable and implanted health monitoring technologies has strong potential to alter the future of healthcare services by enabling ubiquitous monitoring of patients. A typical health monitoring system consists of a network of wearable or implanted sensors that constantly monitor physiological parameters. Collected data are relayed using existing wireless communication protocols to a base station for additional processing. This article provides researchers with information to compare the existing low-power communication technologies that can potentially support the rapid development and deployment of WBAN systems, and mainly focuses on remote monitoring of elderly or chronically ill patients in residential environments.", "An approach for long term localization, stabilization, and navigation of micro-aerial vehicles (MAVs) in unknown environment is presented in this paper. The proposed method relies strictly on onboard sensors of employed MAVs and does not require any external positioning system. The core of the method consists in extraction of information from pictures consequently captured using a camera carried by the particular MAV. Visual features are obtained from images of the surface under the MAV, and stored into a map that is represented by these features. The position of the MAV is then obtained through matching with previously stored features. An important part of the proposed system is a novel approach for exploration and mapping of the workspace of robots. This method enables efficient exploring of the unknown environment, while keeping the iteratively built map of features consistent. The proposed algorithm is suitable for mapping of surfaces, both outdoor and indoor, with various density of the image features. The sufficient precision and long term persistence of the method allows its utilization for stabilization of large MAV groups that work in formations with small relative distances between particular vehicles. Numerous experiments with quadrotor helicopters and various numerical simulations have been realized for verification of the entire system and its components.", "Electrical stimulation (ES) of cells has been shown to induce a variety of responses, such as cytoskeleton rearrangements, migration, proliferation, and differentiation. In this study, we have investigated whether monophasic and biphasic pulsed ES could exert any effect on the proliferation and differentiation of human cardiac progenitor cells (hCPCs) isolated from human heart fragments. Cells were cultured under continuous exposure to monophasic or biphasic ES with fixed cycles for 1 or 3 days. Results indicate that neither stimulation protocol affected cell viability, while the cell shape became more elongated and reoriented more perpendicular to the electric field direction. Moreover, the biphasic ES clearly induced the upregulation of early cardiac transcription factors, MEF2D, GATA-4, and Nkx2.5, as well as the de novo expression of the late cardiac sarcomeric proteins, troponin T, cardiac alpha actinin, and SERCA 2a. Both treatments increased the expression of connexin 43 and its relocation to the cell membrane, but biphasic ES was faster and more effective. Finally, when hCPCs were exposed to both monophasic and biphasic ES, they expressed de novo the mRNA of the voltage-dependent calcium channel Cav 3.1((1G)) subunit, which is peculiar of the developing heart. Taken together, these results show that ES alone is able to set the conditions for early differentiation of adult hCPCs toward a cardiac phenotype.", "Common conceptions of user production overstate its novelty while understating its variety. To respond to these lacks, this article develops an analytic map that enables a more nuanced historical and critical understanding and investigation of user production. Historical approaches are well suited for capturing the multifarious forms of user production while also avoiding the problem of a-historicism. The article develops a contextual typology of user production by theorizing it as a cultural form. Primary forms discussed include those of buyer; source, subject, interviewee; contestant; supplier; financier; inventor; activist; and member, all of which are related to their generative formations and conditions. The article concludes by suggesting the kinds of questions and studies that such a framework makes possible.", "In this paper, we present an opportunistic service recommendation scheme in a place with smart objects to provide users with appropriate composite services to accomplish their task goals. The proposed scheme infers possible tasks from interactions that people have experienced with smart objects including other places that are similar to a given place. The proposed scheme then evaluates the candidate tasks by measuring quality satisfaction of each task against given QoS constraints. We test the proposed scheme on our three smart testbeds where various smart objects equipped. Experiment results show that the proposed scheme finds potential tasks in the testbeds in a reasonable time.", "Open architectures like the one recently unveiled by Facebook allow a detailed assessment of the energy efficiency of commercial data centers. This paper explores the fit of Zipf-like distributions typical of network traffic, to updates of user pages and the entity graph, for the new Facebook data center network architecture. We find that network resource consumption could be reduced by as much as 40-50% through several changes, either to the software, or to the data center design. Of these, employing a connected hub-and-spoke subgraph representation for each popular node, with each pod operating locally on its node of the subgraph, appears to hold the most energy savings potential. This work is part of a larger effort to more completely characterize the efficiency of data center computer- and network architectures beyond the normal reporting of facility power utilization efficiency (PUE), which is blind to energy proportionality and other aspects of the efficiency within the computer- and network architecture, or IT portion, of the data center.", "The direction of sunshine or the installation sites of environmental control facilities in the greenhouse result in different temperature and humidity levels in the various zones of the greenhouse, and thus, the production quality of crop is inconsistent. This study proposed a wireless-networked decentralized fuzzy control scheme to regulate the environmental parameters of various culture zones within a greenhouse. The proposed scheme can create different environmental conditions for cultivating different crops in various zones and achieve diversification or standardization of crop production. A star-type wireless sensor network is utilized to communicate with each sensing node, actuator node, and control node in various zones within the greenhouse. The fuzzy rule-based inference system is used to regulate the environmental parameters for temperature and humidity based on real-time data of plant growth response provided by a growth stage selector. The growth stage selector defines the control ranges of temperature and humidity of the various culture zones according to the leaf area of the plant, the number of leaves, and the cumulative amount of light. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme is stable and robust and provides basis for future greenhouse applications.", "Video surveillance is an essential tool for many security-related applications but video is also increasingly used in combination with computer vision technologies in other sensing applications. With the growth of installed camera infrastructure and development it would be beneficial to enable video surveillance systems to support many application simultaneously. Service-oriented Architecture (SoA) is a prospective solution to implement such a multi-application surveillance system, which can provide video data and processing methods to different applications based on their requirements. However, such a system presents several challenges, which needs to be addressed and considered along with the constrains on the system resources. In this paper, we propose a framework for a SoA based video surveillance system with efficient system resource management, including device, data and network management. Our contribution is to present the benefits of such an approach and highlight the research challenges that need to be adressed to realise such a system.", "This paper introduces the design and practical validation of a quaternion control scheme to globally stabilize a quadrotor aerial vehicle. First an attitude control law is proposed to stabilize the vehicle's heading, then a position control law is developed to stabilize the vehicle around a desired point. Using position references, a smooth trajectory is calculated for the attitude controller such that the position of the vehicle becomes stable. The proposed control algorithm allows a linear quadrotor system's behavior. The closed-loop system is then numerically simulated to corroborate stability.", "A new industrial revolution is undergoing, based on a number of technological paradigms. The will to foster and guide this phenomenon has been summarized in the expression \"Industry 4.0\" (I4.0). Initiatives under this term share the vision that many key technologies underlying Cyber-Physical Systems and Big Data Analytics are converging to a new distributed, highly automated, and highly dynamic production network, and that this process needs regulatory and cultural advancements to effectively and timely develop. In this work, we focus on the technological aspect only, highlighting the unprecedented complexity of I4.0 emerging from the scientific literature. While previous works have focused on one or up to four related enablers, we consider ten technological enablers, including besides the most cited Big Data, Internet of Things, and Cloud Computing, also others more rarely considered as Fog and Mobile Computing, Artificial Intelligence, Human-Computer Interaction, Robotics, down to the often overlooked, very recent, or taken for granted Open-Source Software, Blockchain, and the Internet. For each we explore the main characteristics in relation to I4.0 and its interdependencies with other enablers. Finally we provide a detailed analysis of challenges in leveraging each of the enablers in I4.0, evidencing possible roadblocks to be overcome and pointing at possible future directions of research. Our goal is to provide a reference for the experts in some of the technological fields involved, for a reconnaissance of integration and hybridization possibilities with other fields in the endeavor of I4.0, as well as for the laymen, for a high-level grasp of the variety (and often deep history) of the scientific research backing I4.0.", "Robotics provides useful tools for educational purposes, allowing to engage students in learning within disparate domains, from computer science and artificial intelligence - traditionally the main domains for educational robotics - to general education, human and social sciences and arts. Robots can be used with different purposes, from being simple tools to be programmed with some specific behaviour, to being peers with whom to engage in a fruitful interaction for a collaborative learning purpose. In this sense, they can also foster learning of transversal skills such as communication and cooperation. In this article, we propose robot swarms as a novel educational tool to target exactly those transversal skills that are difficult to account otherwise. The usage of multiple robots interacting to solve a common problem can support the learning of concepts related to cooperation and collective actions and can make accessible notions about complex systems that are common in physical, biological, economic and social sciences. Additionally, the possibility to interact and participate in the collective behaviour displayed by the robot swarm can strongly increase the comprehension and engagement with the proposed concept. Motivated by this picture, we propose a roadmap for the utilization of swarm robotics for educational purposes, which is hinged on the Thymio robot, a simple but powerful educational robot that presents all the features required for swarm robotics experimentation. We propose two case studies and we substantiate the proposal with preliminary results from a demonstration of robot swarms performed during a recent robotics festival.", "This paper proposes a real-time embedded system for joint space control of omnidirectional mobile robots. Actuators driving an omnidirectional mobile robot are connected in a line topology which requires synchronization to move simultaneously in translation and rotation. We employ EtherCAT, a real-time Ethernet network, to control servo controllers for the mobile robot. The first part of this study focuses on the design of a low-cost embedded system utilizing an open-source EtherCAT master. Although satisfying real-time constraints is critical, a desired trajectory on the center of the mobile robot should be decomposed into the joint space to drive the servo controllers. For the center of the robot, a convolution-based path planner and a corresponding joint space control algorithm are presented considering its physical limits. To avoid obstacles that introduce geometric constraints on the curved path, a trajectory generation algorithm considering high curvature turning points is adapted for an omnidirectional mobile robot. Tracking a high curvature path increases mathematical complexity, which requires precise synchronization between the actuators of the mobile robot. An improvement of the distributed clockthe synchronization mechanism of EtherCAT for slavesis presented and applied to the joint controllers of the mobile robot. The local time of the EtherCAT master is dynamically adjusted according to the drift of the reference slave, which minimizes the synchronization error between each joint. Experiments are conducted on our own developed four-wheeled omnidirectional mobile robot. The experiment results confirm that the proposed system is very effective in real-time control applications for precise motion control of the robot even for tracking high curvature paths.", "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are growing in popularity, and recent technological advances are fostering the development of new applications for these devices. This paper discusses the use of aerial drones as a platform for deploying a gunshot surveillance system based on an array of microphones. Notwithstanding the difficulties associated with the inherent additive noise from the rotating propellers, this application brings an important advantage: the possibility of estimating the shooter position solely based on the muzzle blast sound, with the support of a digital map of the terrain. This work focuses on direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation methods applied to audio signals obtained from a microphone array aboard a flying drone. We investigate preprocessing and different DoA estimation techniques in order to obtain the setup that performs better for the application at hand. We use a combination of simulated and actual gunshot signals recorded using a microphone array mounted on a UAV. One of the key insights resulting from the field recordings is the importance of drone positioning, whereby all gunshots recorded in a region outside a cone open from the gun muzzle presented a hit rate close to 96%. Based on experimental results, we claim that reliable bearing estimates can be achieved using a microphone array mounted on a drone.", "In this paper, a method for the estimation of the angle of grasping of a human forearm, when grasped by a robot with an underactuated gripper, using proprioceptive information only, is presented. Knowing the angle around the forearm's axis (i.e. roll angle) is key for the safe manipulation of the human limb and biomedical sensor placement among others. The adaptive gripper has two independent underactuated fingers with two phalanges and a single actuator each. The final joint position of the gripper provides information related to the shape of the grasped object without the need for external contact or force sensors. Regression methods to estimate the roll angle of the grasping have been trained with forearm grasping information from different humans at each angular position. The results show that it is possible to accurately estimate the rolling angle of the human arm, for trained and unknown people.", "In recent years, smartphones have developed tumultuously; in fact, they have increasingly taken on the role of portable and compact personal computers equipped with a range of sensors and applications capable of monitoring, for example, physical activity, heartbeat and sleep. Their ability to manage and transmit data makes them a very interesting tool even in the scientific field, where the concept of \"lab in a phone\" is gaining ground.

The motion capture system Optitrack is used to localize the vehicle which is a nano-quadcopter Crazyflie 2.0. An interface was created to pass positioning data to the Robot Operating Software (ROS). ROS acts as communication layer to bridge between Optitrack and available control nodes for Crazyflie 2.0 platforms.", ["Public sector innovation is an important issue in the agenda of policymakers and academics but there is a need for a change of perspective, one that promotes a more open model of innovating, which takes advantage of the possibilities offered by collaboration between citizens, entrepreneurs and civil society as well as of new emerging technologies. Living labs are environments that can support public open innovation processes.", "This article makes a practical contribution to understand the role of living labs as intermediaries of public open innovation. The analysis focuses on the dynamics of these innovation intermediaries, their outcomes, and their main challenges. In particular, it adopts a qualitative approach (fourteen semi-structured interviews and one focus group were conducted) in order to analyze two living labs: Citilab in the city of Cornelia and the network of fab athenaeums (public fab labs) in the city of Barcelona, both in Spain. After a thorough analysis of the attributes of these living labs, the article concludes that 1) living labs provide the opportunity for public agencies to meet with private sector organizations and thus function as innovation intermediaries, 2) implementing an open innovation perspective is considered more important than obtaining specific innovation results, and 3) scalability and sustainability are the main problems living labs encounter as open innovation intermediaries.

Because it is a modern method, it provides increased comfort in monitoring electrical circuits in the long term, as well as reduced costs of implementing and developing laboratories. This paper deals with the efficiency of virtual instruments in monitoring electrical circuits as compared to that of conventional devices. The built equipment can measure three physical measures in real time and offers graphical representations for each value. This also offers a new perspective on new trends in didactic methodology for pupils.", "Traditionally, most irrigation practices in Southern Europe have been based on gravity-fed surface irrigation systems. Currently, these systems remain a relevant typology in the European Union (EU) member states of the Mediterranean areas, where it is often the only sustainable method for farmers due to the small size of agricultural holdings, their reduced capacity and readiness to invest and the low ratio between yield profits and irrigation costs. In the last several years, in response to European and national directives, surface irrigation has garnered increasing attention at the political and bureaucratic levels due to frequent criticisms of its postulated low efficiency and high water wastage. However, these systems commonly provide a number of ecosystem services and nature-based solutions that increase the positive externalities in different rural socio-ecological contexts and often have the potential to extend these services and provide solutions that are compatible with economical sustainability. This study aims to discuss the prospects for new practices and for the rehabilitation and modernization of the gravity-fed surface irrigation systems in EU Mediterranean areas to enhance water efficiency, thus gaining both economic advantages and environmental benefits. The difficulties, stimuli for improvements and peculiarities of the irrigation water management of four rural environments located in Italy, Spain and Portugal were analyzed and compared to the current state of the gravity-fed surface irrigation systems with hypothetical future improvements achievable by innovative technologies and practices. In these different case studies, the current gravity-fed surface irrigation systems have an obsolete regulatory structure; water-use efficiency is not a driving criterion for the management of the conveyance and distribution canal network, and farmers are not yet adequately encouraged to adopt more efficient gravity-fed irrigation practices. A continuous knowledge exchange is thus necessary for the interaction of all irrigation water managers and farmers to improve their eco-efficiency and to preserve and promote their cultural heritage across the entire water supply and delivery chains. We argue that the best way forward will require precisely targeted rehabilitation measures of gravity-fed surface irrigation systems based on the integrated use of decision support services, gate automation, remote and feedback controls and real-time flow optimization.", "This paper presents the design, implementation, and incorporation of an educational control system platform in an introductory course on control systems, with the goal of relating abstract concepts involved in this course to a real-world engineering system. This study builds upon the previously published attempt by the author involving design of a general control system platform for position-controlling of a shaft. In the present work, the need for incorporating a hardware-based hands-on project for teaching control systems is discussed first. Then, the contents of the undergraduate senior-level course MECH 412 Control Systems and the way the course is organized around a master example are explained. In addition, this paper elaborates on the challenges involved with introducing the concept of microprocessors to the mechanical engineering students taking MECH 412. The term project, which is founded on the master example in question, is discussed in details with emphasis on the objectives and learning outcomes, and evaluation. In the results section, the outcomes of the implementation of the proposed platform during the Fall 2016 semester are presented. These outcomes include the various types of controllers students selected to design, the observations they made for each type of controller, samples of submitted codes, and evaluation of the students' learning outcomes. The evaluation includes the statistical analysis of pre and post-test questionnaire completed by the students at the beginning and end of the semester, respectively. The reason why a control group could not be secured is explained in detail. The statistical analysis shows a significant improvement in the mechanical engineering students' degree of the confidence in using tools that are traditionally perceived to be for electrical engineers.", "This paper reports on a review of the European literature about the impacts of having an electrically-assisted bike available to use, together with results from a trial in the UK city of Brighton, where 80 employees were loaned an electrically-assisted bike for a 6-8 week period. In the Brighton trial, three-quarters of those who were loaned an e-bike used them at least once a week. Across the sample as a whole, average usage was in the order of 1520 miles per week, and was accompanied by an overall reduction in car mileage of 20%. At the end of the trial, 38% participants expected to cycle more in the future, and at least 70% said that they would like to have an e-bike available for use in the future, and would cycle more if this was the case. This is consistent with the results of the European literature which shows that when e-bikes are made available, they get used; that a proportion of e-bike trips typically substitutes for car use; and that many people who take part in trials become interested in future e-bike use, or cycling more generally.

They offer open- source blueprints of the electric conversion kits globally. The authors analysed the CoP by considering its entire life cycle, starting from the motives for its establishment, through its active performance, up to the current stage, where the members need to decide whether the community will remain viable. Particular attention was paid to the group dynamics and issues that seemed relevant to the change in dynamics which determine whether a CoP maintains its vitality or dissipates.", "Design/methodology/approach - The qualitative case study was chosen as the research strategy (Yin, 1984) to answer the research question and understand the target phenomenon of the CoP by analysing textual data. This particular case was chosen because of its unusual revelatory value for the case CoP which aims at creating a tangible innovation by using a platform that normally aims at intangible problem- solving (Eisenhardt and Graebner, 2007). In the data collection, the authors used method and researcher triangulation (Patton, 1990).", "Findings - Life cycle analysis revealed four themes that explained the change in the group dynamics and the dispersal of the community: differentiation and dispersal of interests, growth that resulted in role differentiation, virtuality in community development and inclusion of investors. The themes were all related to the fact that the case community operated with not only knowledge, but also with a tangible product. Therefore, the tangibility of a problem to be solved seems to play a pivotal role in a CoP's operations and dynamics and, in part, also explains the changing role of information and communications technology (ICT) in the process.", "Research limitations/implications - However, this paper identified also different ways to characterize community participation, which was also relevant from group dynamics point of view. Thus, the topic should be studied further. Group dynamics in general, as it relates to the success of CoPs, should be also investigated further. Additional studies should implement the inclusion of external resources in the community. Further research is also needed to investigate tangible and intangible outcomes achieved through CoPs. Much of the available research was conducted over short periods; prolonged interactions in a CoP context could show different results.", "Practical implications - In conclusion, at the beginning of the life cycle of the eCars community, ICT played a significant role. It helped increase awareness of the community in the first place and enabled people to join in, which thus enabled the community to evolve. When the operations evolved and the life cycle progressed, both the physical meeting place as well as personal interaction and communication became emphasized and much more important. In the maturing stage, the role of ICT, and especially social media, is the essential part of the community.", "Social implications - This analysis suggests that at the early stage of a community, the plans can be somewhat random, even utopian, but when the community evolves, this uncertainty can become a problem. First, it affects achieving the actual, and in this case, concrete results. Second, uncertainty and unclarity dampen enthusiasm and motivation, which are of utmost importance due to the voluntary participation. This paper also concludes that when the operations evolved and the life cycle progressed, both the physical meeting place as well as personal interaction and communication became increasingly important.", "Originality/value - This paper argues that the ideological basis for this kind of community should be openness. All information should be available for everyone who registers to the community platform on the internet. This community was working in the mindset of open innovation. Technical documentation and all other material were available for everyone in the community's wiki pages, which attracted a lot of people who were delighted by eCars. Many advisors delivered technical information and good advice to the practitioners of the community through the platform. The hang arounds were also very well-informed in this stage regarding how the core group was working."], "The issues about navigation precision and indoor hovering of micro aerial vehicles (MAV) have been discussed frequently nowadays. This practical study presented a dedicated design for indoor hovering that is more precise than using GPS positioning.

The practical results showed the proposed scheme could reduce the errors of navigation parameters and achieve stable hovering performance under different conditions of lighting.", null, "Biological processes are inherently multi-scale, and supramolecular complexes at the nanoscale determine changes at the cellular scale and beyond. Single-molecule localizationmicroscopy (SMLM)(1-3) techniques have been established as important tools for studying cellular features with resolutions of the order of around 10 nm. However, in their current form these modalities are limited by a highly constrained field of view (FOV) and field-dependent image resolution. Here, we develop a low-cost microlens array (MLA)-based epi-illumination system-flat illumination for field-independent imaging (FIFI)-that can efficiently and homogeneously perform simultaneous imaging of multiple cells with nanoscale resolution. The optical principle of FIFI, which is an extension of the Kohler integrator, is further elucidated and modelled with a new, free simulation package. We demonstrate FIFI's capabilities by imaging multiple COS-7 and bacteria cells in 100 x 100 mu m(2) SMLM images-more than quadrupling the size of a typical FOV and producing near-gigapixel-sized images of uniformly high quality.", "Historically, open source agriculture (OSA) was based on grassroots technology generally manufactured by hand tools or with manual machining. The rise of distributed digital manufacturing provides an opportunity for much more rapid lateral scaling of open source appropriate technologies for agriculture. However, the most mature distributed manufacturing area is plastic, which has limited use for many OSA applications. To overcome this limitation with design, this study reports on of a completely 3D-printable planetary roller screw linear actuator. The device is designed as a parametric script-based computer aided design (CAD) package to allow for the easy adaption for a number of applications such as food processing at different scales. The planetary roller screw is fabricated in dishwasher-safe polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) on an open source machine and tested using an open source testing platform to determine if it could maintain a constant load without slipping and the maximum force. Then, this output is compared to a direct screw press using the same materials. The results found that the maximum force is more than doubled for the roller screw actuator using the same materials, making them adequate for some food processing techniques. Future work is outlined to improve the performance and ease of assembly.", "This paper presents a single-copter localization system as a first step towards a scalable multihop drone swarm localization system. The drone was equipped with ultrawideband (UWB) transceiver modules, which can be used for communication, as well as distance measurement. The location of the drone was detected based on fixed anchor points using a single type of UWB transceiver. Our aim is to create a swarm localization system that enables drones to switch their role between an active swarm member and an anchor node to enhance the localization of the whole swarm. To this end, this paper presents our current baseline localization system and its performance regarding single-drone localization with fixed anchors and its integration into our current modular quadcopters, which was designed to be easily extendable to a swarm localization system. The distance between each drone and the anchors was measured periodically, and a specially tailored gradient descent algorithm was used to solve the resulting nonlinear optimization problem. Additional copter and wireless-specific adaptations were performed to enhance the robustness. The system was tested with a Vicon system as a position reference and showed a high precision of 0.2 m with an update rate of Hz. Additionally, the system was integrated into the FINken copters of the SwarmLab and evaluated in multiple outdoor scenarios. These scenarios showed the generic usability of the approach, even though no accurate precision measurement was possible.", "The recent developments in electronics have made available a variety of systems at very appealing quality, cost and size levels. These conditions are not left unexploited by modern agriculture that seeks to tackle the increased global food demand and the degradation of available resources. Indeed, the precision agriculture sector is flourishing assisted by outstanding innovations, like the UAVs, that can carry a plethora of sensors. It must be noted though that, despite the progress being achieved, several high-quality measurements still demand expensive, often pre-existing but heavy instruments, and meticulous time-consuming operations. The latter requirements are not always in-line with the flight duration and cargo weight limitations of a typical UAV. This gap is apparent when scientists have to apply precise thermal imagery methods to support actions like accurate plant inspection or early disease detection. In order to provide a satisfactory solution, an experimental electric robotic platform, mainly destined for spraying operations, was enhanced so as to improve its functions and to host a high-quality thermal/optical camera. This platform has been equipped with a set of complementary electronic systems so as to provide fluent and robust semi-autonomous remote monitoring operation. The overall layout is lightweight, eliminating soil compaction, reducing vibration and thermal footprint, guarantying almost noninvasive operation and image capturing at very low noise levels. The whole approach is targeting to combine innovative but easy-to-find assistive components of affordable cost in local markets, emphasizing the challenges towards a really functioning solution accompanied by detailed performance data. The overall study is targeting the rapidly growing robotic vehicles market. The proposed platform is following the modern sustainability objectives as it is fully electric and can be assisted by solar panels, for increased autonomy. Finally, insight is given for future improvements and exploitation.", "Three-dimensional (3D) printing in soil science is relatively rare but offers promising directions for research. Having 3D-printed soil samples will help academics and researchers conduct experiments in a reproducible and participatory research network and gain a better understanding of the studied soil parameters. One of the most important challenges in utilizing 3D printing techniques for soil modeling is the manufacturing of a soil structure. Until now, the most widespread method for printing porous soil structures is based on scanning a real sample via X-ray tomography. The aim of this paper is to design a porous soil structure based on mathematical models rather than on samples themselves. This can allow soil scientists to design and parameterize their samples according to their desired experiments. An open-source toolchain is developed using a Lua script, in the IceSL slicer, with graphical user interface to enable researchers to create and configure their digital soil models, called monoliths, without using meshing algorithms or STL files which reduce the resolution of the model. Examples of monoliths are 3D-printed in polylactic acid using fused filament fabrication technology with a layer thickness of 0.20, 0.12, and 0.08 mm. The images generated from the digital model slicing are analyzed using open-source ImageJ software to obtain information about internal geometrical shape, porosity, tortuosity, grain size distribution, and hydraulic conductivities. The results show that the developed script enables designing reproducible numerical models that imitate soil structures with defined pore and grain sizes in a range between coarse sand (from 1 mm diameter) to fine gravel (up to 12 mm diameter).", "In this article, we designed and implemented neural controllers to control a nonlinear and unstable magnetic levitation system composed of an electromagnet and a magnetic disk. The objective was to evaluate the implementation and performance of neural control algorithms in a low-cost hardware. In a first phase, we designed two classical controllers with the objective to provide the training data for the neural controllers. After, we identified several neural models of the levitation system using Nonlinear AutoRegressive eXogenous (NARX)-type neural networks that were used to emulate the forward dynamics of the system. Finally, we designed and implemented three neural control structures: the inverse controller, the internal model controller, and the model reference controller for the control of the levitation system. The neural controllers were tested on a low-cost Arduino control platform through MATLAB/Simulink. The experimental results proved the good performance of the neural controllers.", "The application of photovoltaic (PV) systems has been increasing rapidly worldwide in the field of sustainable electricity generation. However, the efficiency of PV systems depends significantly on the orientation of solar PV modules. To enhance the efficiency of PV systems, previous studies focused mainly on the development of sensor based solar tracking systems using sun position sensors. In particular, they used light-dependent resistors (LDRs), which detect the visible light spectrum. However, LDRs have significant limitations (e.g., saturation of light intensity and ineffectiveness under low-visibility conditions) that can adversely affect the solar tracking performance. Utilization of ultraviolet (UV) spectrum captured by UV sensors displays the potential for overcoming the limitations of LDRs. This is owing to the enhancement of UV radiation by the cloud effect during overcast conditions and the capability of UV sensors. Considering this, we propose a novel UV sensor-based dual-axis solar tracking system to improve tracking movements and PV energy generation by utilizing the advantages of UV radiation enhancement and UV sensor capability. Four intensity signals of UV radiation obtained by UV sensors are compared and employed as inputs to the solar tracking system after it is implemented on a pseudo-azimuthal mounting structure, which is capable of following the sun trajectory through daily and elevation angles. A comparative analysis is performed to evaluate the solar tracking performance of the proposed solar tracking system with respect to that of a fixed flat-plate system and conventional LDR-based solar tracking system. The experimental results reveal that our tracking system increases energy generation (after accounting for the operational energy consumption) by 19.97% and 11.00% compared with the fixed flat-plate system and LDRbased solar tracking system, respectively. Moreover, the proposed solar tracking system performs effectively in terms of movement tracking under the tested conditions. Finally, the economic performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed tracking system is profitable.", "This paper presents aspects of the concept and design of prostheses for the upper limb. The objective of this research is that of prototyping a customized prosthesis, with EMG signals that initiate the motion. The prosthesis' fingers' motions (as well as that of its hand and forearm parts) are driven by micro-motors, and assisted by the individualized command and control system. The software and hardware tandem concept of this mechatronic system enables complex motion (in the horizontal and vertical plane) with accurate trajectory and different set rules (gripping pressure, object temperature, acceleration towards the object). One important idea is regarding customization via reverse engineering techniques. Due to this, the dimensions and appearance (geometric characteristics) of the prosthesis would look like the human hand itself. The trajectories and motions of the fingers, thumbs, and joints have been studied by kinematic analysis with the matrix-vector method aided by Matlab. The concept and design of the mechanical parts allow for complex finger motion-rotational motion in two planes. The command and control system is embedded, and data received from the sensors are processed by a micro-controller for managing micro-motor control. Preliminary testing of the sensors and micro-motors on a small platform, Arduino, was performed. Prototyping of the mechanical components has been a challenge because of the high accuracy needed for the geometric precision of the parts. Several techniques of rapid prototyping were considered, but only DLP (digital light processing) proved to be the right one.", "The necessity of making smart devices, intelligent processing and informative communication has taken the Internet of things (IoT) to a new level. Various industries have been implementing IoT-based services to increase the throughput as well as for information management and analysis. Such IoT-based systems with the use of cloud computing and big data analytics are now approaching toward the field of wind energy, one of the most promising, environment friendly and clean renewable energy sources.

The prime contribution of this review paper is that it summarizes the current state of the art of IoT-based applications in the wind energy conversion systems.", "The ability to provide handset tracking or positioning system independent from the available commercial mobile network is required in emergency. In some cases, it is possible that the commercial mobile networks are suspended due to the natural disaster, terrorist attack or other emergency condition. The commercial mobile networks might also unavailable in the remote areas where some extreme sports or research exploration take place. During emergency evacuation, detecting handset location might be a big help for the rescue team to loacte the victim. This work analyzes the system architecture of OpenBTS and AirProbe GSM-Receiver, and proposed a way to achieve affordable mobile phone positioning with these open source platform. The target is to build a cost-effective prototype which able to detect handset position more precisely. An effective approach to increase the positioning accuracy is also presented.

We compare how the two platforms differ in using the filesystem, using the database, and accessing the storage. We collected the IOs from select seven different apps that are commonly available on both platforms. By analyzing the collected the IOs on both platforms, a dominant fraction of writes are 4 KB synchronous. On Android and Tizen, respectively, 65% and 45% of all write IO counts 4 KB; 47% and 75% of all writes accesses are SQLite related files such as database, rollback journal, WAL (Write Ahead Log), and etc.; 81% and 86% of all IOs are random accesses; and 90% and 52% of all writes counts are synchronous IO mode.

Biological evidences showed that there is a two-way interaction between the Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) and the body in the locomotion process of animals. Therefore, the development of bin-inspired controllers seems to be a good and robust way to obtain an efficient and robust robotic locomotion. This contribution presents an innovative hybrid controller that generates locomotion through the combination of CPGs and reflexes. The results show that the hybrid controller is capable of producing stable quadruped locomotion with a regular stepping pattern. Furthermore, it proved to be able to deal with slopes without changing the parameters and with small obstacles, overcoming them successfully. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Nevertheless the number, quality and spacial resolution of surveys is modest due to the absence of expressly addressed tools. In this paper the design, construction and testing of the first prototype of an innovative class of Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) for the extremely shallow water and remote areas of wetlands is presented.

SWAMP is also characterised by small draft soft-foam, unsinkable hull structure with high modularity and a flexible hardware/software architecture. Each hull can be considered as a single vehicle, being equipped with a full navigation, guidance and control package, as well as propulsion, power and communication systems.

Edge gateways, devices deployed at the edge of the network near the sensors, communicate with measurement stations using their proper protocol, receive and translate the messages to a standardized format, forward the data to the processing platform and provide local data buffering and preprocessing.

However, some barriers prevent equal access to this education. These obstacles include the lack of basic resources such as electricity and internet availability, which prevents appropriate training in the skills necessary for sustainable community development. Therefore, we have responded with the Solar-Powered Educational Learning Library (SolarSPELL) initiative, which offers a solar-powered digital library and provides an internet-like experience through its offline WiFi network. This educational innovation has been implemented in rural schools across the Pacific Islands, including in some of the more remote islands of Fiji, an area strongly affected by climate change. The objective of the study was to understand the impact of SolarSPELL on teaching and learning about climate change in the schools where it was implemented. This research used a case study method in which quantitative tools were applied to understand the characteristics of the schools and the impact of this educational innovation. The results showed that the SolarSPELL library was an impactful pedagogical resource in the schools where it was implemented. It served as support for teachers and motivated the students, promoted the democratization of knowledge in vulnerable areas, and provided appropriate educational resources to generate knowledge about problem-solving actions that can respond to climate change. The importance of this educational innovation lies in presenting strategies and best practices that help improve the quality of education, making it more inclusive and eliminating barriers to the acquisition of knowledge.", "We investigated changes in functional network architecture in amnestic mild cognitive impairment using graph-based analysis of task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging and fine cortical parcellation. Widespread disconnection was observed primarily in cortical hubs known to manifest early Alzheimer's disease pathology, namely precuneus, parietal lobules, supramarginal and angular gyri, and cuneus, with additional involvement of subcortical regions, sensorimotor cortex and insula. The connectivity changes determined using graph-based analysis significantly exceed those detected using independent component analysis both in amplitude and topographical extent, and are largely decoupled from the presence of overt atrophy. This superior ability of graph-based analysis to detect disease-related disconnection highlights its potential use in the determination of biomarkers of early dementia.

Advocating for better, healthier implementations of these technologies will require us to communicate abstract values, such as trust, to an audience that ranges from the general public to technologists and even policymakers. In this paper, we show how a combination of film-making and product design can help to illustrate these abstract values. Working as part of a wider international advocacy campaign, Our Friends Electric focuses on the voice enabled internet, translating abstract notions of Internet Health into comprehensible digital futures for the relationship between our voice and the internet.

In this new article, we argue that a new post-gross domestic product economy focusing on wellbeing rather than material output is already emerging in the Anthropocene, thanks to the convergence of policy reforms and economic shifts. At the policy level, the Sustainable Development Goals require policymakers to protect ecosystems, promote greater equality, and focus on long-term equitable development. At the economy level, the provision of services has outpaced industrial production as the key driver of prosperity, with innovative business models optimizing the match between supply and demand and giving rise to a burgeoning \"sharing economy\", which produces value to people while reducing output and costs. The economic transformation already underway is, however, delayed by an obsolete system of measurement of economic performance still dominated by the gross domestic product-based national accounts, which rewards the incumbent and disincentives the new. We show that a different approach to measuring wellbeing and prosperity is the \"missing link\" we need to connect recent evolutions in policy and the economy with a view to activating a sustainable development paradigm for a good Anthropocene.", ["Focusing on generalized sensor combinations, this paper deals with the attitude estimation problem using a linear complementary filter (CF). The quaternion observation model is obtained via a gradient descent algorithm. An additive measurement model is then established according to derived results. The filter is named as the generalized CF where the observation model is simplified as a linear one that is quite different from previous-reported brute-force nonlinear results. Moreover, we prove that representative derivative-based optimization algorithms are essentially equivalent to each other. Derivations are given to establish the state model based on the quaternion kinematic equation. The proposed algorithm is validated under several experimental conditions involving the free-living environment, harsh external field disturbances, and aerial flight test aided by robotic vision. Using the specially designed experimental devices, data acquisition and algorithm computations are performed to give comparisons on accuracy, robustness, time-consumption, and so on with representative methods. The results show that not only the proposed filter can give fast, accurate, and stable estimates in terms of various sensor combinations but also produces robust attitude estimation in the scenario of harsh situations, e. g., irregular magnetic distortion.", "Note to Practitioners-Multisensor attitude estimation is a crucial technique in robotic devices. Many existing methods focus on the orientation fusion of specific sensor combinations. In this paper, we make the problem more concise.

Such performance will be of benefit to robotic platforms requiring flexible and easy-to-tune attitude estimation in the future."], "This study aims to explore the influencing factors of multidisciplinary digital social innovation (DSI) in the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) member countries in light of the socio-technical system transition theory.

In short, it concludes that, if OECD member countries have high level of democracy and e-participation, high GDP and business-friendly environment, high social expenditure, and high level of ICT (Information and Communication Technology) development and patent applications, they are highly likely to achieve a sufficient level of digital social innovation. This study underlines that the result of combined arrangement explains that the DSI can be more properly characterized by the multi-level and structured approach of the socio-technical system transition that goes beyond the fragmentary approach of existing innovation theories and the current related academic field. Moreover, this study reveals that the social factors (including the social capital variable) that have attracted attention from previous studies may have little effect on the DSI. In essence, it suggests that citizen interaction and social change can be newly formed through technological innovation in a multi-dimensional way, and that more in-depth discussion regarding the new context of 'digital citizen' might be required.", "Heavy industrial machinery is a primary asset for the operation of key sectors such as construction, manufacturing, and logistics. Targeted attacks against these assets could result in incidents, fatal injuries, and substantial financial loss. Given the importance of such scenarios, we analyzed and evaluated the security implications of the technology used to operate and control this machinery, namely industrial radio remote controllers. We conducted the first-ever security analysis of this technology, which relies on proprietary radio-frequency protocols to implement remote-control functionalities. Through a two-phase evaluation approach we discovered important flaws in the design and implementation of industrial remote controllers. In this paper we introduce and describe 5 practical attacks affecting major vendors and multiple real-world installations. We conclude by discussing how a challenging responsible disclosure process resulted in first-ever security patches and improved security awareness.", "This paper proposes a UAV platform that autonomously detects, hunts, and takes down other small UAVs in GPS-denied environments. The platform detects, tracks, and follows another drone within its sensor range using a pre-trained machine learning model. We collect and generate a 58,647-image dataset and use it to train a Tiny YOLO detection algorithm. This algorithm combined with a simple visual-servoing approach was validated on a physical platform. Our platform was able to successfully track and follow a target drone at an estimated speed of 1.5 m/s. Performance was limited by the detection algorithm's 77% accuracy in cluttered environments and the frame rate of eight frames per second along with the field of view of the camera.", "While research in HCI on dealing with cultural issues when designing ICTs tended to adopt fixed and taxonomic views, recent theoretical perspectives closer to the social sciences have called for attending to the contingent, fluid, and dynamic aspects of the notion of culture. In this article, we contribute to translating these perspectives into an approach for informing design. We focus on abandoning prior conceptions of culture to allow the discovery of cultural differences through inductive field research while engaging with the target community. This allows a view on cultural difference that is generative for design: it is unique to each case, and it also remains close to the concerns of community members. We base our approach on Basile Zimmermann's (2015) waves and forms framework, and we illustrate it through our engagement and design with VOCI, a local voluntary community of tech-savvy university students in Syria between 2011 and 2015.", "Compromised power electronics, due to firmware attacks and hardware Trojans, in a flight computer can jeopardize the safety and security of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). They can maliciously alter sensor measurements or control commands to make a UAV to take disastrous moves. Unfortunately, most of these attacks are difficult to detect before deploying components in the system. Therefore, detecting compromised behavior run-time is important, while it is challenging at the same time. In this work, we propose to build machine learning-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) to be deployed at the power electronics/microcontorller level such that it can deal with malicious data/control commands initiated due to hard ware attacks.", "Internet-related electricity consumption is rising rapidly as global Internet users spend more than 6.5 h per day online. Open source ad blockers have the potential to reduce the time and thus electricity spent using computers by eliminating ads during Internet browsing and video streaming. In this study, three open source ad blockers are tested against a no-ad blocker control. Page load time is recorded for browsing a representative selection of the globally most-accessed websites, and the time spent watching ads on videos is quantified for both trending and non-trending content. The results show that page load time dropped 11% with AdBlock+, 22.2% with Privacy Badger, and 28.5% with uBlock Origin. Thus, uBlock Origin has the potential to save the average global Internet user more than 100 h annually. The energy conserved if everyone in the United States used the open source ad blocker would save over 36 Americans lives per year if it were to offset coal-fired electricity generated-based pollution. In the United States, if all Internet users enabled Privacy Badger on their computers, Americans would save more than $91 million annually. Globally, uBlock Origin could save consumers more than $1.8 billion/year. Open source ad blockers are a potentially effective technology for energy conservation.", "Internet of Things (IoT) systems deployments are becoming both ubiquitous and business critical in numerous business verticals, both for process automation and data-driven decision-making based on distributed sensors networks. Beneath the simplicity offered by these solutions, we usually find complex, multi-layer architectures-from hardware sensors up to data analytics systems. These rely heavily on software running on the on-location gateway devices designed to bridge the communication between the sensors and the cloud. This will generally require updates and improvements-raising deployment and maintenance challenges. Especially for large scale commercial solutions, a secure and fail-safe updating system becomes crucial for a successful IoT deployment. This paper explores the specific challenges for infrastructures dedicated to remote application deployment and management, addresses the management challenges related to IoT sensors systems, and proposes a mathematical model and a methodology for tackling this. To test the model's efficiency, we implemented it as a software infrastructure system for complete commercial IoT products. As proof, we present the deployment of 100 smart soda dispensing machines in three locations. Each machine relies on sensors monitoring its status and on gateways controlling its behaviour, each receiving 133 different remote software updates through our solution. In addition, 80% of the machines ran non-interrupted for 250 days, with 20% failing due to external factors; out of the 80%, 30% experienced temporary update failures due to reduced hardware capabilities and the system successfully performed automatic rollback of the system, thus recovering in 100% of the temporary failures.", "Building energy usage is growing at a rapid pace under increasing urbanisation tendencies in both the developing and the developed world, at high environmental and social costs. Decentralised control architectures for local energy grids are seen as a key solution to optimise energy management at the local level. As the infrastructure for data collection, communication and embedded computing becomes more capable, new online algorithms can be deployed for forecasting and anomaly detection of large consumers. Fine grained tendencies and unusual artefacts can be thus exploited to improve local and grid level energy management. Our two-fold approach first leverages the Matrix Profile technique for time series data mining to build a dataset of anomaly patterns from public building energy traces and extract analytics information. Subsequently the labeled dataset is used in a supervised learning classification model to discriminate between various related dominant usage patterns. The case study is carried out on a public dataset of academic buildings. The approach can prove useful for exploiting complementary energy consumption patterns in a decentralised control structure towards grid balancing and economic operation.", "Interaction design and tangible computing offer rich opportunities for supporting children with impairments by means of enhanced therapeutic toys and educational materials. In order to explore how technology can be utilized to meet special requirements in the education of visually impaired children (and teenagers), we set up a practice-based research project at a special health center and school for the blind. Drawing on a number of design experiments involving educators and affected children, we came up with design proposals that enabled instructive (sensory) experiences despite their impairments in the sensory system. We describe two interactive prototypes in detail - a tangible color-picker toy, that we named The Cuebe, and an Audio-Tactile Map designed for e-learning - and show how they can support children in building new skills by augmenting physical properties and affordances. In both prototypes, tactility, haptics, and interactivity were crucial features, since all experiences originated at the fingertips and then unfolded higher-level sensory and cognitive processes. Moreover, the prototypes were also characterized by a high degree of open-endedness and customizability in their design, allowing educators to incorporate them in flexible ways to meet the needs of the children.", "Bridge inspections are an important procedure for maintaining the infrastructure vital to our economy and well-being. The current methodology of utilizing specialized equipment such as snooper trucks and scaffolding to support manned-inspections poses a significant financial cost, disrupts traffic, and is dangerous to the inspectors and public. The advent of unmanned aerial systems (UAS), more commonly called drones, presents a practical solution that promises reduced cost, enhanced safety, and is significantly less intrusive than previous methodologies. Current limitations in the implementation of UAS include the reliance on a skilled operator and/or the requirement for a UAS to operate in a cluttered, GPS-denied environment. A solution to these challenges is presented in this paper by utilizing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware including laser rangefinders, optical flow sensors, and live video telemetry. Included in the system is the obstacle avoidance equipped drone and a ground station intended to be manned by a pilot and bridge inspector. The proposed custom-fabricated UAS was implemented during eight inspections of Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) bridges. The UAS was able to navigate under GPS-denied and obstacle-laden bridge decks with position-hold performance comparable to, if not better than, a COTS unit in an unobstructed environment. The position hold capability maintained an altitude of +/- 12.8 cm with a horizontal hold of +/- 435 cm. Details of the hardware, algorithm development, and suggestions for future research are discussed in this paper.", "Although opening up of research is considered an appropriate and trend-setting model for future scientific communication, it can still be difficult to put open science into practice. How open and transparent can a scientific work be? This article investigates the potential to make all information and the whole work process of a qualification project such as a doctoral thesis comprehensively and freely accessible on the internet with an open free license both in the final form and completely traceable in development. The answer to the initial question, the self-experiment and the associated demand for openness, posed several challenges for a doctoral student, the institution, and the examination regulations, which are still based on the publication of an individually written and completed work that cannot be viewed by the public during the creation process. In the case of data and other documents, publication is usually not planned even after completion. This state of affairs in the use of open science in the humanities will be compared with open science best practices in the physical sciences. The reasons and influencing factors for open developments in science and research are presented, empirically and experimentally tested in the development of the first completely open humanities-based PhD thesis. The results of this two-part study show that it is possible to publish everything related to the doctoral study, qualification, and research process as soon as possible, as comprehensively as possible, and under an open license.", "Deep learning models are computationally intense, and implementations often have to be highly optimized by experts or hardware vendors to be usable in practice. The DL compiler, together with Learning-to-Compile has proven to be a powerful technique for optimizing tensor programs. However, a limitation of this approach is that it still suffers from unbearably long overall optimization time. In this paper, we present a new method, called AdaTune, that significantly reduces the optimization time of tensor programs for high-performance deep learning inference. In particular, we propose an adaptive evaluation method that statistically early terminates a costly hardware measurement without losing much accuracy. We further devise a surrogate model with uncertainty quantification that allows the optimization to adapt to hardware and model heterogeneity better. Finally, we introduce a contextual optimizer that provides adaptive control of the exploration and exploitation to improve the transformation space searching effectiveness. We evaluate and compare the levels of optimization obtained by AutoTVM, a stateof-the-art Learning-to-Compile technique on top of TVM, and AdaTune. The experiment results show that AdaTune obtains up to 115% higher GFLOPS than the baseline under the same optimization time budget. Furthermore, AdaTune provides 1.3-3.9x speedup in optimization time over the baseline to reach the same optimization quality for a range of models across different hardware architectures.", "This article develops and implements a vision-based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-to-UAV pursuit system using a commercial off-the-shelf Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 quadrotor. This technology is intended as a countermeasure to rogue drones carrying out activities such as flying in restricted airspace, performing unauthorized aerial videography, transporting contraband and other criminal activities, or being used as improvised weapons. The proposed approach offers benefits over other current solutions, such as wide-area radio-frequency jamming that interferes with regular communication devices or high-energy military laser systems that are expensive and time consuming to set up. A linear dynamics model of the AR.Drone 2.0 vehicle stabilized by its onboard feedback control system is derived, and its parameters are experimentally identified. A linear model predictive control is developed to track specified flight trajectories, then implemented and validated in hardware flight tests. Detection and ranging of the target UAV from the pursuer UAV's onboard monocular camera are performed using the YOLO v2 convolutional neural network algorithm. The combined control and vision design is implemented in hardware and tested quantitatively in flight experiments.", ["Purpose", "COVID-19 hits every country's health-care system and economy. There is a trend toward using automation technology in response to the COVID-19 crisis not only in developed countries but also in those with lower levels of technology development. However, current studies mainly focus on the world level, and only a few ones report deployments at the country level. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the use of automation solutions in Vietnam with locally available materials mainly in the first wave from January to July 2020.", "Design/methodology/approach", "The authors collected COVID-related automation solutions during the first wave of COVID-19 in Vietnam from January to July 2020 through a search process. The analysis and insights of a panel consisting of various disciplines (i.e. academia, health care, government, entrepreneur and media) aim at providing a clear picture of how and to what extent these solutions have been deployed.", "Findings", "The authors found seven groups of solutions from low to high research and development (R&D) levels deployed across the country with various funding sources. Low R&D solutions were widely spread owing to simplicity and affordability. High R&D solutions were mainly deployed in big cities. Most of the solutions were deployed during the first phases when international supply chains were limited with a significant contribution of the media. Higher R&D solutions have opportunities to be deployed in the reopening phase. However, challenges can be listed as limited interdisciplinary research teams, market demand, the local supporting industry, end-user validation and social-ethical issues.", "Originality/value", "To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first study analyzing the use of automation technology in response to COVID-19 in Vietnam and also in a country in Southeast Asia. Lessons learned from these current deployments are useful for future emerging infectious diseases. The reality of Vietnam's automation solutions in response to COVID-19 might be a reference for other developing countries with similar social-economic circumstances and contributes to the global picture of how different countries adopt technology to combat COVID-19."], "Three years ago, the autonomous citizen science project Meet je Stad (Measure your City) formed a community in Amersfoort that developed its own instruments to measure climatic change locally. Like many citizen science projects, this initiative faces challenges to being considered a legitimate and credible way of extending climate research, or as a source of robust information for local climate risk governance. In this article, we will provide a social history of this project, of its activities, motivations and forms of organizations. We will focus on their practices, their connection to academic science, and their guiding narratives of change. These narratives are concerned with both changes to the climate and social changes to what is considered a legitimate way of scientifically studying the climate. In this article we argue that autonomous citizen science avoids some of the pitfalls that caused the legitimation crisis of climate science and is a useful expansion of risk governance in the context of societal change.", "Low-power processors for the Internet-of-Things (IoT) demand a high degree of adaptability to efficiently execute applications with different resource requirements under varying scenarios. Current single-ISA heterogeneous Chip Multiprocessors (CMPs), such as ARM's big.LITTLE, provide multiple cores and voltage/frequency levels to address this challenge. However, finding the best possible type of core and the corresponding voltage/frequency level for all the execution scenarios, which involve different applications and phases, remains far from being reached. In this article, we propose extending such a single-ISA heterogeneous CMP with a Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Array (CGRA) and a hardware-based dynamic binary translation (DBT) module that transparently maps application code onto the CGRA for acceleration. To achieve low-energy levels and efficiently manage the power consumption of the CGRA, we introduce an additional voltage rail that enables operation in the Near-Threshold Voltage (NTV) regime when needed, leveraging key features of the CGRA's structure to address the implementation challenges of NTV computing. For less than 35 percent area overhead to the baseline CMP, performance and energy consumption are improved as follows. Compared to: (a) power-efficient execution in the LITTLE core, MuTARe achieves 29 percent reduction in energy consumption, and 2x speedup; (b) performance-efficient execution in the big core, a speedup of 1.6x with an energy reduction of 41 percent is achieved.", null, "Pushed by the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm modern sensor networks monitor a wide range of phenomena, in areas such as environmental monitoring, health care, industrial processes, and smart cities. These networks provide a continuous pulse of the almost infinite activities that are happening in the physical space and are thus, key enablers for a Digital Earth Nervous System. Nevertheless, the rapid processing of these sensor data streams still continues to challenge traditional data-handling solutions and new approaches are being requested. We propose a generic answer to this challenge, which has the potential to support any form of distributed real-time analysis. This neutral methodology follows a brokering approach to work with different kinds of data sources and uses web-based standards to achieve interoperability. As a proof of concept, we implemented the methodology to detect anomalies in real-time and applied it to the area of environmental monitoring. The developed system is capable of detecting anomalies, generating notifications, and displaying the recent situation to the user.", "The Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Cloud technologies today provide new options for remote measurement data collection, storage and processing. Fuel tank calibration process automation by adapting IoT infrastructure model is explored in the article. The impact of geometric and volumetric fuel tank calibration methods upon hardware and communication channels requirements in IoT infrastructure are considered in the paper. A distributed certified metrological laboratory establishment in the field of fuel tank calibration concept is introduced and explained by system architecture view description and sequence diagram of its operation.", "This article contends that technopopulism is a discursive formation that emerges from the convergence of two preexisting discourses: populism and technolibertarianism. Whereas these discourses are historically distinct the 2008 financial crisis and the 2011 wave of struggles precipitated the political conditions for their intersection. Such convergence produces both tensions and possibilities. On the one hand, technopopulism engenders a radically participatory model of democracy, which is ultimately anti-institutional as citizens cooperate and engage in sophisticated decision-making without the mediation of professional politicians. On the other hand, the more electorally successful technopopulist parties are led by charismatic leaders who synthesize the positions that emerge from the netroots to mobilize them against the establishment. These two seemingly contradictory aspects precipitate in two variants of technopopulism: a leaderless-technocratic variant, which is derived from the open source mode of governance and from early experiments of the Global Justice Movement in networked self-government; and a leaderist-populist variant, which is more strictly focused on the electoral competition as an intrinsically hegemonic practice. The article concludes with a reflection on the discursive complementarity of these two variants.", "Often considered as the brain of an industrial process, Industrial control systems are presented as the vital part of today's critical infrastructure due to their crucial role in process control and monitoring. Any failure or error in the system will have a considerable damage. Their openness to the internet world raises the risk related to cyber-attacks. Therefore, it's necessary to consider cyber security challenges while designing an ICS in order to provide security services such as authentication, integrity, access control and secure communication channels. To implement such services, it's necessary to provide an efficient key management system (KMS) as an infrastructure for all cryptographic operations, while preserving the functional characteristics of ICS. In this paper we will analyze existing KMS and their suitability for ICS, then we propose a new KMS based on Identity Based Cryptography (IBC) as a better alternative to traditional KMS. In our proposal, we consider solving two security problems in IBC which brings it up to be more suitable for ICS.", "Advances in biological engineering are likely to have substantial impacts on global society. To explore these potential impacts we ran a horizon scanning exercise to capture a range of perspectives on the opportunities and risks presented by biological engineering. We first identified 70 potential issues, and then used an iterative process to prioritise 20 issues that we considered to be emerging, to have potential global impact, and to be relatively unknown outside the field of biological engineering. The issues identified may be of interest to researchers, businesses and policy makers in sectors such as health, energy, agriculture and the environment.", "For gaining proficiency in physical human-robot interactions, it is crucial for engineering students to be provided with the opportunity to gain hands-on experience with robotic devices that feature kinesthetic feedback. In this article, we propose HandsOn-SEA, a low-cost, single degree-of-freedom, force-controlled educational robot with series elastic actuation and introduce educational modules for the use of the device to allow students to experience the fundamental performance trade-offs inherent in robotic systems. The novelty of the proposed robot is due to the deliberate introduction of a compliant element between the actuator and the handle, whose deflections are measured to perform closed-loop force control. As an admittance-type robot, HandsOn-SEA relies on force feedback to achieve the desired level of safety and transparency and complements the existing impedance-type educational robots. We present the integration of HandsOn-SEA into the robotics curriculum, by providing guidelines for its use in a senior level robotics course, to help students experience the challenges involved in the synergistic design and control of robotic devices. We systematically evaluate the efficacy of the device in a robotics course delivered for five semesters and provide evidence that HandsOn-SEA is effective in instilling fundamental concepts and trade-offs in the design and control of robotic devices.", "This research aims to develop an automatic unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based indoor environmental monitoring system for the acquisition of data at a very fine scale to detect rapid changes in environmental features of plants growing in greenhouses. Due to the complexity of the proposed research, in this paper we proposed an off-board distributed control system based on visual input for a micro aerial vehicle (MAV) able to hover, navigate, and fly to a desired target location without considerably affecting the effective flight time. Based on the experimental results, the MAV was able to land on the desired location within a radius of about 10 cm from the center point of the landing pad, with a reduction in the effective flight time of about 28%.", "Monitoring the size of key indicator species of fish is important to understand ecosystem functions, anthropogenic stress, and population dynamics. Standard methodologies gather data using underwater cameras, but are biased due to the use of baits, limited deployment time, and short field of view. Furthermore, they require experts to analyse long videos to search for species of interest, which is time consuming and expensive. This paper describes the Underwater Detector of Moving Object Size (UDMOS), a cost-effective computer vision system that records events of large fishes passing in front of a camera, using minimalistic hardware and power consumption. UDMOS can be deployed underwater, as an unbaited system, and is also offered as a free-to-use Web Service for batch video-processing. It embeds three different alternative large-object detection algorithms based on deep learning, unsupervised modelling, and motion detection, and can work both in shallow and deep waters with infrared or visible light.", "As the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic begins, it remains clear that a massive increase in the ability to test for SARS-CoV-2 infections in a myriad of settings is critical to controlling the pandemic and to preparing for future outbreaks. The current gold standard for molecular diagnostics is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), but the extraordinary and unmet demand for testing in a variety of environments means that both complementary and supplementary testing solutions are still needed. This review highlights the role that loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has had in filling this global testing need, providing a faster and easier means of testing, and what it can do for future applications, pathogens, and the preparation for future outbreaks. This review describes the current state of the art for research of LAMP-based SARS-CoV-2 testing, as well as its implications for other pathogens and testing. The authors represent the global LAMP (gLAMP) Consortium, an international research collective, which has regularly met to share their experiences on LAMP deployment and best practices; sections are devoted to all aspects of LAMP testing, including preanalytic sample processing, target amplification, and amplicon detection, then the hardware and software required for deployment are discussed, and finally, a summary of the current regulatory landscape is provided. Included as well are a series of first-person accounts of LAMP method development and deployment. The final discussion section provides the reader with a distillation of the most validated testing methods and their paths to implementation. This review also aims to provide practical information and insight for a range of audiences: for a research audience, to help accelerate research through sharing of best practices; for an implementation audience, to help get testing up and running quickly; and for a public health, clinical, and policy audience, to help convey the breadth of the effect that LAMP methods have to offer.", "The implementation of integrated analytical techniques to meet stringent requirements in the life sciences requires a well-developed analytical capacity. New technology in analytical equipment for the analysis of large and small molecules is continuously being developed. However, developing countries frequently struggle to keep pace with technological advancements. Hence, it is of utmost importance to better invest in optimizing existing and proven methodologies to tackle life-saving challenges in developing countries. In this regard, capillary electrophoresis is a promising candidate for solving multiple analytical problems compared to its chromatographic and spectroscopic counterparts due to its fast analytical response time and notable cost efficiency. In the following, we summarize various issues and opportunities for capillary electrophoresis to be the technique of choice for the unresolved bottlenecks in analytical equipment in developing countries for drug quality control. This perspective demonstrates that the ongoing quest for the design of new, impactful analytical techniques is a dynamic and rapidly developing research area and mentions some directions and opportunities that have arisen during the recent pandemic.", "The solubility of proteins correlates with a variety of their properties, including function, production yield, pharmacokinetics, and formulation at high concentrations. High solubility is therefore a key requirement for the development of protein-based reagents for applications in life sciences, biotechnology, diagnostics, and therapeutics. Accurate solubility measurements, however, remain challenging and resource intensive, which limits their throughput and hence their applicability at the early stages of development pipelines, when long-lists of candidates are typically available in minute amounts. Here, we present an automated method based on the titration of a crowding agent (polyethylene glycol, PEG) to quantitatively assess relative solubility of proteins using about 200 mu g of purified material. Our results demonstrate that this method is accurate and economical in material requirement and costs of reagents, which makes it suitable for high-throughput screening. This approach is freely-shared and based on a low cost, open-source liquid-handling robot. We anticipate that this method will facilitate the assessment of the developability of proteins and make it substantially more accessible.", "Modern experimental research often relies on the synchronization of different events prior to data analysis. One way of achieving synchronization involves marking distinct events with electrical pulses (event markers or \"TTL pulses\"), which are continuously recorded with research hardware, and can later be temporally aligned. Traditionally, this event marking was often performed using the parallel port in standard personal computers. However, the parallel port is disappearing from the landscape of computer hardware, being replaced by a serial (COM) port, namely the USB port. To find an adequate replacement for the parallel port, we evaluated four microcontroller units (MCUs) and the LabJack U3, an often-used USB data acquisition device, in terms of their latency and jitter for sending event markers in a simulated experiment on both Windows and Linux. Our results show that all four MCUs were comparable to the parallel port in terms of both latency and jitter, and consistently achieved latencies under 1 ms. With some caveats, the LabJack U3 can also achieve comparable latencies. In addition to the collected data, we share extensive documentation on how to build and use MCUs for event marking, including code examples. MCUs are a cost-effective, flexible, and performant replacement for the disappearing parallel port, enabling event marking and synchronization of data streams.", "During the COVID-19 pandemic, all the courses are implemented using the online learning method. This study aims to report the implementation of active distance learning during the pandemic era in Indonesia. The main challenge in this implementation is seeking the trade-off between the achievement of student outcomes and the existing resources. Three active learning approaches are already implemented, i.e. smartphone-based measurement; circuit simulation; and course project. The implementation of these active learnings has considered the students' existing resources, like smartphones, computers, and microcontrollers. These active learning approaches are a complement to lecture-based learning. It can be used to improve the students' competencies. Furthermore, students are more active and take more initiative, particularly during course project implementation. This study has shown that the active learning approach still can be implemented during home-based learning while retaining the student outcomes achievement.", "The purpose of this study was to determine IT teacher candidates' attitudes, self-efficacy and opinions about educational robotic-based programming education. The participants of this study consisted of 2nd class students in Computer Education and Instructional Technologies department of a university in Turkey. The study group of the research consisted of undergraduate students who takes C programming course, and who also undertook traditional teaching as well as weekly Arduino applications that matched with weekly topics. Programming attitude and self-efficacy perception scales were used to specify students' attitude towards the course and self-efficacy perception. In addition to quantitative data, to explain the entire process from students' perspectives, a semi-structured interview form developed by the researchers was applied. The study findings showed that using micro-controllers such as Arduino for laboratory applications in programming education was of a positive effect on students' attitudes, which was also supported by interview findings. Accordingly, almost all of the students described this application as engaging, interesting, exciting, and intriguing. The changes in students' self-efficacy perception towards programming were also investigated and the findings demonstrated that there was no statistically significant difference, which was proven by the quantitative data obtained from the interviews. In this sense, although students perceived programming education with Arduino as positive, they were careful about this education model in terms of programming knowledge and skill development.", "Recently, patient safety and healthcare have gained high attention in professional and health policy-makers. This rapid growth causes generating a high amount of data, which is known as big data. Therefore, handling and processing of this data are attracted great attention. Cloud computing is one of the main choices for handling and processing of this type of data. But, as far as we know, the detailed review and deep discussion in this filed are very rare. Therefore, this paper reviews and discusses the recently introduced mechanisms in this field as well as providing a deep analysis of their applied mechanisms. Moreover, the drawbacks and benefits of the reviewed mechanisms have been discussed and the main challenges of these mechanisms are highlighted for developing more efficient healthcare big data processing techniques over cloud computing in the future.", "Autonomous Wireless Sensors (AWSs) are at the core of every Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). Current AWS technology allows the development of many IoT-based applications, ranging from military to bioengineering and from industry to education. The energy optimization of AWSs depends mainly on: Structural, functional, and application specifications. The holistic design methodology addresses all the factors mentioned above. In this sense, we propose an original solution based on a novel architecture that duplicates the transceivers and also the power source using a hybrid storage system. By identifying the consumption needs of the transceivers, an appropriate methodology for sizing and controlling the power flow for the power source is proposed. The paper emphasizes the fusion between information, communication, and energy consumption of the AWS in terms of spectrum information through a set of transceiver testing scenarios, identifying the main factors that influence the sensor node design and their inter-dependencies. Optimization of the system considers all these factors obtaining an energy efficient AWS, paving the way towards autonomous sensors by adding an energy harvesting element to them.", "Heavy industrial machinery is a primary asset for the operation of key sectors such as construction, manufacturing, and logistics. Targeted attacks against these assets could result in incidents, fatal injuries, and substantial financial loss. Given the importance of such scenarios, we analyzed and evaluated the security implications of the technology used to operate and control this machinery, namely industrial radio remote controllers. We conducted the first-ever security analysis of this technology, which relies on proprietary radio-frequency protocols to implement remote-control functionalities. Through a two-phase evaluation approach we discovered important flaws in the design and implementation of industrial remote controllers. In this paper we introduce and describe 5 practical attacks affecting major vendors and multiple real-world installations.

The autonomous road sign contains many types of sensors, of which the subject of interest in this article is the Doppler sensor that we have improved and the constructed and calibrated acoustic probe. An algorithm for performing vehicle detection and tracking, as well as vehicle speed measurement, in a signal acquired with a continuous wave Doppler sensor, is discussed. A method is also experimentally presented and studied for counting vehicles and for determining their movement direction by means of acoustic vector sensor application. The assumptions of the method employing spatial distribution of sound intensity determined with the help of an integrated three-dimensional (3D) sound intensity probe are discussed. The enhanced Doppler radar and the developed sound intensity probe were used for the experiments that are described and analyzed in the paper.", "Nano-sized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), e.g. quadcopters, have received significant attention in recent years. Although their capabilities have grown, they continue to have very limited flight times, tens of minutes at most. The main constraints are the battery's energy density and the engine power required for flight. In this work, we present a nano-sized blimp platform, consisting of a helium balloon and a rotorcraft. Thanks to the lift provided by helium, the blimp requires relatively little energy to remain at a stable altitude. This lift, however, decreases with time as the balloon inevitably deflates requiring additional control mechanisms to keep the desired altitude. We study how duty-cycling high power actuators can further reduce the average energy requirements for hovering. With the addition of a solar panel, it is even feasible to sustain tens or hundreds of flight hours in modest lighting conditions. Furthermore, we study how a balloon's deflation rate affects the blimp's energy budget and lifetime. A functioning 68-gram prototype was thoroughly characterized and its lifetime was measured under different harvesting conditions and different power management strategies. Both our system model and the experimental results indicate our proposed platform requires less than 200 mW to hover indefinitely with an ideal balloon. With a non-ideal balloon the maximum lifetime of approximate to 400 h is bounded by the rotor's maximum thrust. This represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first nano-size UAV for long term hovering with low power requirements.", "Asemantic map, which can provide important data to facilitate a drone's understanding to the environment, is critical for a fully autonomous drone. However, recent methods for producing such a map implemented on small drones that use low-/middle-grade processors and graphics processing units can hardly achieve real-time performance. In addition, few existing methods can reconstruct semantic planes based on a sparse depth map, which can greatly reduce computational load while encountering challenges in semantic reconstruction. To address this problem, this paper presents a novel on-board approach, called sparse fusion, which demonstrates real-time reconstruction of a semantic plane on a self-designed small drone. The approach combines the sparse depth map derived from a visual-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping with the semantic labels derived from a convolutional neural network for each frame using sparse fusion. Our proposed local plane optimization function greatly improves the accuracy of the semantic plane. Experimental results on various scenarios demonstrate that our sparse fusion module running on the drone platform can update the semantic plane within 1 ms, which is faster and achieves greater accuracy than the state-of-the-art real-time semantic reconstruction method. We also conducted experiments in real environments to demonstrate the performance of our method.", "This article has two outreach aims. It concisely summarizes the main research and technical efforts in the EC H2020 ARIES Integrating Activity-Accelerator Research and Innovation for European Science and Society [1] during the period 2017/2018. ARIES is a continuation of CARE, TIARA and EuCARD projects [2-3]. The article also tries to show these results as an encouragement for local physics and engineering, research and technical communities to participate actively in such important European projects. According to the author's opinion this participation may be much bigger [4-27]. All the needed components to participate-human, material and infrastructural are there [4,7]. So why the results are not satisfying as they should be? The major research subjects of ARIES are: new methods of particles acceleration including laser, plasma and particle beam interactions, new materials and accelerator components, building new generations of accelerators, energy efficiency and management of large accelerator systems, innovative superconducting magnets, high field and ultra-high gradient magnets, cost lowering, system miniaturization, promotion of innovation originating from accelerator research, industrial applications, and societal implications. Two institutions from Poland participate in ARIES-these are Warsaw University of Technology and Institute of Nuclear Chemistry and Technology in Warsaw. There are not present some of the key institutes active in accelerator technology in Poland. Let this article be a small contribution why Poland, a country of such big research potential, contributes so modestly to the European accelerator infrastructural projects? The article bases on public and internal documents of ARIES project, including the EU Grant Agreement and P1 report. The views presented in the paper are only by the author and not necessarily by the ARIES.", "Smart Cities are complex distributed systems which may involve multiple stakeholders, applications, sensors, and IoT devices. In order to be able to link and use such heterogeneous data, spatial data infrastructures for Smart Cities can play an important role in establishing interoperability between systems and platforms. Based on the open and international standards of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), the Smart District Data Infrastructure (SDDI) concept integrates different sensors, IoT devices, simulation tools, and 3D city models within a common operational framework. However, such distributed systems, if not secured, may cause a major threat by disclosing sensitive information to untrusted or unauthorized entities. Also, there are various users and applications who prefer to work with all the systems in convenient ways using Single-Sign-On. This paper presents a concept for securing distributed applications and services in such data infrastructures for Smart Cities. The concept facilitates privacy, security and controlled access to all stakeholders and the respective components by establishing proper authorization and authentication mechanisms. The approach facilitates Single-Sign On (SSO) authentication by a novel combination in the use of the state-of-the-art security concepts such as OAuth2 access tokens, OpenID Connect user claims and Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML). An implementation of this concept for the district Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London is shown in this paper and is also provided as an online demonstration. Such access control and security federation based realization has not been considered in spatial data infrastructures for Smart Cities before. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.", "In order to allow Micro Areal Vehicles (MAVs) to autonomously explore urban areas a precise knowledge of the MAV's kinematic state is essential. Thus, an integrated navigation system is presented in this paper. It provides a precise self-localization in both; indoor and outdoor areas. In order to circumvent the disadvantages of common image or laser based navigation systems, the information from both sensors are fused together on an early stage. That means, laser rangefinder's distance measurements are referred to image pixels. This results in 2.5-D images. But in order to do so, the pose between both sensors has to be known. Therefore a process that allows a calibration of the sensors' extrinsic parameters is presented in this paper. Our navigation filter bases on a reduced SLAM approach combined with relative motion measurements. Both elements benefit from the 2.5-D images. The scale factor of the relative translational motion can be simply measured, while the landmarks can be initialized instantaneously with precisely known depth. This results in a navigation system that provides precise and long-term stable navigation solutions, independently from structure and condition of the environment.", "In this study, a miniature artificial compound eye (15 mm in diameter) called the curved artificial compound eye (CurvACE) was endowed for the first time with hyperacuity, using similar micro-movements to those occurring in the fly's compound eye. A periodic micro-scanning movement of only a few degrees enables the vibrating compound eye to locate contrasting objects with a 40-fold greater resolution than that imposed by the interommatidial angle. In this study, we developed a new algorithm merging the output of 35 local processing units consisting of adjacent pairs of artificial ommatidia. The local measurements performed by each pair are processed in parallel with very few computational resources, which makes it possible to reach a high refresh rate of 500 Hz. An aerial robotic platform with two degrees of freedom equipped with the active CurvACE placed over naturally textured panels was able to assess its linear position accurately with respect to the environment thanks to its efficient gaze stabilization system. The algorithm was found to perform robustly at different light conditions as well as distance variations relative to the ground and featured small closed-loop positioning errors of the robot in the range of 45 mm. In addition, three tasks of interest were performed without having to change the algorithm: short-range odometry, visual stabilization, and tracking contrasting objects (hands) moving over a textured background.", "This position paper critically analyses the process to implement the UNESCO Recommendation on the Historic Urban Landscape (2011), exploring evaluation tools, innovative business/management models and financing tools for the conservation and regeneration of Historic Urban Landscape (HUL), to make it operational in the perspective of a circular economy model of sustainable development for city/territory system regeneration. Through evaluation tools, it is possible to pass from general principles to operational practices; to produce empirical evidence of the economic, social and environmental benefits of HUL integrated conservation and regeneration. The challenge of generating a symbiosis between conservation and transformation issues requires adequate evaluation methods, business, management and financing tools, engaging civil society and local stakeholders, capturing both HUL tangible and intangible values to turn the historic urban landscape into a driver of sustainable growth. The analysis carried out in this paper shows that through the suggested tools it is possible to make operational the UNESCO Recommendations, transforming conflicts into opportunities, producing economic attractiveness and strengthen social awareness and cohesion.", "South Africa could potentially face a shortage of water in the near future. Efficient and low cost methods to determine water usage are vital to help prevent this issue. Flow and usage meters are necessary to ensure accurate usage readings. An electromagnetic flow meter and a water usage meter were developed. The designed module can be implemented on a standard water pipe at residential areas. The developed system harvests energy using a solar panel.", "Full battery electric vehicles are yet to achieve significant worldwide success on the market. This analysis shows that the required technologies have already been developed, but not for a use in the mass market, where low cost is mandatory to be successful. Central roles for this success will be played by governments, industries, and research and standardization institutions. A great effort in both national and international synchronization and coordination activities, together with a clear regulatory push, will be mandatory. Enabling technologies for the plug-in hybrid and full electric vehicles will also come from the \"3Cs\": Costs, Comfort, and Climatic dependency. There is definitely not a single impulse that will be sufficient to enable the market for electric vehicles.", "This paper describes an experience, held with a class of primary school children, aimed to introduce a novel educational topic, the smart materials, and the interfaces built with them (Smart Material Interfaces). The pupils were guided along a multidisciplinary path in which traditional and innovative teaching methods were composed for educating while engaging the children. It led to the creation of 6 automated puppet plays focused on the themes of environmental awareness as a result. In this process, storytelling and visual programming acted as powerful means for merging different educational concepts and techniques. The data collected through the direct observation and the questionnaires indicate that the experience was perceived as positive and interesting. The post evaluation, held some months later, revealed skills and knowledge improvements in all the areas involved by the multidisciplinary experience. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Global Navigation Satellite System/Inertial Navigation System (GNSS/INS) is one of the significant components of any vehicle navigation system. However, GNSS has limitations in some operating scenarios such as urban regions and indoor environments where the GNSS signal suffers from multipath or outage. On the other hand, INS standalone navigation solution degrades over time due to the INS errors. Therefore, a modern vehicle navigation system depends on integration between different sensors to aid INS for mitigating its drift during GNSS signal outage. However, there are some challenges for the aiding sensors related to their high price, high computational costs, and environmental and weather effects. This paper proposes an integrated aiding navigation system for vehicles in an indoor environment (e.g., underground parking). This proposed system is based on optical flow and multiple mass flow sensors integrations to aid the low-cost INS by providing the navigation extended Kalman filter (EKF) with forward velocity and change of heading updates to enhance the vehicle navigation. The optical flow is computed for frames taken using a consumer portable device (CPD) camera mounted in the upward-looking direction to avoid moving objects in front of the camera and to exploit the typical features of the underground parking or tunnels such as ducts and pipes. On the other hand, the multiple mass flow sensors measurements are modeled to provide forward velocity information. Moreover, a mass flow differential odometry is proposed where the vehicle change of heading is estimated from the multiple mass flow sensors measurements. This integrated aiding system can be used for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and land vehicle navigations. However, the experimental results are implemented for land vehicles through the integration of CPD with mass flow sensors to aid the navigation system.", "Policy makers in regions such as Europe are increasingly concerned about the trustworthiness and sovereignty of the foundations of their digital economy, because it often depends on systems operated or manufactured elsewhere. To help curb this problem, we propose the novel notion of a responsible Internet, which provides higher degrees of trust and sovereignty for critical service providers (e.g., power grids) and all kinds of other users by improving the transparency, accountability, and controllability of the Internet at the network-level. A responsible Internet accomplishes this through two new distributed and decentralized systems. The first is the Network Inspection Plane (NIP), which enables users to request measurement-based descriptions of the chains of network operators (e.g., ISPs and DNS and cloud providers) that handle their data flows or could potentially handle them, including the relationships between them and the properties of these operators. The second is the Network Control Plane (NCP), which allows users to specify how they expect the Internet infrastructure to handle their data (e.g., in terms of the security attributes that they expect chains of network operators to have) based on the insights they gained from the NIP. We discuss research directions and starting points to realize a responsible Internet by combining three currently largely disjoint research areas: large-scale measurements (for the NIP), open source-based programmable networks (for the NCP), and policy making (POL) based on the NIP and driving the NCP. We believe that a responsible Internet is the next stage in the evolution of the Internet and that the concept is useful for clean slate Internet systems as well.", "We present a low-cost (approximate to$150) monitoring system for collecting high temporal resolution residential water use data without disrupting the operation of commonly available water meters. This system was designed for installation on top of analog, magnetically driven, positive displacement, residential water meters and can collect data at a variable time resolution interval. The system couples an Arduino Pro microcontroller board, a datalogging shield customized for this specific application, and a magnetometer sensor. The system was developed and calibrated at the Utah Water Research Laboratory and was deployed for testing on five single family residences in Logan and Providence, Utah, for a period of over 1 month. Battery life for the device was estimated to be over 5 weeks with continuous data collection at a 4 s time interval. Data collected using this system, under ideal installation conditions, was within 2% of the volume recorded by the register of the meter on which they were installed. Results from field deployments are presented to demonstrate the accuracy, functionality, and applicability of the system. Results indicate that the device is capable of collecting data at a temporal resolution sufficient for identifying individual water use events and analyzing water use at coarser temporal resolutions. This system is of special interest for water end use studies, future projections of residential water use, water infrastructure design, and for advancing our understanding of water use timing and behavior. The system's hardware design and software are open source, are available for potential reuse, and can be customized for specific research needs.", "BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to large-scale shutdowns in society. This resulted in global supply bottlenecks for medical protective equipment. The so-called Maker Movement recognized this emerging problem early on and, with the help of additive manufacturing (AM), began developing and manufacturing half masks or face shields as personal protective equipment (PPE). This knowledge has been made available in many places in form of open source product data, so that products could be adapted and improved, saving development time.MethodsThis production and innovation potential has been taken up and professionalized by the authors of this article. By means of a proof-of-principle we provide an overview of the possibility and successful unique introduction of a so-called professional \"hybrid production\" in a micro factory using 3D-printing at the place of greatest demand in a hospital by medical personnel to produce their own PPE. Furthermore the learning process and future benefits of on site 3D-printing are described.ResultsOur proof-of-principle successfully showed that the allocation of 3D-printing capabilities in the hospital infrastructure is possible. With assistance of the engineers, responsible for product design and development, the medical staff was able to produce PPE by means of AM. However, due to legal uncertainties and high material and production costs the usability is severely limited.ConclusionsThe practical research showed that a complete implementation of the concept and the short-term establishment of a 3D-printing factory for the autonomous supply of a hospital with PPE was not feasible without further efforts. Nevertheless, it has enabled the medical staff to use AM technologies for future research approaches.", "Low Complexity Enhancement Video Coding (LCEVC) is a new MPEG video codec, currently undergoing standardization as MPEG-5 Part 2. Rather than being another video codec, LCEVC enhances any other codec (e.g. AVC, VP9, HEVC, AV1, EVC or VVC) to produce a reduced computational load and a compression efficiency higher than what is achievable by the enhanced codec used alone for a given resolution, especially at video delivery relevant bitrates. The core idea is to use a conventional video codec as a base codec at a lower resolution and reconstruct a full resolution video by combining the decoded low-resolution video with up to two enhancement sub-layers of residuals encoded with specialized lowcomplexity coding tools.", "Understanding how cells self-organize into functional higher-order structures is of great interest, both towards deciphering animal development and for our ability to predictably build custom tissues to meet research and therapeutic needs. The proper organization of cells across length scales results from interconnected and dynamic networks of molecules and cells. Optogenetic probes provide dynamic and tunable control over molecular events within cells, and thus represent a powerful approach to both dissect and control collective cell behaviors. Here, we emphasize the breadth of the optogenetic tool kit and discuss how these methods have already been used to reverse engineer the design rules of developing organisms. We also offer our perspective on the rich potential for optogenetics to power forward-engineering of tissue assembly towards the generation of bespoke tissues with user-defined properties.", "STEAM Education is nowadays a key element for our current digital society. Integrating STEAM and developing competences such as Computational Thinking is highly demanded by the industry and higher education institutions. In order to do so new methodological approaches are required. RoboSTEAM project is an Erasmus+ project defined to address these topics by using of physical devices and robotics employing Challenge Based Learning methodology. One of the first steps in the project development is the definition of current landscape in the research field. Which means to carry out a literature mapping that considers previous applications of Challenge Based Learning in STEAM education and use of robots and physical devices to do so. This paper shows the mapping review process and the main results obtained. The mapping analyze 242 candidate works from the most relevant bibliographic sources and selected 54. Form them it was possible to see that there are not many initiatives on STEM Education related to Challenge base learning and the most of them are specially focused on the application of specific tools and in the development of concrete competences.", "To safely protect workplaces and the workforce during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, a scalable integrated sensing solution is required in order to offer real-time situational awareness and early warnings for decision-makers. However, an information-based solution for industry reopening is ineffective when the necessary operational information is locked up in disparate real-time data silos. There is a lot of ongoing effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic using different combinations of low-cost, location-based contact tracing, and sensing technologies. These ad hoc Internet of Things (IoT) solutions for COVID-19 were developed using different data models and protocols without an interoperable way to interconnect these heterogeneous systems and exchange data on people and place interactions. This research aims to design and develop an interoperable Internet of COVID-19 Things (IoCT) architecture that is able to exchange, aggregate, and reuse disparate IoT sensor data sources in order for informed decisions to be made after understanding the real-time risks in workplaces based on person-to-place interactions. The IoCT architecture is based on the Sensor Web paradigm that connects various Things, Sensors, and Datastreams with an indoor geospatial data model. This paper presents a study of what, to the best of our knowledge, is the first real-world integrated implementation of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) and IndoorGML standards to calculate the risk of COVID-19 online using a workplace reopening case study. The proposed IoCT offers a new open standard-based information model, architecture, methodologies, and software tools that enable the interoperability of disparate COVID-19 monitoring systems with finer spatial-temporal granularity. A workplace cleaning use case was developed in order to demonstrate the capabilities of this proposed IoCT architecture. The implemented IoCT architecture included proximity-based contact tracing, people density sensors, a COVID-19 risky behavior monitoring system, and the contextual building geospatial data.", "The limitation of battery capacity is a cause of range anxiety that reduces the wide use of electric bicycles (e-bikes). Therefore, many works have developed systems that provide assistance to cyclists to deal with the range anxiety problem. However, these systems may have limited applications since they can only work with the e-bike manufacturers' hardware and communication protocols. This paper proposes an energy monitoring system (EMS) for e-bikes, which is based on EnergyBus, a standardized hardware and communication protocol for e-bikes. EnergyBus standard is based on controller area network (CAN) bus and CANopen protocols. EMS comprises a gateway connected to EnergyBus of e-bike and an EMS application installed on a smart device that connects to the gateway via Bluetooth. The gateway provides CAN bus monitoring and CANopen device data access services to the smart device. These services are modeled to determine gateway parameters to ensure the efficient performance of the gateway and to keep the working status of the monitored e-bike safe. The EMS application provides the cyclist information about battery status, rider efforts, and other related information such as distance and speed. Experimental results show that the proposed gateway can monitor data in real-time and ensure monitored system safety.", null, ["Network interface cards (NICs) are fundamental components of modern high-speed networked systems, supporting multi-100 Gbps speeds and increasing programmability. Offloading computation from a server's CPU to a NIC frees a substantial amount of the server's CPU resources, making NICs key to offer competitive cloud services. Therefore, understanding the performance benefits and limitations of offloading a networking application to a NIC is of paramount importance.", "In this paper, we measure the performance of four different NICs from one of the largest NIC vendors worldwide, supporting 100 Gbps and 200 Gbps. We show that while today's NICs can easily support multi-hundred-gigabit throughputs, performing frequent update operations of a NIC's packet classifier-as network address translators (NATs) and load balancers would do for each incoming connection-results in a dramatic throughput reduction of up to 70 Gbps or complete denial of service. Our conclusion is that all tested NICs cannot support high-speed networking applications that require keeping track of a large number of frequently arriving incoming connections. Furthermore, we show a variety of counter-intuitive performance artefacts including the performance impact of using multiple tables to classify flows of packets."], "Here, we introduce the current stage and future directions of the wireless infrastructure of the Korea Research Environment Open NETwork (KREONET), a representative national research and education network in Korea. In 2018, ScienceLoRa, a pioneering wireless network infrastructure for scientific applications based on low-power wide-area network technology, was launched. Existing in-service applications in monitoring regions, research facilities, and universities prove the effectiveness of using wireless infrastructure in scientific areas. Furthermore, to support the more stringent requirements of various scientific scenarios, ScienceLoRa is evolving toward ScienceIoT by employing high-performance wireless technology and distributed computing capability. Specifically, by accommodating a private 5G network and an integrated edge computing platform, ScienceIoT is expected to support cutting-edge scientific applications requiring high-throughput and distributed data processing.", "The development of bioinspired switchable adhesive systems has promising solutions in various industrial/medical applications. Switchable and perceptive adhesion regardless of the shape or surface shape of the object is still challenging in dry and aquatic surroundings. We developed an electronic sensory soft adhesive device that recapitulates the attaching, mechanosensory, and decision-making capabilities of a soft adhesion actuator. The soft adhesion actuator of an artificial octopus sucker may precisely control its robust attachment against surfaces with various topologies in wet environments as well as a rapid detachment upon deflation. Carbon nanotube-based strain sensors are three-dimensionally coated onto the irregular surface of the artificial octopus sucker to mimic nerve-like functions of an octopus and identify objects via patterns of strain distribution. An integration with machine learning complements decision-making capabilities to predict the weight and center of gravity for samples with diverse shapes, sizes, and mechanical properties, and this function may be useful in turbid water or fragile environments, where it is difficult to utilize vision.", "In the past decades, technology-based agriculture, also known as Precision Agriculture (PA) or smart farming, has grown, developing new technologies and innovative tools to manage data for the whole agricultural processes. In this framework, geographic information, and spatial data and tools such as UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) and multispectral optical sensors play a crucial role in the geomatics as support techniques. PA needs software to store and process spatial data and the Free and Open Software System (FOSS) community kept pace with PA's needs: several FOSS software tools have been developed for data gathering, analysis, and restitution. The adoption of FOSS solutions, WebGIS platforms, open databases, and spatial data infrastructure to process and store spatial and nonspatial acquired data helps to share information among different actors with user-friendly solutions. Nevertheless, a comprehensive open-source platform that, besides processing UAV data, allows directly storing, visualising, sharing, and querying the final results and the related information does not exist. Indeed, today, the PA's data elaboration and management with a FOSS approach still require several different software tools. Moreover, although some commercial solutions presented platforms to support management in PA activities, none of these present a complete workflow including data from acquisition phase to processed and stored information. In this scenario, the paper aims to provide UAV and PA users with a FOSS-replicable methodology that can fit farming activities' operational and management needs. Therefore, this work focuses on developing a totally FOSS workflow to visualise, process, analyse, and manage PA data. In detail, a multidisciplinary approach is adopted for creating an operative web-sharing tool able to manage Very High Resolution (VHR) agricultural multispectral-derived information gathered by UAV systems. A vineyard in Northern Italy is used as an example to show the workflow of data generation and the data structure of the web tool. A UAV survey was carried out using a six-band multispectral camera and the data were elaborated through the Structure from Motion (SfM) technique, resulting in 3 cm resolution orthophoto. A supervised classifier identified the phenological stage of under-row weeds and the rows with a 95% overall accuracy. Then, a set of GIS-developed algorithms allowed Individual Tree Detection (ITD) and spectral indices for monitoring the plant-based phytosanitary conditions. A spatial data structure was implemented to gather the data at canopy scale. The last step of the workflow concerned publishing data in an interactive 3D webGIS, allowing users to update the spatial database. The webGIS can be operated from web browsers and desktop GIS. The final result is a shared open platform obtained with nonproprietary software that can store data of different sources and scales.", "Sensor-based irrigation can be used to optimize crop production and deliver water precisely on demand. However, commercially available control systems can be expensive. To reduce the cost of automated irrigation systems, researchers have used alternative low-cost open-source platforms coupled to capacitive sensors that can monitor volumetric soil water content (VWC) in real-time, allowing on-demand water supply to plants. This study aims to design and develop a low-cost open-source irrigation system using a prototyping platform connected to soil moisture sensors to monitor and control irrigation automatically. And additionally, determine the water use efficiency of two cherry tomato (Solanum lycopersicum var. cerasiforme) cultivars grown using the system. The platform was designed, assembled, and tested to verify the ability to trigger irrigation on-demand at four different VWC thresholds at 0.23, 0.30, 0.37, and 0.44 m(3) m(-3). The setup used a microcontroller (Arduino Mega 2560 Rev3; Arduino, Ivrea, Italy) connected to soil moisture sensors (10HS; METER Group, Pullman, WA) and relay drivers (Adafruit; New York, NY, USA) to trigger irrigation automatically. This manuscript explains how to assemble the system using commercial equipment readily available in the market. Results indicate that the low-cost open-source platform and soil moisture sensors successfully monitored soil VWC and reliable controlled irrigation in cherry tomatoes. The technology significantly improved water use efficiency with the increase in VWC to trigger the system automatically.", "More than 60 years ago, Richard Feynman gave a lecture titled \"There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom: An Invitation to Enter a New Field of Physics\", where he called on others to join the then-nascent field of nanotechnology. In a similar spirit, we wish to invite chemists, biologists, physicists, bioengineers, educators, high school students, and inventors of all backgrounds to join us in the emerging field of frugal science. In this Review, we define frugal science and use six case studies to describe the broad applications of frugal science, from synthetic biology to disease diagnostics. We conclude by establishing an argument for curiosity-driven research through frugal science to enable broader access in chemical and bioengineering research and drive innovation.", ["Domain-specific accelerators obtain performance benefits by restricting their algorithmic domain. These accelerators utilize specialized languages constrained to particular hardware, thus trading off expressiveness for high performance. The pendulum has swung from one hardware for all domains (general-purpose processors) to one hardware per individual domain. The middle-ground on this spectrum-which provides a unified computational stack across multiple, but not all, domains-is an emerging and open research challenge. This paper sets out to explore this region and its associated tradeoff between expressiveness and performance by defining a cross-domain stack, dubbed PolyMath. This stack defines a high-level cross-domain language (CDL), called PMLang, that in a modular and reusable manner encapsulates mathematical properties to be expressive across multiple domains-Robotics, Graph Analytics, Digital Signal Processing, Deep Learning, and Data Analytics. PMLang is backed by a recursively-defined intermediate representation allowing simultaneous access to all levels of operation granularity, called srDFG. Accelerator-specific or domain-specific IRs commonly capture operations in the granularity that best fits a set of Domain-Specific Architectures (DSAs). In contrast, the recursive nature of the srDFG enables simultaneous access to all the granularities of computation for every operation, thus forming an ideal bridge for converting to various DSA-specific IRs across multiple domains. Our stack unlocks multi-acceleration for end-to-end applications that cross the boundary of multiple domains each comprising different data and compute patterns.", "Evaluations show that by using PolyMath it is possible to harness accelerators across the five domains to realize an average speedup of 3.3 x over a Xeon CPU along with 18.1 x reduction in energy. In comparison to Jetson Xavier and Titan XP, cross-domain acceleration offers 1.7 x and 7.2 x improvement in performance-per-watt, respectively. We measure the cross-domain expressiveness and performance tradeoff by comparing each benchmark against its hand-optimized implementation to achieve 83.9% and 76.8% of the optimal performance for single-domain algorithms and end-to-end applications. For the two case studies of end-to-end applications (comprising algorithms from multiple domains), results show that accelerating all kernels offers an additional 2.0 x speedup over CPU, 6.1 x improvement in performance-per-watt over Titan Xp, and 2.8 x speedup over Jetson Xavier compared to only the one most effective single-domain kernel being accelerated. Finally, we examine the utility and expressiveness of PolyMath through a user study, which shows, on average, PolyMath requires 1.9 x less time to implement algorithms from two different domains with 2.5 x fewer lines of code relative to Python."], "Known as an artificial intelligence subarea, Swarm Robotics is a developing study field investigating bio-inspired collaborative control approaches and integrates a huge collection of agents, reasonably plain robots, in a distributed and decentralized manner. It offers an inspiring essential platform for new researchers to be engaged and share new knowledge to examine their concepts in analytical and heuristic strategies. This paper introduces an overview of current activities in Swarm Robotics and examines the present literature in this area to establish to approach between a realistic swarm robotic system and real-world enforcements. First, we review several Swarm Intelligence concepts to define Swarm Robotics systems, reporting their essential qualities and features and contrast them to generic multi-robotic systems. Second, we report a review of the principal projects that allow realistic study of Swarm Robotics. We demonstrate knowledge regarding current hardware platforms and multi-robot simulators. Finally, the forthcoming promissory applications and the troubles to surpass with a view to achieving them have been described and analyzed.", "This work focuses on the design and construction of an experimental test bench of three degrees of freedom with application in educational environments. It is constituted by a gyroscopic structure that allows the movements of a quadcopter to analyze the control systems. In this context, the main features of the mechanical and electronic design of this prototype are described. At the same time, the main characteristics with respect to existing platforms are highlighted in aspects such as: system autonomy, cost, safety level, operation ranges, experimental flexibility, among others. The possible controller design approaches for quadcopter stabilization can extend to many basic and advanced techniques. In this work, to show the operation and didactic use of the platform, the development of the controller for tilt angle stabilization under two different approaches are presented. The first approach is through PID control, oriented for undergraduate students with basic level in control theory. The second approach is by means of State Feedback, oriented to students with more advanced level in this field. The result of this work is an open test bench, enabled for the experimentation of control algorithms using Matlab-Simulink.", "Precise time underpins critical infrastructure in modern society, including telecommunications, computer networks, electrical power grids and broadcasting. At present, Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) provide the timing signals that are used by these applications; however, time signals delivered over fibre links can offer higher performance. The high accuracy time transfer achievable by fibre is important for synchronising clocks in high-end scientific research projects such as particle accelerators and radio telescope arrays. In addition, distributing time over an optical fibre directly from a timing institute can provide resiliency, accuracy and traceability to the international time scale Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). These are key requirements for timing in industry and commerce, and in applications such as the timestamping of financial trades, fibre distribution offers a secure alternative to time from GNSS. This article will present techniques for distributing time by fibre that are commercially available and widely used for applications in industry, science and metrology.", "Providing security and privacy to wireless sensor nodes (WSNs) is very challenging, due to the heterogeneity of sensor nodes and their limited capabilities in terms of energy, processing power and memory. The applications for these systems run in a myriad of sensors with different low-level programming abstractions, limited capabilities and different routing protocols. This means that applications for WSNs need mechanisms for self-adaptation and for self-protection based on the dynamic adaptation of the algorithms used to provide security. Dynamic software product lines (DSPLs) allow managing both variability and dynamic software adaptation, so they can be considered a key technology in successfully developing self-protected WSN applications. In this paper, we propose a self-protection solution for WSNs based on the combination of the INTER-TRUST security framework (a solution for the dynamic negotiation and deployment of security policies) and the FamiWare middleware (a DSPL approach to automatically configure and reconfigure instances of a middleware for WSNs). We evaluate our approach using a case study from the intelligent transportation system domain.", "This half day course introduces the field of musical interface design and implementation. Participants will learn and practice key aspects of the theory and practice of designing original interactive music technology with case studies including augmented and sensor based instruments, audio-visual instruments, mobile, and networked music making. Digital technologies offer powerful opportunities for the creation and manipulation of sound, however the flexibility of these technologies implies a confusing array of choices for musical composers and performers. Some artists have faced this challenge by using computers directly to create new musical forms. However, most would agree the computer is not a musical instrument, in the same sense as traditional instruments, and it is natural to ask 'how to play the computer' in a way appropriate to human brains and bodies. To attempt to answer this question in the course, we draw from the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) [1,2], which began as a workshop of CHI 2001 [3] and explore connections with the established field of human-computer interaction.", "We propose a framework for Google Map aided UAV navigation in GPS-denied environment. Geo-referenced navigation provides drift-free localization and does not require loop closures. The UAV position is initialized via correlation, which is simple and efficient. We then use optical flow to predict its position in subsequent frames. During pose tracking, we obtain inter-frame translation either by motion field or homography decomposition, and we use HOG features for registration on Google Map. We employ particle filter to conduct a coarse to fine search to localize the UAV. Offline test using aerial images collected by our quadrotor platform shows promising results as our approach eliminates the drift in dead-reckoning, and the small localization error indicates the superiority of our approach as a supplement to GPS.", "This work proposes the design of Environmental Sensor Networks (ESN) through balancing robustness and redundancy. An Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) is employed to find the optimal placement of sensor nodes in the Region of Interest (RoI). Data quality issues are introduced to simulate their impact on the performance of the ESN. Spatial Regression Test (SRT) is also utilised to promote robustness in data quality of the designed ESN. The proposed method provides high network representativeness (fit for purpose) with minimum sensor redundancy (cost), and ensures robustness by enabling the network to continue to achieve its objectives when some sensors fail.", "This paper represents an Automated Balancing Platform using Arduino Uno(ATmega328 microcontroller). Arduino is a low-cost popular prototyping platform. In this project Arduino Uno is used to process any disturbance and give instruction to balancing mechanism to set its location at the set point. The system consists of Arduino Uno platform, 3 DC motors (12V, 500mA), two L298 (46V, 4A), position controlling mechanism of platform, two degree of freedom robotic arm which is placed on the Automated Balancing platform.", "5G RAN aims to evolve new technologies spanning the Cloud infrastructure, virtualization techniques and Software Defined Network capabilities. Advanced solutions are introduced to split the functions of the Radio Access Network (RAN) between centralized and distributed locations. Such paradigms improve RAN flexibility and reduce the infrastructure deployment cost without impacting the user quality of service. We propose a novel functional split orchestration scheme that aims at minimizing the RAN deployment cost, while considering the requirements of its processing network functions and the capabilities of the Cloud infrastructure. With a fine grained approach on user basis, we show that the proposed solution optimizes both processing and bandwidth resource usage, while minimizing the overall energy consumption compared to i) cell-centric, ii) distributed and iii) centralized Cloud-RAN approaches. Moreover, we evaluate the effectiveness of our proposal in a 5G experimental prototype, based on Open Air Interface (OAI). We show that our solution achieves good performance in terms of total deployment cost and resolution time.", "There are multiple factors affecting the behavior of water properties in an estuary, including the hydraulic properties of rivers and corresponding receiving water bodies, along with the potential solutes brought by rivers. Although there are various numerical models and analytical approaches to solving particular or holistic problems in estuaries, measurements are inevitably required. In this study, we developed an innovative low-cost probe based on the Arduino platform as an alternative to more expensive measuring systems. Our device is designed to measure position, temperature, and electrical conductivity in multiple realizations, and it consists of a floating container equipped with the following components: an Arduino Mega development board, a power management module, an SD card logging module, a Bluetooth module, a temperature measuring module, a global positioning satellite (GPS) position module, and a newly developed module for measuring electrical conductivity (EC). We emphasize that all used tools are open-source and greatly supported by the worldwide community. We tested our probe during a field campaign conducted at the estuary of River Jadro near Split (Croatia). Nine probes were released at the river mouth and their position, temperature, and EC were monitored and recorded during the experiment, which ended when the probes stopped, due to the river plume attenuation. The same experiment was repeated three times. All of the probes recorded consistent temperature data, while the EC data show more variable behavior, due to the higher sensitivity of the corresponding sensor. This was expected as a part of the natural process in the estuary. The measured data were additionally used to parameterize an analytical model for mean flow velocity and salinity as a proxy concentration. This showed a good match between the experimental results and the theoretical framework. This work, although focused on water surface applications in the near field zone of an estuary, should be considered as a promising step toward the development of innovative and affordable measurement devices.", "Operating Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) in subterranean environments is becoming more and more relevant in the field of aerial robotics. Despite the large spectrum of technological advances in the field, flying in such challenging environments is still an ongoing quest that requires the combination of multiple sensor modalities like visual/thermal cameras as well as 3D and 2D lidars. Nevertheless, there exist cases in subterranean environments where the aim is to deploy fast and lightweight aerial robots for area reckoning purposes after an event (e.g. blasting in production areas). This work proposes a novel baseline approach for the navigation of resource constrained robots, introducing the aerial underground scout, with the main goal to rapidly explore unknown areas and provide a feedback to the operator. The main proposed framework focuses on the navigation, control and vision capabilities of the aerial platforms with low-cost sensor suites, contributing significantly towards real-life applications. The merit of the proposed control architecture is that it considers the flying platform as a floating object, composing a velocity controller on the x, y axes and altitude control to navigate along the tunnel. Two novel approaches make up the cornerstone of the proposed contributions for the task of navigation: (1) a vector geometry method based on 2D lidar, and (2) a Deep Learning (DL) method through a classification process based on an on-board image stream, where both methods correct the heading towards the center of the mine tunnel. Finally, the framework has been evaluated in multiple field trials in an underground mine in Sweden. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The core instrument modules will be launched in 2019 for the 400th anniversary of Johannes Kepler's Harmonies of the World, in which he laid out a framework for the harmony of geometric form as well as the three laws of planetary motion. Kepler's own experimental process can be understood as audio-first because he employed his understanding of Western Classical music theory to investigate and discover the heliocentric, elliptical behaviour of planetary orbits. Indeed, principles of harmonic motion govern much of our physical world and show up at all scales in mathematics and physics. Few physical systems, however, offer such rich harmonic complexity and beauty as our own solar system. Concordia is a musical instrument that is modular, extensible and designed to allow players to generate and explore transparent sonifications of planetary movements rooted in the musical and mathematical concepts of Johannes Kepler as well as researchers who have extended Kepler's work, such as Hartmut Warm. Its primary function is to emphasise the auditory experience by encouraging musical explorations using sonification of geometric and relational information of scientifically accurate planetary ephemeris and astrodynamics. Concordia highlights harmonic relationships of the solar system through interactive sonic immersion. This article explains how we prioritise data sonification and then add visualisations and gamification to create a new type of experience and creative distributed-ledger powered ecosystem. Kepler Concordia facilitates the perception of music while presenting the celestial harmonies through multiple senses, with an emphasis on hearing, so that, as Kepler wrote, 'the mind can seize upon the patterns'.", "Robotic assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS) systems present many advantages to the surgeon and patient over open and standard laparoscopic surgery. However, haptic feedback, which is crucial for the success of many surgical procedures, is still an open challenge in RAMIS. Understanding the way that haptic feedback affects performance and learning can be useful in the development of haptic feedback algorithms and teleoperation control systems. In this study, we examined the performance and learning of inexperienced participants under different haptic feedback conditions in a task of surgical needle driving via a soft homogeneous deformable object-an artificial tissue. We designed an experimental setup to characterize their movement trajectories and the forces that they applied on the artificial tissue. Participants first performed the task in an open condition, with a standard surgical needle holder, followed by teleoperation in one of three feedback conditions: (1) no haptic feedback, (2) haptic feedback based on position exchange, and (3) haptic feedback based on direct recording from a force sensor, and then again with the open needle holder. To quantify the effect of different force feedback conditions on the quality of needle driving, we developed novel metrics that assess the kinematics of needle driving and the tissue interaction forces, and we combined our novel metrics with classical metrics. We analyzed the final teleoperated performance in each condition, the improvement during teleoperation, and the aftereffect of teleoperation on the performance when using the open needle driver. We found that there is no significant difference in the final performance and in the aftereffect between the 3 conditions. Only the two conditions with force feedback presented statistically significant improvement during teleoperation in several of the metrics, but when we compared directly between the improvements in the three different feedback conditions none of the effects reached statistical significance. We discuss possible explanations for the relative similarity in performance. We conclude that we developed several new metrics for the quality of surgical needle driving, but even with these detailed metrics, the advantage of state of the art force feedback methods to tasks that require interaction with homogeneous soft tissue is questionable.", "Nowadays, the concept of \"Everything is connected to Everything\" has spread to reach increasingly diverse scenarios, due to the benefits of constantly being able to know, in real-time, the status of your factory, your city, your health or your smallholding. This wide variety of scenarios creates different challenges such as the heterogeneity of IoT devices, support for large numbers of connected devices, reliable and safe systems, energy efficiency and the possibility of using this system by third-parties in other scenarios. A transversal middleware in all IoT solutions is called an IoT platform. the IoT platform is a piece of software that works like a kind of \"glue\" to combine platforms and orchestrate capabilities that connect devices, users and applications/services in a \"cyber-physical\" world. In this way, the IoT platform can help solve the challenges listed above. This paper proposes an IoT agnostic architecture, highlighting the role of the IoT platform, within a broader ecosystem of interconnected tools, aiming at increasing scalability, stability, interoperability and reusability. For that purpose, different paradigms of computing will be used, such as microservices architecture and serverless computing. Additionally, a technological proposal of the architecture, called SEnviro Connect, is presented. This proposal is validated in the IoT scenario of smart farming, where five IoT devices (SEnviro nodes) have been deployed to improve wine production. A comprehensive performance evaluation is carried out to guarantee a scalable and stable platform.", "Temperature, humidity and precipitation have a strong influence on the generation of diseases in different crops, especially in vine. In recent years, advances in different disciplines have enabled the deployment of sensor nodes on agricultural plots. These sensors are characterised by a low cost and so the reliability of the data obtained from them can be compromised, as they are built from low-confidence components. In this research, two studies were carried out to determine the reliability of the data obtained by different SEnviro nodes installed in vineyards. Two networks of meteorological stations were used to carry out these studies, one official and the other professional. The first study was based on calculating the homogenisation of the data, which was performed using the Climatol tool. The second study proposed a similarity analysis using cross-correlation. The results showed that the low-cost node can be used to monitor climatic conditions in an agricultural area in the central zone of the province of Castello (Spain) and to obtain reliable observations for use in previously published fungal disease models.", "In this paper, we critically review the current state-of-the-art for sensor network applications and approaches that have developed in response to the recent rise of low-cost technologies. We specifically focus on water-related low-cost sensor networks, and conceptualize them as socio-technical systems that can address resource management challenges and opportunities at three scales of resolution: (1) technologies, (2) users and scenarios, and (3) society and communities. Building this argument, first we identify a general structure for building low-cost sensor networks by assembling technical components across configuration levels. Second, we identify four application categories, namely operational monitoring, scientific research, system optimization, and community development, each of which has different technical and nontechnical configurations that determine how, where, by whom, and for what purpose low-cost sensor networks are used. Third, we discuss the governance factors (e.g., stakeholders and users, networks sustainability and maintenance, application scenarios, and integrated design) and emerging technical opportunities that we argue need to be considered to maximize the added value and long-term societal impact of the next generation of sensor network applications. We conclude that consideration of the full range of socio-technical issues is essential to realize the full potential of sensor network technologies for society and the environment.", ["Systolic algorithms are one of the killer applications on spatial architectures such as FPGAs and CGRAs. However, it requires a tremendous amount of human effort to design and implement a high-performance systolic array for a given algorithm using the traditional RTL-based methodology. On the other hand, existing high-level synthesis (HLS) tools either (1) force the programmers to do \"micro-coding\" where too many optimizations must be carried out through tedious code restructuring and insertion of vendor-specific pragmas, or (2) give them too little control to influence a push-button compilation flow to achieve high quality of results.", "To tackle these challenges, we introduce SuSy, a programming framework composed of a domain-specific language (DSL) and a compilation flow that enables programmers to productively build high-performance systolic arrays on FPGAs. With SuSy, programmers express the design functionality in the form of uniform recurrence equations (UREs), which can describe algorithms from a wide spectrum of applications as long as the underlying computation has a uniform dependence structure. The URE description in SuSy is followed by a set of decoupled spatial mapping primitives that specify how to map the equations to a spatial architecture. More concretely, programmers can apply space-time transformations and several other memory and I/O optimizations to build a highly efficient systolic architecture productively. Experimental results show that SuSy can describe various algorithms with UREs and generate high-performance systolic arrays by spatial optimizations. For instance, the SGEMM benchmark written in SuSy can approach the performance of the manual design optimized by experts, while using 30x fewer lines of code."], "Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide insight into the way object data on Thingiverse changes over time, analyzing the relationships among views, downloads, likes, makes, remixes and comments over 500 days. Design/methodology/approach In total, 30 of the most popular things on Thingiverse were tracked between August 26, 2018 and January 7, 2020, with data collected about the different interactions at five intervals. Findings Highlights include: \"#3DBenchy\" became the first thing to reach one million downloads during this study. The \"Xbox One controller mini wheel\" achieved the highest documented download rate of 698 downloads per day. The average conversion rate from downloads to makes for all 30 things was one make for every 474 downloads at the start of the study, declining to one make for every 784 downloads by the conclusion. Research limitations/implications With over 1.6 million things on Thingiverse, this study focused on an exclusive group of things that have gained significant attention from makers and does not represent most things on the platform. Practical implications Although often considered a novelty or niche maker community, this research shows that things on Thingiverse are achieving popularity comparable to digital music, video and imagery, and a large ecosystem of things has been growing that has implications for designers, manufacturers, supply chain managers and universal popular culture. Originality/value This is the first study to track the digital behaviors of 3D printable things over time, revealing new knowledge about how people interact with content and the scale of these interactions.", "In-ear EEG offers a promising path toward usable, discreet brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for both healthy individuals and persons with disabilities. To test the promise of this modality, we produced a brain-based authentication system using custom-fit EEG earpieces. In a sample of N = 7 participants, we demonstrated that our system has high accuracy, higher than prior work using non-custom earpieces. We demonstrated that both inherence and knowledge factors contribute to authentication accuracy, and performed a simulated attack to show our system's robustness against impersonation. From an authentication standpoint, our system provides three factors of authentication in a single step. From a usability standpoint, our system does not require a cumbersome, head-worn device.", "In this work we propose and implement the use of software defined optical interferometry for the development of laser ultrasound non-destructive testing. The interferometer is conceived as an optoelectronic system that can be controlled by software. The system itself consists of five interconnected blocks: an optical system (a heterodyne interferometer), an Electrical-Optical block (a laser + an acousto-optic modulator), an Optical-Electrical block (a balanced photodetector), a software defined hardware (a software defined radio platform), and a programmable controller (a personal computer). In particular, the selected software defined hardware includes a field programmable radio frequency transceiver. On the one hand, it can synthesize the stimulus signals for the acousto-optic modulator which splits the reference and test beams. On the other hand, it can process the photo-detected high-frequency signals accordingly. This software defined radio platform not only simplifies the experimental scheme but also has such a high sensibility that provides a wide dynamic range. In order to show the performance of the system for non-destructive testing, we analyze the signals produced on aluminium plates to detect flaws in weld seams.", "The global energy production model is changing from fossil fuels to renewable and nuclear energies. Concentrated solar power is one of the growing technologies that is leading this process. This growth implies the sophistication and size of the systems and, therefore, it requires an increase in maintenance tasks to ensure reliability, availability, maintainability and safety. The aim of this paper is to describe the current context of concentrated solar power, to summarise and analyse the main degradation mechanisms and the main techniques to detect, prevent and mitigate these faults. An exhaustive literature study is presented, considering the most advanced techniques and approaches. A novel qualitative and quantitative analysis of the literature is provided. Finally, the current trends and the future challenges in this field are gathered from this study.", "Online communities that form through the introduction of socio-technical platforms require significant effort to cultivate and sustain. Providing open, transparent information on community behaviour can motivate participation from community members themselves, while also providing platform administrators with detailed interaction dynamics. However, challenges arise in both understanding what information is conducive to engagement and sustainability, and then how best to represent this information to platform stake-holders. Towards a better understanding of these challenges, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a set of simple visualisations integrated into a Collective Awareness Platform for Social Innovation platform titled commonfare.net. We discuss the promise and challenge of bringing social innovation into the digital age, in terms of supporting sustained platform use and collective action, and how the introduction of community visualisations has been directed towards achieving this goal.", "3D user interfaces (3DUI) are increasingly used in a number of applications, spanning from entertainment to industrial design. However, 3D interaction tasks are generally more complex for users since interacting with a 3D environment is more cognitively demanding than perceiving and interacting with a 2D one. As such, it is essential that we could evaluate finely user experience, in order to propose seamless interfaces. To do so, a promising research direction is to measure users' inner-state based on brain signals acquired during interaction, by following a neuroergonomics approach. Combined with existing methods, such tool can be used to strengthen the understanding of user experience. In this paper, we review the work being undergone in this area; what has been achieved and the new challenges that arise. We describe how a mobile brain imaging technique such as electroencephalography (EEG) brings continuous and non-disruptive measures. EEG-based evaluation of users can give insights about multiple dimensions of the user experience, with realistic interaction tasks or novel interfaces. We investigate four constructs: workload, attention, error recognition and visual comfort. Ultimately, these metrics could help to alleviate users when they interact with computers.", "In this paper, we present a tiny networked mobile platform, termed Tiny-Web-Thing (T-Wing), which allows the sharing of data-intensive content among objects in cyber physical systems. The object includes mobile platforms like a smartphone, and Internet of Things (IoT) platforms for Human-to-Human (H2H), Human-to-Machine (H2M), Machine-to-Human (M2H), and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications. T-Wing makes it possible to host rich web content directly on their objects, which nearby objects can access instantaneously. Using a new mechanism that allows the Wi-Fi interface of the object to be turned on purely on-demand, T-Wing achieves very high energy efficiency. We have implemented T-Wing on an embedded board, and present evaluation results from our testbed. From the evaluation result of T-Wing, we compare our system against alternative approaches to implement this functionality using only the cellular or Wi-Fi (but not both), and show that in typical usage, T-Wing consumes less than 15 x the energy and is faster by an order of magnitude.", "Tilt-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles have attracted increasing attention due to their ability to perform vertical take-off and landing and their high-speed cruising abilities, thereby presenting broad application prospects. Considering portability and applications in tasks characterized by constrained or small scope areas, this article presents a compact tricopter configuration tilt-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle with full modes of flight from the rotor mode to the fixed-wing mode and vice versa. The unique multiple modes make the tilt-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle a multi-input multi-output, non-affine, multi-channel cross coupling, and nonlinear system. Considering these characteristics, a control allocation method is designed to make the controller adaptive to the full modes of flight. To reduce the cost, the accurate dynamic model of the tilt-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle is not obtained, so a full-mode flight strategy is designed in view of this situation. An autonomous flight test was conducted, and the results indicate the satisfactory performance of the control allocation method and flight strategy.", "The high stakes of emergent environmental crises, from climate change to widespread toxic exposures, have motivated STS practitioners to innovate methodologically, including leveraging STS scholarship to actively remake environmental scientific practice and technologies. This thematic collection brings together current research that transforms how communities and academics identify, study, and collectively respond to contaminants engendered by the fossil fuel and petrochemical industries, including air contamination from hydraulic fracking, marine pollution from petroleum-derived plastics, and hydrocarbon derivatives such as formaldehyde that intoxicate our homes. These interventions make inroads into the \"undone science\" and \"regimes of imperceptibility\" of environmental health crises. Authors, most of whom are practitioners, investigate grassroots methods for collaboratively designing and developing low-cost monitoring tools, crowdsourcing data analysis, and imagining ways of redressing toxicity outside of the idioms of science. Collectively, these articles work towards remaking how knowledge is made about and across industrial systems by networking community grounded approaches for accounting for environmental health issues created by the fossil fuels and allied petrochemical industries.", "Data centers have been evolved from a passive element of compute infrastructure to become an active, core part of any ICT solution. In particular, modular data centers (MDCs), which are a promising design approach to improve resiliency of data centers, can play a key role in deploying ICT infrastructure in remote and inhospitable environments in order to take advantage of low temperatures and hydro- and wind-electric capabilities. This is because of capability of the modular data centers to survive even in lack of continuous on site maintenance and support. The most critical part of a data center is its network fabric that could impede the whole system even if all other components are fully functional, assuming that other analyses have been already performed to ensure the reliability of the underlying infrastructure and support systems. In this work, a complete failure analysis of modular data centers using failure models of various components including servers, switches, and links is performed using a proposed Monte-Carlo approach. The proposed Monte-Carlo approach, which is based on the concept of snapshots, allows us to effectively calculate the performance of a design along its lifespan even up to the terminal stages. To show the capabilities of the proposed approach, various network topologies, such as FatTree, BCube, MDCube, and their modifications, are considered. The performance and also the lifespan of each topology design in the presence of failures of their components are studied against the topology parameters.", "The becoming productive of consumer culture has been an important theme for social research. Within neoliberal discourse, the link between consumer culture and new forms of immaterial production has been conceptualized as \"creativity.\" This paper uses the experience of Bangkok's fashion markets to begin to articulate an alternative understanding of the relation between consumer culture and immaterial production, a different kind of \"creativity.\" We suggest that Bangkok's fashion markets manifest a kind of creativity where innovation is highly socialized, as opposed to being oriented around the notion of individual genius and individual intellectual property; where participation is popular as opposed to elite-based and where the ambiguous relation between creation and commercial success that is intrinsic to Western notions of creativity is replaced by an embrace of markets and commerce as vehicles for self-expression. Bangkok's fashion markets represent an example of a market-based commons centered innovation economy.", "This paper presents the design of a smart geyser controller that can relay information between two functional units making use of low power IEEE 802.15.4 radios, with the objective of lowering the power consumption of a household geyser. The first operational unit measures the environmental data of the geyser, i. e. water temperature, voltage, current and power measurements, and also switches the geyser on and off. The other functional unit is used to display information to the user and also connects to a PC where environmental data is stored in a local database for historical review. This database is used to create a priority time table, which forms the basis of the operational optimization algorithm.", "The Internet has not only revolutionized our ways of communication but has also expanded firm's potential sources of innovation. Dahlander and Wallin (2006) have shown that firms deploy their personnel, the so-called man on the inside (MOI), to participate in open source communities in order to unlock the valuable assets that are voluntarily being created in these communities. Focusing on firm-sponsored open source communities, we will detect the functions of MOI and how these individuals influence the community by applying a comparative case study of two open source software firms, which includes interviews with managers and MOI, nemographic and social network analysis of the community interactions of over 12,000 individuals. We conclude that despite the fiery situation of combining open source philosophy with a firm's profit-driven business model, firms can succeed in integrating a community into the firm's development process with the help of the Mat. These key individuals carry out five core capabilities that are crucial to become central nodes in the communication networks.", "The holy grail of smart cities is an integrated, sustainable approach to improve the efficiency of the city's operations and the quality of life of citizens. At the heart of this vision is the citizen, who is the primary beneficiary of smart city initiatives, either directly or indirectly. Despite the recent surge of research and smart cities initiatives in practice, there are still a number of challenges to overcome in realizing this vision. This position paper points out six citizen-related challenges: the engagement of citizens, the improvement of citizens' data literacy, the pairing of quantitative and qualitative data, the need for open standards, the development of personal services, and the development of persuasive interfaces. The article furthermore advocates the use of methods and techniques from GIScience to tackle these challenges, and presents the concept of an Open City Toolkit as a way of transferring insights and solutions from GIScience to smart cities.", "Grand challenges are among the most complex problems for modern societies. Many governments and foundations provide substantial resources to encourage the search for solutions. Due to the significance of these problems, organizations often form partnerships in what we call search consortia to engage in joint search and compete for funding. Prior research on joint search highlights the role of specialized organizations, mainly regarding technological domains, to identify a superior solution. However, stakeholder theory leads us to believe that the success of any solution depends on the acceptance and support of important stakeholders. In this study, we suggest that search consortia are more likely to receive funding when they include representatives of stakeholder concerns, so-called advocacy groups. We extend theory on coordinated exploration in joint search by integrating mechanisms from stakeholder theory and argue that advocacy groups improve the generation of potential solutions and provide legitimacy. We test our theory with a unique dataset of 35,249 consortia that proposed solutions to 2,349 grand challenge problems as part of a large European funding program. Our results show that advocacy groups benefit search consortia, particularly when consortia exhibit a high dispersion of technological knowledge and when they are inexperienced.", "Wide-field optical flow information can benefit the navigation of small or micro unmanned aerial vehicles in GPS-degraded/denied environments, inspired by the study of insect/bird flights. This paper focuses on a flight-test evaluation of navigation information in wide-field optical flow, using flight data collected by a wide-angle camera installed on a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle at altitudes ranging from 30 to 183m above the ground. A comprehensive evaluation methodology is proposed for the comparison between optical flows computed from videos and the reference motion fields determined from conventional navigation sensors including GPS, a laser range finder, and inertial sensors. Seven sets of unmanned aerial vehicle flight data including a total of approximately 72,000 image frames are used for both full-flight temporal evaluation and representative interframe spatial evaluation of wide-field optical flow information for unmanned aerial vehicle navigation purposes. The evaluation results showed a good match between vision-derived optical flows and reference motion fields from conventional navigation sensors. Finally, one benchmark data set is shared at the authors' website for open access from the research community.", "While the conventional vehicle's Head-Units played relatively simple roles (e.g., control of heating ventilation and air conditioning, the radio reception), they have been evolving into vehicle-driver interface with the advent of the concept of Connected Car on top of a rapid development of ICT technology. The Head-Unit is now successfully extended as an IVI (In Vehicle Infotainment) that can operate various functions on multimedia, navigation, information with regards to vehicle's parts (e.g. air pressure, oil gauge, etc.). In this paper, we propose a platform architecture for IVI devices required to achieve the goal as a connected car. Connected car platform (CoCaP) consists of vehicle selective gateway (VSG) for receiving and controlling data from major components of a vehicle, application framework including native and web APIs required to request VSG functionality from outside, and service framework for driver assistance. CoCaP is implemented using Tizen IVI and Android on hardware platforms manufactured for IVI such as Nexcom's VTC1010 and Freescale's i.MX6q/dl, respectively. For more practical verification, CoCaP platform was applied to an real-world finished vehicle. And it was confirmed the vehicle's main components could be controlled using various devices. In addition, by deriving several services for driver assistance and developing them based on CoCaP, this platform is expected to be available in various ways in connected car and ITS environments.", null, "The increasing digitization and interconnection of legacy Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) open new vulnerability surfaces, exposing such systems to malicious attackers. Furthermore, since ICSs are often employed in critical infrastructures (e.g., nuclear plants) and manufacturing companies (e.g., chemical industries), attacks can lead to devastating physical damages. In dealing with this security requirement, the research community focuses on developing new security mechanisms such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), facilitated by leveraging modern machine learning techniques. However, these algorithms require a testing platform and a considerable amount of data to be trained and tested accurately. To satisfy this prerequisite, Academia, Industry, and Government are increasingly proposing testbed (i.e., scaled-down versions of ICSs or simulations) to test the performances of the IDSs. Furthermore, to enable researchers to cross-validate security systems (e.g., security-by-design concepts or anomaly detectors), several datasets have been collected from testbeds and shared with the community. In this paper, we provide a deep and comprehensive overview of ICSs, presenting the architecture design, the employed devices, and the security protocols implemented. We then collect, compare, and describe testbeds and datasets in the literature, highlighting key challenges and design guidelines to keep in mind in the design phases. Furthermore, we enrich our work by reporting the best performing IDS algorithms tested on every dataset to create a baseline in state of the art for this field. Finally, driven by knowledge accumulated during this survey's development, we report advice and good practices on the development, the choice, and the utilization of testbeds, datasets, and IDSs.", "This paper presents the design and implementation detail of an advanced mini quadrotor system, including the low cost commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) electronics and advanced control algorithm. The proposed quadrotor has a gross takeoff weight of 758 g and 360mm frame diagonal size. It is capable of semi-autonomous maneuver in GPS denied environments, solely relying on onboard sensors and computers. A globally defined quadrotor model is formularized, and a nonlinear velocity tracking controller is implemented on the special Euclidean group SE(3). An optical flow and ultrasonic-based onboard downward-facing camera is used as the primary sensor to provide velocity and altitude measurement feedback for the controller. The control and sensor fusion algorithm is developed under Arduino compatible open source electronics.", "Machine learning has become an indispensable part of the existing technological domain. Edge computing and Internet of Things (IoT) together presents a new opportunity to imply machine learning techniques at the resource constrained embedded devices at the edge of the network. Conventional machine learning requires enormous amount of power to predict a scenario. Embedded machine learning - TinyML paradigm aims to shift such plethora from traditional high-end systems to low-end clients. Several challenges are paved while doing such transition such as, maintaining the accuracy of learning models, provide train-to-deploy facility in resource frugal tiny edge devices, optimizing processing capacity, and improving reliability. In this paper, we present an intuitive review about such possibilities for TinyML. We firstly, present background of TinyML. Secondly, we list the tool sets for supporting TinyML. Thirdly, we present key enablers for improvement of TinyML systems. Fourthly, we present state-of-the-art about frameworks for TinyML.

At present, the development of digital and information greenhouse technology has become the focus and difficulty of agricultural development. Based on this, this paper will design a set of agricultural digital greenhouse system based on ZigBee wireless sensor network technology. At the same time, in the corresponding data acquisition and processing problems, this paper uses the PID controller under the particle filter optimization technology to optimize the error of the corresponding data acquisition system, and eliminate the corresponding noise and interference, so as to ensure the stability and effectiveness of the corresponding data acquisition system in the digital greenhouse, reduce the power consumption of the whole system, and ensure the stable transmission of data. Experimental results show that the proposed digital greenhouse technology can not only improve crop yield rapidly, but also optimize the noise control level of key algorithm by 10 points compared with the traditional filtering technology, so it has a long-term promotion significance.

The intelligent irrigation system remains a significant development of the Internet of Things due to the exponential need to make available the right quantity of food at lower agricultural and industrial costs. This work involves studying, designing, and implementing a web application for remote automation of green spaces, \"Smart Green,\" based on a mathematical model. This application aims to control the automatic watering process using an embedded system to optimize water consumption and prevent overwatering. This project consists of three parts: The first part consists of designing an embedded system based on the ESP8266 microcontroller. It allows the automatic control of climate, soil, and plant parameters and sends them over the Internet. The second part is dedicated to building a graphical user interface (GUI) that helps us visualise climatic parameters in real-time (Temperature, Humidity, Soil Moisture) internet connection and save them in a database. Finally, we made a prototype that allowed us to test the performance and the good functioning of our system.", "The rapid spread of COVID-19 has led to a global shortfall in essential items, turning many countries into resource-constrained environments. In response, an unprecedented number of do-it-yourself hobbyists (i.e. makers) have started to use digital fabrication tools to produce critical items. These bottom-up communities are mobilising as part of a global movement to produce innovative solutions to much-needed items, such as face masks, face shields and ventilators. As these individuals tackle widespread resource constraints, the conceptual lens of frugal innovation becomes highly relevant to study how these solutions developed. Frugal innovation is a type of resource-constrained innovation that refers to the practice of doing more with less, for more people. In this study, we present two instrumental case studies of maker projects that use digital fabrication to tackle COVID-19. The first case study is from Italy (a High Income Country) and the second is from India (a Lower Middle Income Country). We analyse the frugality of these cases and highlight their similar approaches. In doing so, we suggest that current theories of frugal innovation can be expanded to new geographical and technological contexts. We put forward that frugal innovation is an important strategy in crisis response beyond emerging markets and that digital fabrication can be considered as an important frugal innovation enabler, both in its ability to produce frugal solutions and to support distributed networks of innovation actors. This study advances knowledge on how frugal innovation unfolds in the Maker movement. It is among one of the first studies to connect the domains of makers and frugal innovation, and the paper concludes by identifying several promising areas for further research.", "The proposed StegoFrameOrder (SFO) method enables the transmission of covert data in wireless computer networks exploiting non-deterministic algorithms of medium access (such as the distributed coordination function), especially in IEEE 802.11 networks. Such a covert channel enables the possibility of leaking crucial information outside secured network in a manner that is difficult to detect. The SFO method embeds hidden bits of information in the relative order of frames transmitted by wireless terminals operating on the same radio channel. The paper presents an idea of this covert channel, its implementation, and possible variants. The paper also discusses implementing the SFO method in a real environment and the experiments performed in the real-world scenario.", "Location and tracking needs are becoming more prominent in industrial environments nowadays. Process optimization, traceability or safety are some of the topics where a positioning system can operate to improve and increase the productivity of a factory or warehouse. Among the different options, solutions based on ultra-wideband (UWB) have emerged during recent years as a good choice to obtain highly accurate estimations in indoor scenarios. However, the typical harsh wireless channel conditions found inside industrial environments, together with interferences caused by workers and machinery, constitute a challenge for this kind of system. This paper describes a real industrial problem (location and tracking of forklift trucks) that requires precise internal positioning and presents a study on the feasibility of meeting this challenge using UWB technology. To this end, a simulator of this technology was created based on UWB measurements from a set of real sensors. This simulator was used together with a location algorithm and a physical model of the forklift to obtain estimations of position in different scenarios with different obstacles. Together with the simulated UWB sensor, an additional inertial sensor and optical sensor were modeled in order to test its effect on supporting the location based on UWB. All the software created for this work is published under an open-source license and is publicly available.", "Radar-based breast imaging has shown promise as an imaging modality for early-stage cancer detection, and clinical investigations of two commercial imaging systems are ongoing. Many imaging algorithms have been proposed, which seek to improve the quality of the reconstructed microwave image to enhance the potential clinical decision. However, in many cases, the radar-based imaging algorithms have only been tested in limited numerical or experimental test cases or with simplifying assumptions such as using one estimate of permittivity for all patient test cases. In this work, the potential impact of patient-specific permittivity estimation on algorithm comparison is highlighted using representative experimental breast phantoms. In particular, the case studies presented help show that the permittivity estimate can impact the conclusions of the algorithm comparison. Overall, this work suggests that it is important that imaging algorithm comparisons use realistic test cases with and without breast abnormalities and with reconstruction permittivity estimation.", null, ["Background", "Contact networks can be used to assess disease spread potential within a population. However, the data required to generate the networks can be challenging to collect. One method of collecting this type of data is by using radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags. The OpenBeacon RFID system generally consists of tags and readers. Communicating tags should be within 10m of the readers, which are powered by an external power source. The readers are challenging to implement in agricultural settings due to the lack of a power source and the large area needed to be covered.", "Methods", "OpenBeacon firmware was modified to use the tag's onboard flash memory for data storage. The tags were deployed within an equine facility for a 7-day period. Tags were attached to the horses' halters, worn by facility staff, and placed in strategic locations around the facility to monitor which participants had contact with the specified locations during the study period. When the tags came within 2m of each other, they recorded the contact event participant IDs, and start and end times. At the end of the study period, the data were downloaded to a computer and analyzed using network analysis methods.", "Results", "The resulting networks were plausible given the facility schedule as described in a survey completed by the facility manager. Furthermore, changes in the daily facility operations as described in the survey were reflected in the tag-collected data. In terms of the battery life, 88% of batteries maintained a charge for at least 6 days. Lastly, no consistent trends were evident in the horses' centrality metrics.", "Discussion", "This study demonstrates the utility of RFID tags for the collection of equine contact data. Future work should include the collection of contact data from multiple equine facilities to better characterize equine disease spread potential in Ontario."], "We present a cyber-physical control system for deployment on a smart pedelec (Ebike). The goal of the control is to manage the interaction between a human and a motor intervention, for applications in which we wish to control physical aspects of the cycling behaviour (e.g. heart rate and breathing rate). The basis of the control is a pitchfork bifurcation system, augmented using ideas from gain-scheduling. Experiments have been conducted, showing the validity of the proposed control strategy. A use case dealing with the regulation of human ventilation characteristics in response to exogenous pollution measurements is presented.", "This paper presents a concept of the universal COTS-based Payload Carrier for new a microsatellite platform designed in compliance with the SpaceVPX ( VITA 78.0) standard. Card functionality can be extended by adding VITA 57.1 FMC Mezzanine cards and therefore cover a wide spectrum of applications, which can be prototyped on off-the-shelf FMC evaluation boards. Selected assumptions of the design, which originate from a minimum 2-year-long mission on LEO and the SpaceVPX standard, are described in the introduction. Further, they are followed by a detailed description of selected components and proposed software required for reliable operation in the space environment. Finally, examples of applications such as communication data link layer processor implemented according to CCSDS standard, DSP processor for Software-Defined-Radio, and interface for dedicated payload computer are described.", "Many embedded systems are implemented for healthcare, and smart homes and spaces. These devices are generally designed for elderly care, for monitoring, surveillance, and collection information. As embedded systems are ubiquitous and pervasive in a smart home, office, or space, different layout affects not only reduce the implementation cost but also the power density of electromagnetic waves. This study aimed to develop a multiple-embedded-system optimization layout to consume less electromagnetic wave power density and gain better communication strength. For smart offices, we analyzed the layout topology ofn-shaped andn-shaped with door layout categories. On the basis of the location of each embedded system in a communication center via ann-shaped layout, we investigated the electromagnetic wave effect to the local, direct, and semidirect effects. Indirect and subindirect effects were also studied in then-shaped layout with a door. In addition, we derived a set of formulas from the scope for the diverse effects to help users to quickly identify the scope of each effect. To verify the multiple-embedded-system optimization layout, 16 cooperating embedded systems with four test cases in a smart office were used to evaluate the diverse effects of electromagnetic wave power density and communication strength. Experiment results showed that the optimization layout consumed 3950 x 10(-6)W/m(2)electromagnetic wave power density.", "The question of how to estimate the state of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in real time in multi-environments remains a challenge. Although the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) has been widely applied, drones cannot perform position estimation when a GNSS signal is not available or the GNSS is disturbed. In this paper, the problem of state estimation in multi-environments is solved by employing an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) algorithm to fuse the data from multiple heterogeneous sensors (MHS), including an inertial measurement unit (IMU), a magnetometer, a barometer, a GNSS receiver, an optical flow sensor (OFS), Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), and an RGB-D camera. Finally, the robustness and effectiveness of the multi-sensor data fusion system based on the EKF algorithm are verified by field flights in unstructured, indoor, outdoor, and indoor and outdoor transition scenarios.", "In this paper we focus on the stochastic kinetic extension of the well-known Hodgkin-Huxley model of a biological neuron. We show the gradient descent algorithm for training of the neuron model. In comparison with training of the Hodgkin-Huxley model we use only three weights instead of nine. We show that the trained stochastic kinetic model gives equally good results as the trained Hodgkin-Huxley model, while we gain on more concise mathematical description of the training procedure. The trained stochastic kinetic model of neuron is tested in solving the problem of approximation, where for the approximated function the membrane potential obtained using different models of a biological neuron was chosen. Additionally, we present a simple application, in which the trained models of neuron connected with the outputs of a recurrent neural network form a system, which is used to calculate the Euler angles of an object's position in space, based on linear and angular acceleration, direction and the magnitude of Earth's magnetic field.", "The use of machines for variable-rate applications is becoming popular in modern agriculture. Due to the presence of imported and complex components, the acquisition cost of these machines is high for smallholder farmers. Several studies have been carried out using low-cost components in the development of precision agriculture machines to facilitate their adoption in low-income agriculture. Thus, the objective of this work was to develop a variable-rate controller for a low-cost precision planter. The system was developed and installed on a 1-row manual planter with a horizontal perforated disk distributor. A direct-current electric motor was used to drive the seed metering device. The angular velocity of the electric motor was controlled by a BeagleBone Black single-board computer. A program was written in Python 3.6 language, and a graphical user interface was generated by using PyQt5. Field trials were performed with maize seeds using a 28-hole disk and a prescription seeding map with four management zones. The row spacing was 0.75 m, and the planter ground speed was close to 1.0 m .s(-1). Field tests showed that the controller was effective at identifying the four management zones and controlling the angular velocity of the motor. By counting the number of plants germinated in the field test, it was verified that the variation in the angular velocity of the motor produced a change in the planting density. At each management zone, the planting density corresponded to the prescribed seeding map. The total cost of the parts used to assemble the controller was US$337.97, characterizing it as low cost. Successful field tests showed the potential for using low-cost components to develop variable-rate machines for smallholder farmers.", "The increasing computational cost of deep neural network models limits the applicability of intelligent applications on resource-constrained edge devices. While a number of neural network pruning methods have been proposed to compress the models, prevailing approaches focus only on parametric operators (e.g., convolution), which may miss optimization opportunities. In this article, we present a novel fusion-catalyzed pruning approach, called FUPRUNER, which simultaneously optimizes the parametric and nonparametric operators for accelerating neural networks. We introduce an aggressive fusion method to equivalently transform a model, which extends the optimization space of pruning and enables nonparametric operators to be pruned in a similar manner as parametric operators, and a dynamic filter pruning method is applied to decrease the computational cost of models while retaining the accuracy requirement. Moreover, FUPRUNER provides configurable optimization options for controlling fusion and pruning, allowing much more flexible performance-accuracy tradeoffs to be made. Evaluation with state-of-the-art residual neural networks on five representative intelligent edge platforms, Jetson TX2, Jetson Nano, Edge tensor processing unit, neural compute stick, and neural compute stick 2, demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, which can accelerate the inference of models on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets.", "The world population growth is increasing the demand for food production. Furthermore, the reduction of the workforce in rural areas and the increase in production costs are challenges for food production nowadays. Smart farming is a farm management concept that may use Internet of Things (IoT) to overcome the current challenges of food production. This work uses the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews (PRISMA) methodology to systematically review the existing literature on smart farming with IoT. The review aims to identify the main devices, platforms, network protocols, processing data technologies and the applicability of smart farming with IoT to agriculture. The review shows an evolution in the way data is processed in recent years. Traditional approaches mostly used data in a reactive manner. In more recent approaches, however, new technological developments allowed the use of data to prevent crop problems and to improve the accuracy of crop diagnosis.", "Progress in metabolic engineering and synthetic and systems biology has made bioproduction an increasingly attractive and competitive strategy for synthesizing biomolecules, recombinant proteins and biofuels from renewable feedstocks. Yet, due to poor productivity, it remains difficult to make a bioproduction process economically viable at large scale. Achieving dynamic control of cellular processes could lead to even better yields by balancing the two characteristic phases of bioproduction, namely, growth versus production, which lie at the heart of a trade-off that substantially impacts productivity. The versatility and controllability offered by light will be a key element in attaining the level of control desired. The popularity of light-mediated control is increasing, with an expanding repertoire of optogenetic systems for novel applications, and many optogenetic devices have been designed to test optogenetic strains at various culture scales for bioproduction objectives. In this review, we aim to highlight the most important advances in this direction. We discuss how optogenetics is currently applied to control metabolism in the context of bioproduction, describe the optogenetic instruments and devices used at the laboratory scale for strain development, and explore how current industrial-scale bioproduction processes could be adapted for optogenetics or could benefit from existing photobioreactor designs. We then draw attention to the steps that must be undertaken to further optimize the control of biological systems in order to take full advantage of the potential offered by microbial factories.", "The last decade witnessed a tremendous increase in popularity and usage of social network services, such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. Moreover, advances in Web technologies coupled with social networks has enabled users to not only access, but also generate, content in many forms. The overwhelming amount of produced content and resulting network traffic gives rise to precarious scalability issues for social networks, such as handling a large number of users, infrastructure management, internal network traffic, content dissemination, and data storage. There are few surveys conducted to explore the different dimensions of social networks, such as security, privacy, and data acquisition. Most of the surveys focus on privacy or security-related issues and do not specifically address scalability challenges faced by social networks. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive study of social networks along with their significant characteristics and categorize social network architectures into three broad categories: (a) centralized, (b) decentralized, and (c) hybrid. We also highlight various scalability issues faced by social network architectures. Finally, a qualitative comparison of presented architectures is provided, which is based on various scalability metrics, such as availability, latency, interserver communication, cost of resources, and energy consumption, just to name a few.", "We aim at developing autonomous miniature hovering flying robots capable of navigating in unstructured GPS-denied environments. A major challenge is the miniaturization of the embedded sensors and processors that allow such platforms to fly by themselves. In this paper, we propose a novel ego-motion estimation algorithm for hovering robots equipped with inertial and optic-flow sensors that runs in real-time on a microcontroller and enables autonomous flight. Unlike many vision-based methods, this algorithm does not rely on feature tracking, structure estimation, additional distance sensors or assumptions about the environment. In this method, we introduce the translational optic-flow direction constraint, which uses the optic-flow direction but not its scale to correct for inertial sensor drift during changes of direction. This solution requires comparatively much simpler electronics and sensors and works in environments of any geometry. Here we describe the implementation and performance of the method on a hovering robot equipped with eight 0.65 g optic-flow sensors, and show that it can be used for closed-loop control of various motions.", "Employers are collecting and using their employees' health data, mined from wearable fitness devices and health apps, in new, profitable, and barely regulated ways. The importance of protecting employee health and fitness data will grow exponentially in the future. This is the moment for a robust discussion of how law can better protect employees from the potential misuse of their health data. While scholars have just begun to examine the problem of health data privacy, this Article contributes to the academic literature in three important ways. First, it analyzes the convergence of three trends resulting in an unprecedented growth of health-related data: the Internet of Things, the Quantified Self movement, and the Rise of Health Platforms. Second, it describes the insufficiencies of specific data privacy laws and federal agency actions in the context of protecting employee health data from employer misuse. Finally, it provides two detailed and workable solutions for remedying the current lack of protection of employee health data that will realign employer use with reasonable expectations of health and fitness privacy. The Article proceeds in four Parts. Part I describes the growth of self-monitoring apps, devices, and other sensor-enabled technology that can monitor a wide range of data related to an employee's health and fitness and the relationship of this growth to both the Quantified Self movement and the Internet of Things. Part II explains the increasing use of employee monitoring through a wide range of sensors, including wearable devices, and the potential uses of that health and fitness data. Part III explores the various regulations and agency actions that might protect employees from the potential misuse of their health and fitness data and the shortcomings of each. Part IV proposes two specific measures that would help ameliorate the ineffective legal protections that currently exist in this context. In order to improve employee notice of and control over the disclosure of their health data, I recommend the adoption of a mandatory privacy labeling law for health-related devices and apps to be enacted and enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). As a complementary measure, I also recommend that be amended so that its protections extend to the health-related data that employers may acquire about their employees. The Article concludes with suggestions for additional scholarly discussion.", "This paper introduces a novel algorithm to obtain attitude estimations from low cost inertial measurement units including 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis magnetometer. This nonlinear attitude estimator is derived from Lyapunov's theory and formulated in the special orthogonal group SO(3). The impact of the gyroscope bias is also assessed and an online estimator provided. The performance of the proposed estimator is validated and compared to current commonly used methods, namely the classical extended Kalman filter and two other nonlinear estimators in SO(3). Realistic simulations consider a quadcopter unmanned aerial vehicle subject to wind disturbances and whose sensors parameters have been identified from flight tests data.", "Photothermal therapy is an effective means to induce tumor cell death, since tumor tissue is more sensitive to temperature increases than normal tissue. Biological responses depend on tissue temperature; target tissue temperature needs to be precisely measured and controlled to achieve desired thermal effects. In this work, a unique photoacoustic (PA) sensor is proposed for temperature measurement during interstitial laser phototherapy. A continuous-wave laser light and a pulsed laser light, for photothermal irradiation and photoacoustic temperature measurement, respectively, were delivered to the target tissue through a fiber coupler. During laser irradiation, the PA amplitude was measured. The Gruneisen parameter and the bioheat equation were used to determine the temperature in strategic positions in the target tissue. Our results demonstrate that the interstitial PA amplitude is a linear function of temperature in the range of 22 to 55 degrees C, as confirmed by thermocouple measurement. Furthermore, by choosing appropriate laser parameters, the maximum temperature surrounding the active diffuse fiber tip in tissue can be controlled in the range of 41 to 55 degrees C. Thus, this sensor could potentially be used for fast, accurate, and convenient three-dimensional temperature measurement, and for real-time feedback and control of interstitial laser phototherapy in cancer treatment.", "Online hospitality exchange (HospEx) platforms-essentially facilitating the connection between a traveller and a local resident-embody many of the cyber-utopian promises intrinsic to the Web as it started out 25 years ago. This paper investigates upon the antagonistic struggle between the commons and processes of commodification in the light of critical theory of social media for this niche social networking space and introduces two relevant examples. The biggest of those platforms, Couchsurfing. org, changed its organizational orientation from a non-profit, commons-based project towards a for-profit company in 2011-an instance of commodification. An analysis of both quantitative and qualitative community data shows that the transformation consequently concerns members on multiple levels. The structural change of ownership results in a loss of transparency and privacy, an alteration of the platform's integrity, a sacrifice of the \"uniqueness\" of the community, and a differing relationship between the user and the platform. To discuss an alternative, community-based governance approach, the paper further explores the specifics of a platform guided by the logic of the commons, the non-commercial and non-profit HospEx platform BeWelcome.org.", "This paper presents an analysis of data collected through the Waterloo WeBike project: a field trial in which over 30 sensor-equipped electric bicycles (e-bikes) were given to members of the University of Waterloo for personal use. Our dataset includes e-bike trips and battery charging sessions spanning nearly three years, from summer 2014 until spring 2017. We also conducted three surveys both before and during the trial. Our main findings were that the primary purpose of the e-bikes in our trial was for commuting, with most trips lasting less than 20 minutes and most trips taking place in the summer months. Our battery charging analysis revealed no evidence of range anxiety, and our analysis of survey results showed little correlation between anticipated and actual use. Furthermore, when asked about their opinions about various modes of transportation, our participants rated regular bicycles higher than e-bikes even after becoming familiar with e-bikes through the field trial. Based on our analysis, we draw several conclusions, including the fact that the general population in Canada is still unaware of e-bikes and their potential. Moreover, e-bike manufacturers should target sales to nonbike users, such as seniors, rather than trying to displace sales of regular bicycles.", "First responders and other emergency services personnel must often enter buildings which prevent the use of GPS or other satellite navigation signals for positioning. Loss of navigation capability combined with the fact that the buildings are often unknown to the personnel in question makes it more difficult for individual team members to coordinate with one another, and difficult or impossible for the team leader to monitor and direct the actions of each team member. While inertial navigation or pedestrian dead reckoning provide for some degree of navigation in GPS signal denied environments, these solutions degrade with time and may require prohibitively large and expensive inertial solutions to navigate over extended periods, while also allowing each individual user to accumulate independent positioning errors and thereby appearing to 'drift away' from one another. This paper presents an implementation of a collaborative navigation system utilizing each of user-to-user radio links, Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) when available, inertial navigation, pedestrian dead reckoning, as well as camera based Simultaneous Location and Mapping (SLAM) to provide a team of users with absolute and relative situational awareness for themselves and their team. The application of collaborative navigation to such a team provides the triple benefits of providing improved absolute navigation accuracy, improved relative navigation accuracy, and greatly enhanced situational awareness for all cooperating team members.", "In this paper, a review is presented for the research on eye gaze estimation techniques and applications, which has progressed in diverse ways over the past two decades. Several generic eye gaze use-cases are identified: desktop, TV, head-mounted, automotive, and handheld devices. Analysis of the literature leads to the identification of several platform specific factors that influence gaze tracking accuracy. A key outcome from this review is the realization of a need to develop standardized methodologies for the performance evaluation of gaze tracking systems and achieve consistency in their specification and comparative evaluation. To address this need, the concept of a methodological framework for practical evaluation of different gaze tracking systems is proposed.", "The extended range electric vehicle (EREV) can store much clean energy from the electric grid when it arrives at the charging station with lower battery energy. Consuming minimum gasoline during the trip is a common goal for most energy management controllers. To achieve these objectives, an intelligent energy management controller for EREV based on dynamic programming and neural networks (IEMC_NN) is proposed. The power demand split ratio between the extender and battery are optimized by DP, and the control objectives are presented as a cost function. The online controller is trained by neural networks. Three trained controllers, constructing the controller library in IEMC_NN, are obtained from training three typical lengths of the driving cycle. To determine an appropriate NN controller for different driving distance purposes, the selection module in IEMC_NN is developed based on the remaining battery energy and the driving distance to the charging station. Three simulation conditions are adopted to validate the performance of IEMC_NN. They are target driving distance information, known and unknown, changing the destination during the trip. Simulation results using these simulation conditions show that the IEMC_NN had better fuel economy than the charging deplete/charging sustain (CD/CS) algorithm. More significantly, with known driving distance information, the battery SOC controlled by IEMC_NN can just reach the lower bound as the EREV arrives at the charging station, which was also feasible when the driver changed the destination during the trip.", "The novelty of the Internet of Things (IoT) as a trend has not given society sufficient time to establish a clear view of what IoT is and how it operates. As such, people are likely to be unaware of the privacy implications, thus creating a gap between the belief of what a device does and its actual behaviour. The responses collected in our online survey indicate that participants tend to see IoT as computer -like devices, rather than appliances, though there are some important misconceptions about the way these devices function. We also find that privacy is a primary concern when it comes to IoT adoption. Nevertheless, participants have a propensity to keep using IoT devices even after they find out that the device abuses their trust. Finally, we provide recommendations to IoT vendors, to make their products more transparent in terms of privacy.", "This research project explores to what extent the utilization of open-source 3D printers and 3D design software could serve as means of learning and communication. The principles of non-formal education aligned with the concept of constructionism are used to create an experimental educational scenario focused on geocultural tourism for persons with visual impairments. This paper documents our experience and presents our findings- from a 25-day long project, which took place in Zagori, northwestern Greece. 11 high school students from Portugal designed and manufactured natural and cultural heritage artifacts carrying messages in the Braille language. The objects were then handed to people with visual impairments with a twofold aim. First, to enable the communication among persons with and without visual impairments; and, second, to empower students to participate in training projects through open educational procedures. We conclude that open educational practices can boost students' active engagement in educational processes. Finally, 3D printing encourages a meaningful communication among people with and without visual impairments via the tangible exploration of geocultural components. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In response, a rapidly expanding, array of collaborative geospatial tools is being developed to help collaborators share data, code, and results. Successful navigation of these tools requires users to understand their strengths, synergies, and weaknesses. In this paper, we identify the key components of a collaborative Spatial Data Science workflow to develop a framework for evaluating the various functional aspects of collaborative geospatial tools. Using this framework, we then score thirty-one existing collaborative geospatial tools and apply a cluster analysis to create a typology of these tools. We present this typology as a map of the emergent ecosystem and functional niches of collaborative geospatial tools. We identify three primary clusters of tools composed of eight secondary clusters across which divergence is driven by required infrastructure and user involvement. Overall, our results highlight how environmental collaborations have benefitted from the use of these tools and propose key areas of future tool development for continued support of collaborative geospatial efforts.

In the context of the Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment, a versatile small form factor Timing and Fast-Control (TFC) interfacing FPGA Mezzanine Card (FMC) was developed, offering bidirectional twisted-pair (TP) links for the communication between TFC nodes. Also a versatile clocking including voltage controlled oscillators and a connection to the telecommunication clock lines of mTCA crates are available. Being designed for both TFC Master and Slaves, the card allows rapid system developments without additional Slave hardware circuits. Measurements show that it is possible to transmit over cable lengths of 25m at a rate of 240 Mbit/s for all data channels simultaneously. A TFC Master-Slave system using two of these cards can be synchronized with a precision of +/- 10 ps to an user-defined phase setpoint.", "This paper investigates four case studies of wearables laboratory production and their relationship to performativity. By investigating the epistemic cultures of technological innovation and design within the field of techno fashion, the paper aims to prove that performance is a seminal driving force in the creation and use of wearable devices and fashion-tech designs.", "Surveillance screening at scale to identify people infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) prior to extensive transmission is key to bringing an end to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, even though vaccinations have already begun. Here we describe Corona Detective, a sensitive and rapid molecular test to detect the virus, based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification, which could be applied anywhere at low cost. Critically, the method uses freeze-dried reagents, readily shipped without cold-chain dependence. The reaction detects the viral nucleocapsid gene through a sequence-specific quenched-fluorescence readout, which avoids false positives and also allows multiplex detection with an internal control cellular RNA. Corona Detective can be used in 8-tube strips to be read with a simple open-design fluorescence detector. Other methods to use and produce Corona Detective locally in a variety of formats are possible and already openly shared. Detection specificity is ensured through inclusion of positive and negative control reactions to run in parallel with the diagnostic reactions. A simple user protocol, including sample preparation, and a bioinformatics pipeline to ensure that viral variants will still be detectable with SARS-CoV-2 primer sets complete the method. Through rapid production and distribution of Corona Detective reactions, quite inexpensive at scale, daily or weekly surveillance testing of large populations, without waiting for symptoms to develop, is anticipated, in combination with vaccination campaigns, to finally control this pandemic.", "Non-residential buildings contribute to around 20% of the total energy consumed in Europe. This consumption continues to increase globally. Smart building proposals (focused on Nearly Zero Energy Building (NZEB), air quality monitoring, energy saving with thermal comfort, etc.) were already necessary before 2020, and the pandemic has made this research and development area more essential. Furthermore, the need to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and obtain technological solutions based on the Internet of Things (IoT) requires holistic contributions through real installations that serve as spaces for measuring, testing, study and research. This article proposes a \"measure-analyse-decide and act\" methodology to quantify the Smart Readiness Indicator (SRI) for university buildings as a reference environment for energy efficiency and COVID-19 prevention models. Two conceptual spaces (physical and digital) within two dimensions (users and infrastructures) are designated over an IoT three-level model (information acquisition, interoperable communication, and data-driven decision). An IoT ecosystem (sensoriZAR) was implemented as a proof-of-concept of a smart campus at the University of Zaragoza, Spain. Focused on CO2 and energy consumption monitoring, the results showed effectiveness through real installations, demonstrating the IoT potential as SDG-enabling technologies. These contributions allow not only experimental lab tests (from the authors' expertise in several specialties of Industrial, Mechanical, Design, Thermal, Electrical, Electronic, Computer and Telecommunication Engineering) but also a reference model for direct application in academic works, research projects and institutional initiatives, extendable to professional environments, buildings and cities.", "Intelligent perception is the cornerstone of digitalisation of power grid. Due to the closest connection with users, the information perception ability of distribution network directly affects the reliability of power supply. Distribution network has a wide range of geographical distribution and equipment types. The application of intelligent perception is with high complexity and dynamics under the limitation of both technology and management. Therefore, the study first sorts out the current application status of intelligent perception technology and equipment in distribution network from three application fields including distribution automation, metering systems, and inspection. Then, the constraints of existing intelligent perception applications and the key points of further research are pointed out. Finally, the development trends of intelligent perception technology in distribution network are presented from the three aspects of basic technology, perception equipment, and advanced applications. With the improvement of sensing, communication, energy acquisition, chips and perception equipments, the depth and breadth of advanced applications in distribution network will be expanded. The research results can provide references for the follow-up research and practice of intelligent perception in distribution networks.", "This paper proposes a novel identity management framework for Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing-based personalized healthcare systems. The proposed framework uses multimodal encrypted biometric traits to perform authentication. It employs a combination of centralized and federated identity access techniques along with biometric based continuous authentication. The framework uses a fusion of electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals when performing authentication. In addition to relying on the unique identification characteristics of the users' biometric traits, the security of the framework is empowered by the use of Homomorphic Encryption (HE). The use of HE allows patients' data to stay encrypted when being processed or analyzed in the cloud. Thus, providing not only a fast and reliable authentication mechanism, but also closing the door to many traditional security attacks. The framework's performance was evaluated and validated using a machine learning (ML) model that tested the framework using a dataset of 25 users in seating positions. Compared to using just ECG or PPG signals, the results of using the proposed fused-based biometric framework showed that it was successful in identifying and authenticating all 25 users with 100% accuracy. Hence, offering some significant improvements to the overall security and privacy of personalized healthcare systems.", "Makerspaces have spread to schools, museums, and libraries around the world. These are spaces that make technology construction more accessible and afford practices that situate makers as everyday designers. In this paper, the connection between makerspaces and makers' everyday lives is examined. For this study, thirteen makers were interviewed about the process of their everyday maker projects, and the data material was analyzed for practices, reflections on agency, and relations to places like the makerspace, the home, and beyond. Three distinct practices have been discovered and are described. Crafting is an individual, recreative, skillful, and immersive practice that connects to an individual workspace aside from the makerspace. Connecting is a crea-tive, object-oriented, and interventionist practice that connects to everyday life situations open for inventions. Commoning is a social and communal practice that connects to the makerspace community. The makers' practices inform a discussion of the agency the makerspace enables, and the spatial practices that both enable and constrain actions. Also, because makerspaces are places that intend to make technology construction accessible and inclusive, diversity in maker communities, barriers to inclusion, and strategies to overcome these are discussed.", "An instruction set architecture (ISA) is a core around which the rest of a CPU is built. Errors or inflexible solutions once embedded in an instruction set remain with a corresponding generation of processors forever. Hence, one of the key reasons why the growth in the performance of modern CPUs slowed down is that the source code of processors \"got corrupted\" literally and figuratively: processors become more complex, which makes their further development more difficult. In any case, the development of modern computers (CPUs, GPUs, or specialized systems) is an extremely expensive process, which involves a large number of expensive stages. Therefore, the overall cost of CPU development is a key issue. In this paper, we investigate popular instruction set architectures, as well as make some conclusions about the prospects of RISC-V and other open-source architectures. We try to answer the following questions. Why an instruction set architecture is really important? Why RISC-V is better than the other architectures? Which opportunities does RISC-V open for developers around the world and what competitors does it have?", "The outbreak of COVID-19 is a public health emergency that caused disastrous results in many countries. The global aim is to stop transmission and prevent the spread of the disease. To achieve it, every country needs to scale up emergency response mechanisms, educate and actively communicate with the public, intensify infected case finding, contact tracing, monitoring, quarantine of contacts, and isolation of cases. Responding to an emergency requires efficient collaboration and a multi-skilled approach (medical, information, statistical, political, social, and other expertise), which makes it hard to define one interface for all. As actors from different perspectives and domain backgrounds need to address diverse functions, the possibility to exchange available information quickly would be desirable. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, a joint state-level public health institution has not been established, but is covered by entity competencies. In this sense, a geoportal has been developed as an epidemiological location-intelligence system (ELIS) that supports the exchange of such information between the entities and the cantons. For its development, open source software components in the cloud were used as a working platform with all the necessary functionalities. The geoportal provides an entry point for access to geospatial, epidemiological, environmental and statistical data used for analysis, geocoding of confirmed COVID-19 cases, identification of disease dynamics, identification of vulnerable groups, mapping of health capacities, and general modeling of infection spread with application support for communication and collaboration between all institutions and the public. The paper describes the challenges and ways to overcome them in the development and use of ELIS.", "Lightweight UAVs equipped with deep learning models have become a trend, which can be deployed for automatic navigation in a wide range of civilian and military missions. However, real-time applications usually need to process a large amount of image data, which leads to a very large computational complexity and storage consumption, and restricts its deployment on resource-constrained embedded edge devices. To reduce the computing requirements and storage occupancy of the neural network model, we proposed the ensemble binarized DroNet (EBDN) model, which implemented the reconstructed DroNet with the binarized and ensemble learning method, so that the model size of DroNet was effectively compressed, and ensemble learning method was used to overcome the defect of the poor performance of the low-precision network. Compared to the original DroNet, EBDN saves more than 7 times of memory footprint with similar model accuracy. Meanwhile, we also proposed a novel and high-efficiency hardware architecture to realize the EBDN on the chip (EBDNoC) system, which perfectly realizes the mapping of an algorithm model to hardware architecture. Compared to other solutions, the proposed architecture achieves about 10.21 GOP/s/kLUTs resource efficiency and 208.1 GOP/s/W energy efficiency, while also providing a good trade-off between model performance and resource utilization.", ["Ly et al. report a multi-well imaging system (the Picroscope) that can perform longitudinal bright-field z-stack imaging for 24 wells simultaneously. They demonstrate its capability by imaging zebrafish embryos, planaria worms, development of Xenopus tropicalis over a 28-h period and embryonic stem cell monolayer and organoids inside an incubator.", "Simultaneous longitudinal imaging across multiple conditions and replicates has been crucial for scientific studies aiming to understand biological processes and disease. Yet, imaging systems capable of accomplishing these tasks are economically unattainable for most academic and teaching laboratories around the world. Here, we propose the Picroscope, which is the first low-cost system for simultaneous longitudinal biological imaging made primarily using off-the-shelf and 3D-printed materials. The Picroscope is compatible with standard 24-well cell culture plates and captures 3D z-stack image data. The Picroscope can be controlled remotely, allowing for automatic imaging with minimal intervention from the investigator. Here, we use this system in a range of applications. We gathered longitudinal whole organism image data for frogs, zebrafish, and planaria worms. We also gathered image data inside an incubator to observe 2D monolayers and 3D mammalian tissue culture models. Using this tool, we can measure the behavior of entire organisms or individual cells over long-time periods."], "This paper describes how to implement a low-cost didactic platform designed to teach or reinforce discrete control theory concepts. The controllers used in this work (P, PI, PD, and PID) are suitable for undergraduate students but the same platform could be used to explain and test advanced controllers to graduate students. This document shows, step by step, how to control a DC motor speed and position, along with the most common problems and its solutions, commonly overlooked in the literature. It also explains how to simulate the system behavior and compares the simulations with the real data, showing an average correlation coefficient of rho=0.983. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

Devising new policies to boost Africa's neuroscience landscape is imperative, but these must be based on accurate data on research outputs which is largely lacking. Such data must reflect the heterogeneity of research environments across the continent's 54 countries. Here, we analyse neuroscience publications affiliated with African institutions between 1996 and 2017. Of 12,326 PubMed indexed publications, 5,219 show clear evidence that the work was performed in Africa and led by African-based researchers - on average similar to 5 per country and year. From here, we extract information on journals and citations, funding, international coauthorships and techniques used. For reference, we also extract the same metrics from 220 randomly selected publications each from the UK, USA, Australia, Japan and Brazil. Our dataset provides insights into the current state of African neuroscience research in a global context. Here, the authors survey neuroscience publications from Africa over the past two decades, highlighting areas of active research, international networks, funding, and techniques used.", "Location-Based Services (LBS) are part of our day-to-day life, assisting in a variety of tasks such as tracing better routes to a destination, traffic verification and even for safety applications such as car or people tracking. However, it may not possible visually to identify some activities like attempted theft or kidnapping in the same way that a surveillance camera with visual information. It was identified that the integration of these two information (Global Position and Video) could improve surveillance systems from a security perspective. IP cameras are common examples of multimedia sensors that have become an increasingly popular and ubiquitously installed item in urban centers applied to security. This paper proposes a location-based architecture for video stream selection that can be used to monitor entities (people or not) in a context of Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT) through a representational model of coverage areas of IP cameras. A prototype was implemented as a proof of concept of the proposed architecture. This prototype includes a low latency video transmission service to quickly start a video transmission only when an entity is inside a visual field of view. Tests were performed on the Internet to check for video delivery latency, bandwidth consumption, and the results suggest the effectiveness of the proposal.", "Personalization of shoes is of increasing importance to designers, researchers, shoemakers and manufacturers as mass customization progresses towards ultra-personalized product service systems. Many attempts have been made to design co-creation platforms that allow end users to personalize their own shoes. concentrating on color preference. This research takes a different approach by designing a toolkit for maker-oriented users to co-manufacture their own shoes. The toolkit was deployed worldwide to different users via crowdsharing. Backers (n=237) were surveyed before deployment and thirty users were interviewed after two years to understand personalization over a full cycle of making and use with the crafted research product. We found that users who have higher quality tools and materials in their toolkits are more likely to personalize their shoes while co-manufacturing. The research provides insights for researchers and designers creating toolkits for designing personalization product service systems/configurators and engaging in tangible bespoke processes.", "This letter introduces a new aerial insect-sized robot weighing 143 mg-slightly more than a honeybee-actuated by four perpendicular wings splayed outward. This arrangement gives the robot more capabilities than previous two-winged designs. These include the ability to actuate around a vertical axis (steering), and enough payload capacity (>260 mg) to carry components such as sensor packages or power systems. To validate the design, the author demonstrated steering actuation in flight, as well as hovering position control using motion capture feedback. Analysis and preliminary experiment additionally suggests that the robot may be passively stable in attitude. The letter concludes by proposing a minimal set of components the robot would need to carry to achieve either sensor-autonomous flight, or power autonomous flight powered by supercapacitors. In both cases, earlier two-winged designs do not have enough lift. This robot therefore represents a mechanical platform that is well-suited to future sensor- and power-autonomous insect robots.", "Impacts from natural and anthropogenic coastal hazards are substantial and increasing significantly with climate change. Coasts and coastal communities are increasingly at risk. In addition to short-term events, long-term changes, including rising sea levels, increasing storm intensity, and consequent severe compound flooding events are degrading coastal ecosystems and threatening coastal dwellers. Consequently, people living near the coast require environmental intelligence in the form of reliable short-term and long-term predictions in order to anticipate, prepare for, adapt to, resist, and recover from hazards. Risk-informed decision making is crucial, but for the resulting information to be actionable, it must be effectively and promptly communicated to planners, decision makers and emergency managers in readily understood terms and formats. The information, critical to forecasts of extreme weather and flooding, as well as long-term projections of future risks, must involve synergistic interplay between observations and models. In addition to serving data for assimilation into models, the observations are also essential for objective validation of models via hind casts. Linked observing and modeling programs that involve stakeholder input and integrate engineering, environmental, and community vulnerability are needed to evaluate conditions prior to and following severe storm events, to update baselines, and to plan for future changes over the long term. In contrast to most deep-sea phenomena, coastal vulnerabilities are locally and regionally specific and prioritization of the most important observational data and model predictions must rely heavily on input from local and regional communities and decision makers. Innovative technologies and nature-based solutions are already helping to reduce vulnerability from coastal hazards in some localities but more focus on local circumstances, as opposed to global solutions, is needed. Agile and spatially distributed response capabilities will assist operational organizations in predicting, preparing for and mitigating potential community-wide disasters. This white paper outlines the rationale, synthesizes recent literature and summarizes some data-driven approaches to coastal resilience.", "Precision and personalized medicine will be increasingly based on the integration of various type of information, particularly electronic health records and genome sequences. The availability of cheap genome sequencing services and the information interoperability will increase the role of online bioinformatics analysis. Being on the Internet poses constant threats to security and privacy. While we are connected and we share information, websites and internet services collect various types of personal data with or without the user consent. It is likely that genomics will merge with the internet culture of connectivity. This process will increase incidental findings, exposure and vulnerability. Here we discuss the social vulnerability owing to the genome and Internet combined security and privacy weaknesses. This urges more efforts in education and social awareness on how biomedical data are analysed and transferred through the internet and how inferential methods could integrate information from different sources. We propose that digital social platforms, used for raising collective awareness in different fields, could be developed for collaborative and bottom-up efforts in education. In this context, bioinformaticians could play a meaningful role in mitigating the future risk of digital-genomic divide.", "Implantable neuronal interfaces to the brain are an important keystone for future medical applications. However, entering this field of research is difficult since such an implant requires components from many different areas of technology. Since the complete avoidance of wires is important due to the risk of infections and other long-term problems, means for wirelessly transmitting data and energy are a necessity which adds to the requirements. In recent literature, many high-tech components for such implants are presented with remarkable properties. However, these components are typically not freely available for such a system. Every group needs to re-develop their own solution. This raises the question if it is possible to create a reusable design for an implant and its external base-station, such that it allows other groups to use it as a starting point. In this article, we try to answer this question by presenting a design based exclusively on commercial off-the-shelf components and studying the properties of the resulting system. Following this idea, we present a fully wireless neuronal implant for simultaneously measuring electrocorticography signals at 128 locations from the surface of the brain. All design files are available as open source.", "Colocated 4x4 multiple-input multiple-output measurements at 2.55 and 24 GHz are presented for two university buildings consisting of classrooms and offices. Link gain in hallways and connected laboratories looks similar at the two frequencies when the effect of lower effective receive antenna aperture with increasing frequency is removed. Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation through a wall or around hallway corners exhibits approximately 5-20 dB (11 dB on average) greater loss beyond the 20 dB aperture loss at 24 GHz compared to that at 2.55 GHz. Fixed directional antennas increase path loss (PL) by an average of 13 dB when misaligned. Capacity for normalized signal-to-noise ratio is very similar in the two bands and is close to that for the optimal independent identically distributed case, indicating sufficient multipath for spatial multiplexing at 24 GHz. A ray-tracing study suggests that material loss must increase from 2.55 to 24 GHz to correctly predict the higher PL at 24 GHz in severely obstructed scenarios, indicating a need for future material characterization in high microwave bands. The results suggest that 24 GHz is a viable option to replace medium-range (10-30 m) NLOS wireless services currently operating at 2.4 GHz.", "The target of rapamycin (TOR) is a eukaryotic serine/threonine protein kinase that functions in two distinct complexes, TORC1 and TORC2, to regulate growth and metabolism(1,2). GTPases, responding to signals generated by abiotic stressors, nutrients, and, in metazoans, growth factors, play an important(3) but poorly understood role in TORC1 regulation. Here we report that, in budding yeast, glucose withdrawal (which leads to an acute loss of TORC1 kinase activity(4)) triggers a similarly rapid Rag GTPase-dependent redistribution of TORC1 from being semi-uniform around the vacuolar membrane to a single, vacuole-associated cylindrical structure visible by super-resolution optical microscopy. Three-dimensional reconstructions of cryo-electron micrograph images of these purified cylinders demonstrate that TORC1 oligomerizes into a higher-level hollow helical assembly, which we name a TOROID (TORC1 organized in inhibited domain). Fitting of the recently described mammalian TORC1 structure into our helical map reveals that oligomerization leads to steric occlusion of the active site. Guided by the implications from our reconstruction, we present a TOR1 allele that prevents both TOROID formation and TORC1 inactivation in response to glucose withdrawal, demonstrating that oligomerization is necessary for TORC1 inactivation. Our results reveal a novel mechanism by which Rag GTPases regulate TORC1 activity and suggest that the reversible assembly and/or disassembly of higher-level structures may be an underappreciated mechanism for the regulation of protein kinases.", "Neuroscience research in Africa remains sparse.

While implementing the Smart Cities initiative, these data are integrated and utilized together with the 3D city model for further applications. Based on Open Geospatial Consortium standards, heterogeneous sensor data can be integrated with the Open Geospatial Consortium SensorThings Application Programming Interface. Similarly, the 3D city model data can be stored and exchanged with the Open Geospatial Consortium CityGML format. However, currently, there is no concrete model to integrate these sensor data with the 3D city model using the Open Geospatial Consortium standards. The existing solution for integrating the sensor data into the 3D city model requires an extension or plug-in for adding the data to the CityGML model. In this paper, we introduce the concept of \"CityThings\" to integrate dynamic sensor data from the Open Geospatial Consortium SensorThings API into the CityGML 3D city models. We demonstrate the implementation of the CityThings concept in the Smart Villages project in the study area of Wustenrot, Germany, by integrating dynamic sensor data from several systems including solar panels, agro-thermal plants, and weather monitoring sensors to visualize the sensor data with the 3D city model on the web platform. In the future, this concept can be applied to interconnect dynamic sensor data and 3D city model data in other Smart Cities applications.", "This paper will present the application of the Controller Area Network (CAN) for communication between the Motor Control Processor and the Europa Lander Motor Control Cards. The Europa Lander preproject team is concerned about lowering the estimated mass, volume, and power of the mission concept so that it could maximize its science return. The motor controller uses multiple Motor Control Cards to control the 24 motors that will be operating in the extremes of the Europa environment. The CAN bus was considered because of its multi-drop nature, low power interface, and simple communication protocol. Beyond communication with the motor controller cards we also use the CAN bus interface to gather telemetry from the Power Conversion Card. Our system requires the collection of telemetry at a rate of 64Hz from the Power Conversion Card and all active motor controllers along with the sending of control packets and the receipt of control parameters at 512 Hz. In the paper we will address the ability of the CAN bus to meet these requirements along with our Arduino based test system used to learn about the CAN bus standard and verify our analysis.", "The rapid development and widespread use of information and telecommunication technologies do not mitigate, in many situations, information exclusion, nor the physical isolation of people-mainly that of the elderly living in remote locations, whose mobile network coverage is deficient or non-existent, preventing them from accessing health care, be it routine follow-up procedures or emergencies. Addressing this, we raise the question that guides our study: how can we monitor the elderly's residence and health conditions, detect falls, and track their movement in the vicinity of their homes in a non-intrusive manner? To answer this question, we present a system prototype that uses affordable, low-cost, and low-energy equipment with media and data processing, supported by LoRa (Long Range) and ESP32 microcontrollers, coupling several sensors. As a result, it is possible to monitor sensors that predict and detect falls or other risk events for the user, e.g., fire, with authorized persons and entities, family members, civil protection, and security forces accessing the gathered data, assuring their security. We conclude that the system could decisively improve people's quality of life, particularly those of the elderly who live in remote places with greater vulnerability.", "Tremendous research, policy, and investment is directed towards a new wave of automation in modern societies. Most notable within discourse for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, but also in radical ideas for Fully Automated Luxury Communism, automation appears essential to the future. Advocates claim it will renew capital accumulation, boost labour productivity, and extend managerial control in sustainable systems of production and consumption. Noting criticism about future essentialism in this automation advocacy, this essay will turn to innovations in marginal industrious spaces within industrial societies. Here people are hacking, subverting and appropriating ostensibly automating technologies for purposes of creativity, collaboration, and care. Social capabilities in post-automation are being cultivated. Perhaps greater attention to the politics implied in post-automation can help open our futures to more democratic deliberation?", "Plastic pollution, especially in marine environments, is a global problem that is currently inadequately managed. Solutions for marine plastic can occur through policy, behavior change and infrastructure improvements, but also through entrepreneurial ventures and technological innovations. Currently, information about these ventures and innovations is scattered and lacks coherence. This study presents the first comprehensive overview of entrepreneurial and SME led solutions for marine plastic by analyzing a database of 105 SMEs categorized into four functions: prevention, collection, transformation and monitoring. We find that small businesses are successfully commercializing goods and services to reduce the damage of plastics on the marine environment through innovative business models, with a steep growth of startups founded between 2016 and 2019. However, efforts to manage marine plastic are still underdeveloped in many areas, including microplastic management and monitoring. Practitioners, policymakers and researchers can utilize the database to identify solutions, best practices, synergies and avenues for further research, such as quantifying the environmental impacts of this industry.", "During the COVID-19 pandemic, global health services have faced unprecedented demands. Many key workers in health and social care have experienced crippling shortages of personal protective equipment, and clinical engineers in hospitals have been severely stretched due to insufficient supplies of medical devices and equipment. Many engineers who normally work in other sectors have been redeployed to address the crisis, and they have rapidly improvised solutions to some of the challenges that emerged, using a combination of low-tech and cutting-edge methods. Much publicity has been given to efforts to design new ventilator systems and the production of 3D-printed face shields, but many other devices and systems have been developed or explored. This paper presents a description of efforts to reverse engineer or redesign critical parts, specifically a manifold for an anaesthesia station, a leak port, plasticware for COVID-19 testing, and a syringe pump lock box. The insights obtained from these projects were used to develop a product lifecycle management system based on Aras Innovator, which could with further work be deployed to facilitate future rapid response manufacturing of bespoke hardware for healthcare. The lessons learned could inform plans to exploit distributed manufacturing to secure back-up supply chains for future emergency situations. If applied generally, the concept of distributed manufacturing could give rise to \"21st century cottage industries\" or \"nanofactories,\" where high-tech goods are produced locally in small batches.", "The feasibility and desirability of endless economic growth is being increasingly questioned by scholars and activists. Whilst envisioning alternative economic models is key to assure the sustainability and wellbeing of present and future generations, few studies have analysed what might be the role of 'innovation' in a post-growth era. Innovating has become an imperative for the survival and expansion of any form of organisation. But this 'innovate or die mania' underpins assumptions - such as technological determinism and productivism - that neglect the socially constructed character of technological development, its politics and its capacity to enable (or disable) just and equitable societies. In this paper we posit that untangling innovation from growth is key to imagine a post-growth era. We show how alternative bottom up initiatives, promoted by a variety of different organizational forms, have challenged mainstream ideas about innovation and growth. These experiments provide a glimpse into what 'innovation without growth' could mean in terms of technology and social organization. We conclude by proposing new paths in research aimed at exploring under which conditions post-growth-oriented organizations can flourish and diffuse.", "Social networks provide individuals with diverse or redundant information depending on the network structure. Both types of information offer advantages for generating new ideas. At the same time, network structure and network content are independent. As a result, two individuals with the same network position can access diverse or redundant content from their social peers. In this study, we investigate the function of social networks in innovative endeavors given individuals' different kinds of information accessing behavior. In accordance with previous research, we argue that individuals with a broker status access more diverse information through nonredundant network structures and develop, on average, more novel ideas. We further propose that redundancy in content complements brokers' structural non-redundancy by providing familiar knowledge elements and therefore interpretability, while non-redundancy in both content and structure leads to information overload. Thus, we hypothesize that brokers accessing more information depth, and independently, less information breadth generate newer ideas. To test our hypotheses, we collected data from a popular online maker community containing 18,146 ideas, 19,919 profiles, and 52,663 comments. We used topic modeling (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to extract hidden knowledge elements and social network analysis to identify brokers. In line with our hypotheses, we find that information depth (breadth) strengthens (weakens) a favorable broker position. These findings have implications for the literature on idea generation in social networks and household sector innovation.", "Scenario: The particulate matter (PM) is associated with all particles (solid and liquid) suspended in the air. Depending on the kind and size of the particle, each one represents different kinds of risks for human health. The emerging of tiny, available, and accessible devices related to the Internet of Things (IoT) has allowed the implementation of different monitoring strategies. Objective: To identify and characterize the IoT-based real-time monitoring strategies that have implemented a measurement process to study the effect of the PM on human health. Methodology: A wide analysis based on the systematic mapping study was performed on September 4, 2020. The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), IEEE, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, Scopus, and Wiley databases were considered in the exploration. Results: 48 articles addressing the IoT-based PM measurement were obtained, falling them between 2010 and 2020 with growing interest. The main use of this technology is related to increase the coverage and density of environmental monitoring stations due to the impact of PM on human health. Also, approaches to monitoring air quality and their potential effects on people's affections are described. Conclusions: Collaborative, people-aware, global proposals tend to get increasing interest. Only six (12.5%) articles incorporated some recommendation system based on PM measures. The accuracy and precision are the main concern around low-cost sensors for measuring PM. Thus, the calibration process is highlighted in 64.44% of articles. The main challenges reside in a combination of uncertainties in PM measurement, health impacts, data quality, and the influence of environmental variables on all of them.", "To pursue a more mechanistic understanding of the neural control of behavior, many neuroethologists study animal behavior in controlled laboratory environments. One popular approach is to measure the movements of restrained animals while presenting controlled sensory stimulation. This approach is especially powerful when applied to genetic model organisms, such as Drosophila melanogaster, where modern genetic tools enable unprecedented access to the nervous system for activity monitoring or targeted manipulation. While there is a long history of measuring the behavior of body- and head-fixed insects walking on an air-supported ball, the methods typically require complex setups with many custom components. Here we present a compact, simplified setup for these experiments that achieves high-performance at low cost. The simplified setup integrates existing hardware and software solutions with new component designs. We replaced expensive optomechanical and custom machined components with off-the-shelf and 3D-printed parts, and built the system around a low-cost camera that achieves 180 Hz imaging and an inexpensive tablet computer to present view-angle-corrected stimuli updated through a local network. We quantify the performance of the integrated system and characterize the visually guided behavior of flies in response to a range of visual stimuli. In this paper, we thoroughly document the improved system; the accompanying repository incorporates CAD files, parts lists, source code, and detailed instructions. We detail a complete ~$300 system, including a cold-anesthesia tethering stage, that is ideal for hands-on teaching laboratories. This represents a nearly 50-fold cost reduction as compared to a typical system used in research laboratories, yet is fully featured and yields excellent performance. We report the current state of this system, which started with a 1-day teaching lab for which we built seven parallel setups and continues toward a setup in our lab for larger-scale analysis of visual-motor behavior in flies. Because of the simplicity, compactness, and low cost of this system, we believe that high-performance measurements of tethered insect behavior should now be widely accessible and suitable for integration into many systems. This access enables broad opportunities for comparative work across labs, species, and behavioral paradigms.", "With the implementation of the Internet of Things, the agricultural domain has become data-driven, allowing for well-timed and cost-effective farm management while remaining environmentally sustainable. Thus, the incorporation of Internet of Things in the agricultural domain is the need of the hour for developing countries whose gross domestic product primarily depends on the farming sector. It is worth highlighting that developing nations lack the infrastructure for precision agriculture; therefore, it has become necessary to come up with a methodological paradigm which can accommodate a complete model to connect ground sensors to the compute nodes in a cost-effective way by keeping the data processing limitations and constraints in consideration. In this regard, this review puts forward an overview of the state-of-the-art technologies deployed in precision agriculture for soil assessment and pollutant monitoring with respect to heavy metal in agricultural soil using various sensors. Secondly, this manuscript illustrates the processing of data generated from the sensors. In this regard, an optimized method of data processing derived from cloud computing has been shown, which is called edge computing. In addition to this, a new model of high-performance-based edge computing is also shown for efficient offloading of data with smooth workflow optimization. In a nutshell, this manuscript aims to open a new corridor for the farming sector in developing nations by tackling challenges and providing substantial consideration.", "Due to the small size of Micro Aerial Vehicles, they are well suited for various indoor applications, especially search/rescue operations. Most of these operations are performed in unknown 3D environments. Real-time map construction and vehicle's localization are essential tasks. Various approaches provide solutions for 3D-map representation. However, these approaches require expensive embedded systems to afford high-processing memory/computational costs. Because of its exposure to risks, the MAV should be equipped with a low-cost navigation system. The principal aim of map construction herein is to facilitate the navigation task. Thus, constructing a massive 3D map is not required. Consequently, this paper proposes an efficient real-time 3D SLAM. The proposed method avoids the 3D-map representation of each region of the trajectory. Alternatively, it divides the environment along the trajectory into several 2D maps with a single 2D map in every region at the height of the MAV, as well as a transient region between each of the two constructed maps to enable connecting neighboring maps.", "The problem of gas detection is relevant to many real-world applications, such as leak detection in industrial settings and landfill monitoring. In this paper, we address the problem of gas detection in large areas with a mobile robotic platform equipped with a remote gas sensor. We propose an algorithm that leverages a novel method based on convex relaxation for quickly solving sensor placement problems, and for generating an efficient exploration plan for the robot. To demonstrate the applicability of our method to real-world environments, we performed a large number of experimental trials, both on randomly generated maps and on the map of a real environment. Our approach proves to be highly efficient in terms of computational requirements and to provide nearly-optimal solutions.", "An ultra-low power CMOS image sensor with on-chip energy harvesting and power management capability is introduced in this paper. The photodiode pixel array can not only capture images but also harvest solar energy. As such, the CMOS image sensor chip is able to switch between imaging and harvesting modes towards self-power operation. Moreover, an on-chip maximum power point tracking (MPPT)-based power management system (PMS) is designed for the dual-mode image sensor to further improve the energy efficiency. A new isolated P-well energy harvesting and imaging (EHI) pixel with very high fill factor is introduced. Several ultra-low power design techniques such as reset and select boosting techniques have been utilized to maintain a wide pixel dynamic range. The chip was designed and fabricated in a 1.8 V, 1P6M 0.18 mu m CMOS process. Total power consumption of the imager is 6.53 mu W for a 96 x 96 pixel array with 1 V supply and 5 fps frame rate. Up to 30 W of power could be generated by the new EHI pixels. The PMS is capable of providing 3x the power required during imaging mode with 50% efficiency allowing energy autonomous operation with a 72.5% duty cycle.", "Distributed transmission rate tuning is important for a wide variety of IEEE 802.15.4 network applications such as industrial network control systems. Such systems often require each node to sustain certain throughput demand in order to guarantee the system performance. It is thus essential to determine a proper transmission rate that can meet the application requirement and compensate for network imperfections (e.g., packet loss). Such a tuning in a heterogeneous network is difficult due to the lack of modeling techniques that can deal with the heterogeneity of the network as well as the network traffic changes. In this paper, a distributed transmission rate tuning algorithm in a heterogeneous IEEE 802.15.4 CSMA/CA network is proposed. Each node uses the results of clear channel assessment (CCA) to estimate the busy channel probability. Then a mathematical framework is developed to estimate the on-going heterogeneous traffics using the busy channel probability at runtime. Finally a distributed algorithm is derived to tune the transmission rate of each node to accurately meet the throughput requirement. The algorithm does not require modifications on IEEE 802.15.4 MAC layer and it has been experimentally implemented and extensively tested using TelosB nodes with the TinyOS protocol stack. The results reveal that the algorithm is accurate and can satisfy the throughput demand. Compared with existing techniques, the algorithm is fully distributed and thus does not require any central coordination. With this property, it is able to adapt to traffic changes and re-adjust the transmission rate to the desired level, which cannot be achieved using the traditional modeling techniques.", "User interactions with the recent smartphones and tablets are visually rich but poor in the sense of touch and thus is not fully immersive. We propose HelloHapticWorld: a haptics educational kit which uses the variable friction of the TPad to virtually simulate the haptic sensation of tele-operated robot onto the fingertips of the user. The kit contains a mobile robot controlled by TPad and a reconfigurable field consisting of obstacles and road slopes of different sizes and shapes. The frequency and amplitude of the signals are modulated for representing slope and distance informations. Psychophysical analysis on 5 adult subjects for the signal excitation of haptic feedback were conducted using the method of constant stimuli based on which sinusoidal waveform rendering was selected for haptic slope and distance rendering. Methods of magnitude estimation and Confusion matrix analysis was further used to evaluate the linearity of haptic obstacle perception and discriminability of haptic slope perception respectively. The result shows 81.2% slope discrimination and 90% linear obstacle perception during robot teleoperation using HelloHapticWorld.", "Near-ground maneuvers, such as hover, approach, and landing, are key elements of autonomy in unmanned aerial vehicles. Such maneuvers have been tackled conventionally by measuring or estimating the velocity and the height above the ground, often using ultrasonic or laser range finders. Near-ground maneuvers are naturally mastered by flying birds and insects because objects below may be of interest for food or shelter. These animals perform such maneuvers efficiently using only the available vision and vestibular sensory information. In this paper, the time-to-contact (tau) theory, which conceptualizes the visual strategy with which many species are believed to approach objects, is presented as a solution for relative ground distance control for unmanned aerial vehicles. The paper shows how such an approach can be visually guided without knowledge of height and velocity relative to the ground. A control scheme that implements the tau strategy is developed employing only visual information from a monocular camera and an inertial measurement unit. To achieve reliable visual information at a high rate, a novel filtering system is proposed to complement the control system. The proposed system is implemented onboard an experimental quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle and is shown to not only successfully land and approach ground, but also to enable the user to choose the dynamic characteristics of the approach. The methods presented in this paper are applicable to both aerial and space autonomous vehicles.", "In this paper, a low-cost single-tilting tricopter aerial vehicle is developed with optical flow estimation for indoor navigation. A dynamic model is derived and experimental data is used to obtain the actuator constants. A CAD model is then developed and is used to obtain the moments of inertia with respect to the three main axes. A control allocation algorithm is also proposed to solve the problem of the number of control inputs being more than the number of actuators since the single rotor tilt tricopter has only four actuators (3 rotors and 1 servo). A cascaded-PID control scheme is then used to stabilize the tricopter in hover mode. The simulation results yield realistic control inputs and the outputs have acceptable performance. The feasibility of the proposed scheme is then validated with some experiments on the developed tricopter platform in hover.

Due to its unique physicochemical properties, biocompatibility, and biostability, there has been an increasing interest in the use of melanin for broad applications. In the vast majority of studies, melanin has been either chemically synthesized or isolated from animals, which has restricted its use to small-scale applications. Using bacteria as biocatalysts is a promising and economical alternative for the large-scale production of biomaterials. In this study, we engineered the marine bacterium Vibrio natriegens, one of the fastest-growing organisms, to synthesize melanin by expressing a heterologous tyrosinase gene and demonstrated that melanin production was much faster than in previously reported heterologous systems. The melanin of V. natriegens was characterized as a polymer derived from dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (DHICA) and, similarly to synthetic melanin, exhibited several characteristic and useful features. Electron microscopy analysis demonstrated that melanin produced from V. natriegens formed nanoparticles that were assembled as \"melanin ghost\" structures, and the photoprotective properties of these particles were validated by their protection of cells from UV irradiation. Using a novel electrochemical reverse engineering method, we observed that melanization conferred redox activity to V. natriegens. Moreover, melanized bacteria were able to quickly adsorb the organic compound trinitrotoluene (TNT). Overall, the genetic tractability, rapid division time, and ease of culture provide a set of attractive properties that compare favorably to current E. coli production strains and warrant the further development of this chassis as a microbial factory for natural product biosynthesis.", "IMPORTANCE Melanins are macromolecules that are ubiquitous in nature and impart a large variety of biological functions, including structure, coloration, radiation resistance, free radical scavenging, and thermoregulation. Currently, in the majority of investigations, melanins are either chemically synthesized or extracted from animals, which presents significant challenges for large-scale production. Bacteria have been used as biocatalysts to synthesize a variety of biomaterials due to their fast growth and amenability to genetic engineering using synthetic biology tools. In this study, we engineered the extremely fast-growing bacterium V. natriegens to synthesize melanin nanoparticles by expressing a heterologous tyrosinase gene with inducible promoters. Characterization of the melanin produced from V. natriegens-produced tyrosinase revealed that it exhibited physical and chemical properties similar to those of natural and chemically synthesized melanins, including nanoparticle structure, protection against UV damage, and adsorption of toxic compounds. We anticipate that producing and controlling melanin structures at the nanoscale in this bacterial system with synthetic biology tools will enable the design and rapid production of novel biomaterials for multiple applications."], "In this paper, we address the retrieval of spatially distributed latent heat flux (lambda E) over a tropical dry forest using multi-spectral and thermal unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery. The study was carried out in the Santa Rosa National Park Environmental Monitoring Super-Site, Costa Rica, in June 2016. The triangle method was used to derive lambda E from the UAV imagery and the results were compared to lambda E measurements of an eddy covariance system within the coincident eddy flux tower footprint. The tower footprint was derived using a two-dimensional parameterization model for flux footprint prediction. The comparisons with the flux tower measurements showed a mean relative difference of 10.98% with a slight overestimation of the UAV-based flux retrievals by nearly 7.7 W m(-2). The results are in good agreement with satellite-based retrievals, as provided by the literature, for which the triangle method was initially developed and mostly used so far. This study proved to be a promising approach for transferring the triangle method to UAV imagery in ecosystems such as tropical dry forests. With the presented approach, new details in spatially distributed latent heat flux estimates at ultra-high resolution are now possible, thereby potentially closing the gap in spatial resolution between satellites and flux towers. Even more, it allows tracing the latent heat flux from single trees at leaf level. Besides, this approach also opens new perspectives for the monitoring of latent heat fluxes in tropical dry forests.", "The demand for freshwater is on the increase due to the rapid growth in the world's population while the effect of global warming and climate change cause severe threat to water use and food security. Consequently, irrigation systems are tremendously utilized by many farmers all over the world with its associated high amount of water consumption from various sources posing a major concern. This necessitates the increased focus on improving the efficiency of water usage in irrigation agriculture. The advent and rapid successes of the Internet of Things (IoT) and advanced control strategies are being leveraged to achieve improved monitoring and control of irrigation farming. In this review, a thorough search for literature on irrigation monitoring and advanced control systems highlighting the research works within the past ten years are presented.

It is expected that this review paper will serve as a useful reference to enhance reader's knowledge on monitoring and advanced control opportunities related to irrigation agriculture as well as assist researchers in identifying directions and gaps to future research works in this field.", "Background In an accelerator-driven sub-critical system (ADS), a strong proton beam from a high-power proton accelerator irradiates a spallation target to produce very intense neutrons for driving a reactor. Currently, the China ADS front-end demo linac (CAFe) facility is being built to provide strong beam with the beam intensity of several mAs. Purpose This paper reports the machine protection system (MPS) of the CAFe facility, which prevents or minimizes the beam-induced damages or the damages from other sources to the machines in the accelerator. Method The MPS of CAFe facility works under the framework of experimental physics and industrial control system (EPICS). The developed machine protection system includes fast protection function and slow interlock function, where the fast function is performed by FPGA controller and the slow function is performed by PLC controller. Results Based on the reports on the status of all relevant subsystems, MPS will either perform an emergency shutdown of the beam or machine or will permit normal operation. When an emergency shutdown of the beam is needed, MPS switches off the ion source or switches on the chopper. In addition to its protective role, MPS will also trace the origin of an emergency shutdown. Conclusions The developed MPS has played an important role during the commissioning and successful operation of the CAFe facility at the end of 2019.", "The undeniable presence of microplastics (MPs) in soil, air and, especially, in the aquatic environment has revealed them to be an emerging pollutant. One of the main sources contributing to the release of these microplastics into the environment is wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). During the treatment of wastewater, these microparticles undergo incomplete retention, which leads to their discharge in huge amounts into water masses. The microplastics removed from the wastewater during the treatment processes usually become entrained in the sewage sludge, which is commonly employed as organic fertilizer. Alarming data regarding the occurrence of MPs in nature and the increasing public awareness of environmental concerns have led to the appearance of numerous studies on this topic in recent years. So, this work is focused on providing an overview of available processes for the removal of microplastics from water and also from sediments. Social demand for the correct and effective management of microplastics is constantly increasing and should be given careful consideration before future action is taken. Recycling is a good option, and policies might be developed in this direction, moving towards a circular and sustainable economy for plastics. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

We have evaluated positioning based on ultrawideband (UWB) ranging with our self-driving model car using a highly automated approach. Random drivable trajectories were generated, while the UWB position was compared against the Real-Time Kinematic Satellite Navigation (RTK-SN) positioning system which our model car also is equipped with. Fault injection was used to study the fault tolerance of the UWB positioning system. Addressed challenges are automatically generating test cases for real-time hardware, restoring the state between tests, and maintaining safety by preventing collisions. We were able to automatically generate and carry out hundreds of experiments on the model car in real time and rerun them consistently with and without fault injection enabled. Thereby, we demonstrate one novel approach to perform automated testing on complex real-time hardware.", "The IoT is the upcoming one of the major networking technologies. Using the IoT, different items or devices can be allowed to continuously generate, obtain, and exchange information. Different IoT applications nowadays are centered on computerizing various errands and are attempting to engage the inanimate physical items to act without direct supervision of a human. The current and forthcoming IoT services are exceptionally encouraging to build the degree of solace, proficiency, and automation for the clients. To obtain the option to actualize such a world in a continuously developing manner requires high security, protection, verification, and recuperation from assaults. Right now, incorporating the requisite changes in IoT systems engineering to achieve end-to-end, stable IoT infrastructure is paramount. In this research, a comprehensive analysis is incorporated into the security-relevant problems and threat wellsprings in IoT resources or applications.

Four distinct developments are investigated, including cryptography, fog computing, edge computing, and ML (Machine Learning), to extend the degree of IoT security.", "Evaluation of UAV systems is mostly based on simulation tools that are manually configured to define the trajectory (ground truth trajectory) for comparing with the system output. In this work, the authors present an original method to evaluate the performance of UAV platform in real situations without considering simulations. The proposed evaluation methodology allows calculating the system accuracy and robustness with a considerable number of samples, accumulating the performance of different missions in the same conditions. The main innovation is an alternative evaluation for designing sensor fusion parameters using real performance indicators of navigation accuracy in UAVs based on a commercially available flight controller and peripherals. This methodology and selected performance indicators allow to select the best parameters for the fusion system of a determined configuration of sensors and a predefined real mission not requiring ground truth. The selected platform is described highlighting the available sensors and data processing software, and the experimental methodology is proposed to characterize the sensor data fusion output. The results show in detail the presented performance metrics for a set of trajectories in order to determine the best choice of parameters using quality measurements of navigation output.", "This paper presents a feasibility study on how to implement power quality (PQ) metrics in a low-cost smart metering platform. The study is aimed at verifying the possibility of implementing PQ monitoring in distribution networks without replacing existing smart metering devices or adding new modules for PQ measurements, thus zeroing the installation costs. To this aim, an electronic board, currently used for remote energy metering, was chosen as a case study, specifically the STCOMET platform. Starting from the specifications of this device, the possibility of implementing power quality metrics is investigated in order to verify if compliance with standard requirements for PQ instruments can be obtained. Issues related to device features constraints are discussed; possible solutions and correction algorithms are presented and experimentally verified for different PQ metrics with a particular focus on harmonic analysis. The feasibility study takes into account both the use of on-board voltage and current transducers for low voltage applications and also the impact of external instrument transformers on measurement results.", "This paper presents a non-invasive method of classifying a subject's health into either one of two classes depending on the condition of the subjects' cardiovascular health. Novelty of the work lies in segregating the subjects who had good cardiovascular health and the subjects who were at risk. In the proposed work, VPG signals and other general information such as weight, height, BP were collected from 38 individuals in the post-adolescent age group. Furthermore, a signal from a person who was known to have good cardio vascular health was collected. This signal became the reference that was used to compare with other signals. After the initial pre-processing, the PPG and APG were obtained from the VPG. Then a total of 7 features of the wave contour from the APG and PPG signals were extracted. Based on the Augmentation Index the signals were classified into two classes using SVM and ELM classifiers. Where one class represented healthy individuals and the other class represents the individuals at risk of CVD. The average values of the extracted features were used and the final accuracy obtained was also an average value. The accuracy obtained using ELM classifier with K-fold cross validation was 77%. Whereas the efficiency achieved using SVM was 94.59%. Hence the proposed method can be used to assess the vascular health analysing PPG signals in the post-adolescent age group.", null, "This study examined the Twitter streams and websites of 36 university innovation centers and identified 14 service categories the centers offered. Exploring the present Twitter use practices of innovation centers and the services the centers provide can inform the design and planning of service offerings at new innovation centers and support training for center staff in the use of this social media platform. In addition, existing innovation centers can benchmark their service offerings against those services. Furthermore, mapping the services the innovation centers offer to the activities in an innovation workflow model can help center managers optimize the information architecture of their websites and resource guides. In this way, students can easily be informed about the help and resources available for each activity or phase of the innovation process. A comparison of the tweet categories identified in the present study with those of academic libraries assembled in a previous study revealed significant overlap, but some differences as well. In contrast to the Twitter accounts of academic libraries, the Twitter accounts of innovation centers did not tweet about their information services even if they offered them. Innovation centers also did not use Twitter to provide Q&A services to their users. Furthermore, innovation centers tweeted not only about the technological resources they provided, but also about the human resources they recruited to serve as student mentors and advisors. Finally, technology use was more mediated in innovation centers than in libraries, and some centers offered their users fee-based assistance from professionals with their 3D design and printing tasks.", "Machine vision for precision agriculture has attracted considerable research interest in recent years. The aim of this paper is to review the most recent work in the application of machine vision to agriculture, mainly for crop farming.

Studies of different agricultural activities that support crop harvesting are reviewed, such as fruit grading, fruit counting, and yield estimation. Moreover, plant health monitoring approaches are addressed, including weed, insect, and disease detection. Finally, recent research efforts considering vehicle guidance systems and agricultural harvesting robots are also reviewed.", "A new, bio-inspired printed monopole antenna (PMA) model is applied to monitor partial discharge (PD) activity in high voltage insulating systems. An optimized sensor was obtained by designing a PMA in accordance with the characteristics of the electromagnetic signal produced by PD. An ultra-wideband (UWB) antenna was obtained by applying the truncated ground plane technique. The patch geometry was bio-inspired by that of the Inga Marginata leaf, resulting in a significant reduction in size. To verify the operating frequency and gain of the PMA, measurements were carried out in an anechoic chamber. The results show that the antenna operating bandwidth covers most of the frequency range of PD occurrence. Moreover, the antenna presented a good sensitivity (mean gain of 3.63 dBi). The antenna performance was evaluated through comparative results with the standard IEC 60270 method. For this purpose, simultaneous tests were carried out in a PD generator arrangement, composed by an oil cell with point-to-plane electrode configurations. The developed PMA can be classified as an optimized sensor for PD detection and suitable for substation application, since it is able to measure PD radiated signals with half the voltage levels obtained from the IEC method and is immune to corona discharges.", "Y The world is facing an unprecedented economic, social and political crisis with the spread of COVID-19. The Corona Virus (COVID-19) and its global spread have resulted in declaring a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The deadly pandemic of 21st century has spread its wings across the globe with an exponential increase in the number of cases in many countries. The developing and underdeveloped countries are struggling hard to counter the rapidly growing and widespread challenge of COVID-19 because it has greatly influenced the global economies whereby the underdeveloped countries are more affected by its devastating impacts, especially the life of the lowincome population. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) were particularly useful in spreading key emergency information and helping to maintain extensive social distancing. Updated information and testing results were published on national and local government websites. Mobile devices were used to support early testing and contact tracing. The government provided free smartphone apps that flagged infection hotspots with text alerts on testing and local cases. The purpose of this research work is to provide an in depth overview of emerging technologies and recent ICT developments to combat COVID-19 Pandemic. Finally, the author highlights open challenges in order to give future research directions.", "Optimization of engineered biological systems requires precise control over the rates and timing of gene expression. Optogenetics is used to dynamically control gene expression as an alternative to conventional chemical-based methods since it provides a more convenient interface between digital control software and microbial culture. Here, we describe the construction of a real-time optogenetics platform, which performs closed-loop control over the CcaR-CcaS two-plasmid system in Escherichia coli. We showed the first model-based design approach by constructing a nonlinear representation of the CcaR-CcaS system, tuned the model through open-loop experimentation to capture the experimental behavior, and applied the model in silico to inform the necessary changes to build a closed-loop optogenetic control system. Our system periodically induces and represses the CcaR-CcaS system while recording optical density and fluorescence using image processing techniques. We highlight the facile nature of constructing our system and how our modelbased design approach will potentially be used to model other systems requiring closed-loop optogenetic control.", "The field of cyber-physical systems is a growing IT research area that addresses the deep integration of computing, communication and process control, possibly with humans in the loop. The goal of such area is to define modelling, controlling and programming methodologies for designing and managing complex mechatronics systems, also called industrial agents. Our research topic mainly focuses on the area of data mining and analysis by means of multi-agent orchestration of intelligent sensor nodes using internet protocols, providing also web-based HMI visualizations for data interpretability and analysis. Thanks to the rapid spreading of IoT systems, supported by modern and efficient telecommunication infrastructures and new decentralized control paradigms, the field of service-oriented programming finds new application in wireless sensor networks and microservices paradigm: we adopted such paradigm in the implementation of two different industrial use cases. Indeed, we expect a concrete and deep use of such technologies with 5G spreading. In the article, we describe the common software architectural pattern in IoT applications we used for the distributed smart sensors, providing also design and implementation details. In the use case section, the prototypes developed as proof of concept and the KPIs used for the system validation are described to provide a concrete solution overview.", "This essay outlines how the 'hack' might offer a model for anthropological research in the face of the distributed relations evidenced by digital data. The argument builds on fieldwork with citizens and activists and looks at their attempts to understand and make use of the data produced by energy sensors and monitors. Drawing on their experiences, I suggest that 'the hack' emerges as an important form of practice that helps people navigate the place of data in social relations. Taking the hack not just as ethnographic observation but also as a methodological proposition, I use my ethnographic material on the practice of the hack to reconsider the anthropological challenge of doing ethnography of processes that are only perceptible through numerical or digital data. To explore the value of the hack for anthropology, I introduce an example of an attempt to do ethnography in the mode of the hack. The essay ends with reflections on how the hack might provide us with new ways of getting to grips with the anthropological implications of systemic and emergent relations that are both brought to light and remade through data.", "Neutron monitors have been the premier ground-based instruments for monitoring the near-Earth cosmic ray flux for more than 70 years. It is essential to continue with such measurements in order to extend this unique long-term time series. Moreover, with the recent interest of the aviation industry to space weather effects, and especially the radiation risk posed by solar energetic particles and galactic cosmic rays, it is vital to extend the current neutron monitor network in order to provide near-real-time measurements to the space weather community. In this paper we discuss a new electronics system that was retrofitted to the SANAE neutron monitor in Antarctica. We present initial results from this system, featuring very high temporal resolution and discuss the techniques applied to the data analysis. Based on these successful upgrades, we are confident that this system can be used to rejuvenate the aligning neutron monitor network, and even possibly to revive some of the decommissioned instruments.

Real-time measurement systems may be required, especially in the case of iron-dominated electromagnets with strong non-linear effects, to acquire the magnetic field and feed it back to various users. This work concerns the design and implementation of a new measurement system of this kind currently being deployed throughout the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) accelerator complex. We first discuss the measurement principle, the general system architecture and the technology employed, focusing in particular on the most critical and specialized components developed, that is, the field marker trigger generator and the magnetic flux integrator. We then present the results of a detailed metrological characterization of the integrator, including the aspects of drift estimation and correction, as well as the absolute gain calibration and frequency response. We finally discuss the latency of the whole acquisition chain and present an outline of future work to improve the capabilities of the system.", "The firmness of an apple is a commonly used indicator of quality and maturity during sorting and cold storage. Its dependence on the elastic properties means that vibration resonance tests are favored over other - often destructive - tests. We present a novel non-destructive and non-contacting method using laser-generated and laser-detected elastic waves to infer the elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio of an apple from the velocity of surface and body waves. In addition, we analyze the attenuation of these waves. Although the elastic and anelastic properties all decay with age, attenuation is the most sensitive to changes in ripeness of the apple.

The effectiveness of the proposed estimation method was evaluated by utilizing a non-linear dynamic model of a flexible manipulator using the co-rotational finite element method. This modeling utilized multiple co-ordinate (co-rotational) systems which rotated and translated with each element, allowing the investigation of flexible manipulator dynamics with the large rotational and translational motion. Smart piezoelectric sensors, embedded to the flexible manipulator, were used for vibration sensing purposes. Simulation results on a flexible manipulator demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed estimation method in predicting the movement of end-effector with a satisfactory accuracy. Experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the estimation method. Results from the vision analysis, based on experimental results, demonstrated the feasibility of the estimation method for a further flexible manipulator application with the eye-in-hand system.", "In this paper, we describe a cryogenic, servo-controlled biaxial friction apparatus designed to measure the deformational behaviors of ice. The apparatus is specifically designed to accurately achieve and measure the low differential stresses applicable to deforming ice on earth and on icy satellites. We can apply loads in the range similar to 2-1800 kPa and velocities up to 4 mm/s, with resolution of 39 Pa and 0.7 mu m, respectively. Precise temperature control, measurement, and insulation allow testing at constant temperature (from -2 to -30 degrees C) for prolonged periods of time. The apparatus is tested with various plastics as well as with polycrystalline ice samples and the results are consistent with previously published values. Critical components of the instrument are described along with examples of data collection schemes and preliminary results. The flexibility of the design allows for both glaciological and planetary applications over a range of deformational behaviors including friction, anelastic, and viscous. Published by AIP Publishing.", "Measuring the growth rate of non-model anaerobic microbes typically requires the use of time-consuming and often destructive manual measurements. Here, an Arduino based automatic pressure evaluation system (A-APES) was developed to automatically measure the rate of fermentation gas production as a proxy for microbial growth in anaerobic systems. The A-APES system measures accumulated gas pressure in sealed cultures accurately at high-resolution, while venting the system at programmed intervals to prevent over pressurization. The utility of A-APES is demonstrated in this study by quantifying the growth rate and phases of a biomass-degrading anaerobic gut fungus, which cannot be otherwise measured via conventional techniques due to its association with particulate substrates. Given the utility of the A-APES approach, we provide a complete construction guide to fabricate the device, which is three times less expensive compared to existing commercial alternatives.", "Digital capitalism is guided by the organising principles of digital automation, information processing, and communication. It rests on the consolidation of relations of exploitation of digital labour based on flexibility and generating precarity. It makes profit from user data under conditions of surveillance. What would an alternative paradigm look like? This paper aims to sketch a possible socialist society resting on digital technology but organised on a different logic, namely that of autonomous production, leisure, and social engagement. It draws on relevant theories of the Left, evaluates them against the reality of digital capitalism, and suggests structural and user practice alternatives that can pave the way towards a digital/communicative socialism. This paper engages with the works of Czech philosopher Radovan Richta (1924-1983) and Austrian-French philosopher Andre Gorz (1923-2007). It shows that their ideas on the scientific and technological revolution and post-industrial socialism are highly relevant for the analysis and discussion of digital/communicative socialism.", "Gut microbial metabolism is associated with host longevity. However, because it requires direct manipulation of microbial metabolism in situ, establishing a causal link between these two processes remains challenging. We demonstrate an optogenetic method to control gene expression and metabolite production from bacteria residing in the host gut. We genetically engineer an Escherichia coli strain that secretes colanic acid (CA) under the quantitative control of light. Using this optogenetically-controlled strain to induce CA production directly in the Caenorhabditis elegans gut, we reveal the local effect of CA in protecting intestinal mitochondria from stress-induced hyper-fragmentation. We also demonstrate that the lifespan-extending effect of this strain is positively correlated with the intensity of green light, indicating a dose-dependent CA benefit on the host. Thus, optogenetics can be used to achieve quantitative and temporal control of gut bacterial metabolism in order to reveal its local and systemic effects on host health and aging.", "Alternative energy generated from people's footsteps in a crowded area is sufficient to power smart electronic devices with low consumption. This paper aims to present the development of an energy harvesting floor-called Genpath-using a rotational electromagnetic (EM) technique to generate electricity from human footsteps. The dynamic models of the electro-mechanical systems were developed using MATLAB/Simulink to predict the energy performances of Genpath and help fine-tune the design parameters. The system in Genpath comprises two main parts: the EM generator and the Power Management and Storage (PMS) circuit. For the EM generator, the conversion mechanism for linear translation to rotation was designed by using the rack-pinion and lead-screw mechanism. Based on the simulation analysis, the averaged energy of the lead-screw model is greater than that of the rack-pinion model. Thus, prototype-II of Genpath with 12-V-DC generator, lead-screw mechanism was recently built. It shows better performance when compared to the previous prototype-I of Genpath with 24-V-DC-generator, rack-pinion mechanism. Both prototypes have an allowable displacement of 15 mm. The Genpath prototype-II produces an average energy of up to 702 mJ (or average power of 520 mW) per footstep. The energy provided by Genpath prototype-II is increased by approximately 184% when compared to that of the prototype-I. The efficiency of the EM-generator system is similar to 26% based on the 2-W power generation from the heel strike of a human's walk in one step. Then, the PMS circuit was developed to harvest energy into the batteries and to supply the other part to specific loads. The experiment showed that the designed PMS circuit has the overall efficiency of 74.72%. The benefit of the design system is for a lot of applications, such as a wireless sensor and Internet of Thing applications.", "Recently, to address the astonishing capacity requirement of 5G, researchers are investigating the possibility of combining different technologies with ultra-dense networks (UDNs). However, the ultra-dense deployment of small cells in the coverage area of conventional macrocells known as UDNs introduces new technical challenges such as severe interference, unfairness in radio resource sharing, unnecessary handover, a significant increase in energy consumption, and degraded quality-of-service (QoS). To overcome these challenges and achieve the performance requirements in 5G, there is a need to combine UDNs with other 5G enabling technologies and then, design intelligent management techniques for better performance of the overall networks. Hence, in this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on different generations of wireless networks, 5G new radio (NR) standards, 5G enabling technologies and the importance of combining UDNs with other 5G technologies. Also, we present an extensive overview of the recent advances and research challenges in intelligent management techniques and backhaul solutions in the last five years for the combination of UDNs and other enabling technologies that offers the visions of 5G. We summarise the mathematical tools widely exploited in solving these problems and the performance metrics used to evaluate the intelligent management algorithms. Moreover, we classify various intelligent management algorithms according to the adopted enabling technologies, benefits, challenges addressed, mathematical tools and performance metrics used. Finally, we summarise the open research challenges, provide design guidelines and potential research directions for the development of intelligent management techniques and backhaul solutions for the combination of UDNs and other 5G technologies.", "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused the COVID-19 pandemic that has been spreading around the world since December 2019. More than 10 million affected cases and more than half a million deaths have been reported so far, while no vaccine is yet available as a treatment. Considering the global healthcare urgency, several techniques, including whole genome sequencing and computed tomography imaging have been employed for diagnosing infected people. Considerable efforts are also directed at detecting and preventing different modes of community transmission. Among them is the rapid detection of virus presence on different surfaces with which people may come in contact. Detection based on non-contact optical techniques is very helpful in managing the spread of the virus, and to aid in the disinfection of surfaces. Nanomaterial-based methods are proven suitable for rapid detection. Given the immense need for science led innovative solutions, this manuscript critically reviews recent literature to specifically illustrate nano-engineered effective and rapid solutions. In addition, all the different techniques are critically analyzed, compared, and contrasted to identify the most promising methods. Moreover, promising research ideas for high accuracy of detection in trace concentrations, via color change and light-sensitive nanostructures, to assist fingerprint techniques (to identify the virus at the contact surface of the gas and solid phase) are also presented.", "As telecommunication systems evolve towards new-generation architectures, likewise, new protocols are created in order to improve efficiency. One of these protocols is Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which controls the transmission bit rate in function of network congestion. Nevertheless, in wireless communications, there appear problems such as noise and interference, for which TCP was not designed. Based on these problems, there exist some methods trying to mitigate congestion, such as explicit loss notifications and the use of end-to-end codification. The aim of this work was to propose a wireless TCP protocol improvement, considering a negative acknowledgment (NACK), which allows to differentiate between losses due to congestion and losses due to wireless channel issues. NACK employs a small protocol packet and produces improvement in the quality of service metrics. The experiments were carried out in in-door and out-door environments, over an online video game scenario, and over a long-distance wireless link between two islands. The average results show a 25-percent delay improvement and a 5-percent jitter improvement when compared to the original TCP Reno protocol, while for throughput a 90-percent improvement was achieved for distances between 100 and 414 m.", "Hackerspaces are part of a phenomenon emerging all over the world of building alternative spaces and infrastructure for research, experimenting and learning. They differ from other institutionally established spaces in their principles of autonomy: they are financed and managed by their own members and, as a result, they enjoy greater freedom in the definition of their themes and issues. In this article, we present the results of a research project carried out in 2017 about Brazilian hackerspaces. In the analysis, we resorted to the structure proposed by Smith and others (2017) in their study about grassroots innovation movements, organized into four complementary aspects as follows: context, framings, spaces and strategies, and pathways. Thus, we contemplate the history of the movement in Brazil; meanings and narratives shared by participants; spaces and strategies employed in their structure and organization; and, finally, case studies selected because they can be articulated with the local community issues. The survey identified 21 active hackerspaces in the country in 2017, distributed in the Midwest, Northeast, Southeast and South. Sixteen of them answered a questionnaire that revealed the diversity of their activities and proximity to the university community, among other characteristics. The case studies have shown that, besides contributing to the broader circulation of technological knowledge, hackerspaces are also spaces for the development of practices and technologies that seek to answer social and environmental issues, such as sustainability in the disposal of electronic waste and citizen monitoring of the environment.", "The use of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) has rapidly grown in many civil applications since the early 2010s. Nowadays, a large variety of reliable low-cost UAS sensors and controllers are available. However, contrary to ultralight aircrafts (ULAs), UASs have a too small operational range to efficiently cover large areas. Flight regulations prevailing in many countries further reduced this operational range; in particular, the \"within visual line of sight\" rule. This study presents a new system for image acquisition and high-quality photogrammetry of large scale areas (>10 km(2)). It was developed by upscaling the UAS paradigm, i.e., low-cost sensors and controllers, little (or no) on-board active stabilization, and adequate structure from motion photogrammetry, to an ULA platform. Because the system is low-cost (good quality-price ratio of UAS technologies), multi-sensors (large variety of available UAS sensors) and versatile (high ULA operational flexibility and more lenient regulation than for other platforms), the possible applications are numerous in miscellaneous research domains. The system was described in detail and illustrated from the flight and images acquisition to the photogrammetric routine. The system was successfully used to acquire high resolution and high quality RGB and multispectral images, and produced precisely georeferenced digital elevation model (DEM) and orthophotomosaics for a forested area of 1200 ha. The system can potentially carry any type of sensors. The system compatibility with any sensor can be tested, in terms of image quality and flight plan, with the proposed method. This study also highlighted a major technical limitation of the low-cost thermal infrared cameras: the too high integration time with respect to the flight speed of most UASs and ULAs. By providing the complete information required for reproducing the system, the authors seek to encourage its implementation in different geographical locations and scientific contexts, as well as, its combination with other sensors, in particular, laser imaging detection and ranging (LiDAR) and hyperspectral.", null, "The Cosmic-Ray Extremely Distributed Observatory (CREDO) is a newly formed, global collaboration dedicated to observing and studying cosmic rays (CR) and cosmic-ray ensembles (CRE): groups of at least two CR with a common primary interaction vertex or the same parent particle. The CREDO program embraces testing known CR and CRE scenarios, and preparing to observe unexpected physics, it is also suitable for multi-messenger and multi-mission applications. Perfectly matched to CREDO capabilities, CRE could be formed both within classical models (e.g., as products of photon-photon interactions), and exotic scenarios (e.g., as results of decay of Super-Heavy Dark Matter particles). Their fronts might be significantly extended in space and time, and they might include cosmic rays of energies spanning the whole cosmic-ray energy spectrum, with a footprint composed of at least two extensive air showers with correlated arrival directions and arrival times. As the CRE are predominantly expected to be spread over large areas and, due to the expected wide energy range of the contributing particles, such a CRE detection might only be feasible when using all available cosmic-ray infrastructure collectively, i.e., as a globally extended network of detectors. Thus, with this review article, the CREDO Collaboration invites the astroparticle physics community to actively join or to contribute to the research dedicated to CRE and, in particular, to pool together cosmic-ray data to support specific CRE detection strategies.", "We present a tutorial introduction to the multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles, often simply referred as drones. We first explain typical configuration, components and construction of the drones. We then provide basic kinematic and dynamic modeling of drones and their principle of flight. Some representative motion control techniques are then presented, which take into account the issue of under-actuation of the drones. State estimation problem of the drones, that is crucial for their proper flying, yet, should be done only by using onboard sensors and their sensor fusion, is explained. Some emerging research directions requiring capability beyond typical drones are also mentioned.", "Optogenetic tools allow regulation of cellular processes with light, which can be delivered with spatiotemporal resolution. In previous work, we used cryptochrome 2 (CRY2) and CIB1, Arabidopsis proteins that interact upon light illumination, to regulate transcription with light in yeast. While adopting this approach to regulate transcription in mammalian cells, we observed light-dependent redistribution and clearing of CRY2-tethered proteins within the nucleus. The nuclear clearing phenotype was dependent on the presence of a dimerization domain contained within the CRY2-fused transcriptional activators. We used this knowledge to develop two different approaches to regulate cellular protein levels with light: a system using CRY2 and CIB1 to induce protein expression with light through stimulation of transcription, and a system using CRY2 and a LOV-fused degron to simultaneously block transcription and deplete protein levels with light. These tools will allow precise, bi-directional control of gene expression in a variety of cells and model systems.", "The main target of the current study is to review the latest developments in accurate, reliable, and low-cost non-contact or remote techniques, including the usage of artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods, image processing (IP) system, and sensor technology for quality assessment in the food industry (FI). The IP systems and AI can be used for various purposes, such as classifying products based on size and shape, detecting product defects, the presence of microbes, and grading food quality. The sensor technology is now highly developed to assess food products' quality and safety due to the dramatic growth of nanotechnology and biotechnology. Also, in this paper, it was tried to examine the role of robots in the FI and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of using them in the FI.", "Academic interest in designing medical technology appropriate for Africa continues to grow, with funding available for innovations that answer complex questions. However, there is significant engineering work required to realise the promised impact of an innovation, even when it is shared as an Open Source design for others to build on. With academic innovation more highly prized by journals, funding bodies and academic institutions, this results in split priorities, and can lead to a difficult balance between the humanitarian aims of the project and pursuit of novel research. We present the OpenFlexure Microscope project as an example of an innovative academic project pushing the limits of 3D printed instrumentation. The microscope is already undergoing trials for malaria diagnosis, but significant product development is still necessary to transition the project from a prototype to a certified in-vitro diagnostic device. In this paper, we consider the engineering work that is needed to move from prototype to product, and how best to structure this work to support distributed manufacturing across Africa. We highlight the need to focus not just on the necessary engineering, but also on documenting this work so it can be understood and reproduced by any potential manufacturer.", ["The aim of this paper is to critically assess the effect of 3D printing technologies on entrepreneurship. While 3D printing technologies (also known as 'additive manufacturing') have been considered as highly transformative technologies, they have been so far (despite over 30 years of existence) restricted to niche markets, and until recently, it seemed that only the largest firms were able to take advantage of those technologies. However, the cost of use of such technologies has sharply decreased over the past few years, and an increasing number of service companies offer both offline (Fab Labs, makerspaces, bureaus) and online (3D printing platforms) access to 3D printing capacities, enabling to \"bridge the gap\" and provide access to 3D printing technologies to everyone.", "In this context, using a case-based exploratory methodology, this research aims to explore the benefits of 3D printing technologies for entrepreneurs and new ventures, in particular in relation to overcoming specific challenges these smaller and younger structures face. After identifying the key types of hurdle faced by entrepreneurs - NPD issues, technical issues, market issues, financial issues, and business model issues - this article investigates the manner in which different forms of usage of 3D printing technologies - prototyping, tooling, direct manufacturing, distributed and localised manufacturing - can help alleviate each of those types of barrier.", "The results of this research indicate that 3D printing technologies are indeed likely to enable entrepreneurs to overcome the five main types of barriers they generally face. Furthermore, because of the very particular situation of entrepreneurs and new ventures and the specific challenges they face in terms of scale, access to markets, and lack of financial resources, 3D printing may in fact be more transformative for smaller and younger structures, than for larger and well-established corporations. However, this research also indicates that benefits for entrepreneurs derived from the use of 3D printing may depend on the degree of involvement of 3D printing in the overall productive process - the more the merrier - and that using 3D printing only at design and tooling stage, although helpful to some extent, may not be so impactful."], "To achieve high performance and high energy efficiency on near-future exascale computing systems, three key technology gaps needs to be bridged. These gaps include: energy efficiency and thermal control; extreme computation efficiency via HW acceleration and new arithmetics; methods and tools for seamless integration of reconfigurable accelerators in heterogeneous HPC multi-node platforms. TEXTAROSSA aims at tackling this gap through a co-design approach to heterogeneous HPC solutions, supported by the integration and extension of HW and SW IPs, programming models and tools derived from European research.", "Prototyping physical artifacts is a fundamental activity for both product development in industrial and engineering design domains and the development of digital fabrication skills. Prototyping is also essential for human-centric problem-solving in design education. Digital fabrication assists in rapid prototype development through computer-aided design and manufacturing tools. Due to the spread of makerspaces like fabrication laboratories (FabLabs) around the world, the use of digital fabrication tools for prototyping in educational institutes is becoming increasingly common. Studies on the social, environmental, and economic sustainability of digital fabrication have been carried out. However, none of them focus on sustainability and prototyping-based digital fabrication tools or design education. To bridge this research gap, a conceptual framework for sustainable prototyping based on a five-stage design thinking model is proposed. The framework, which is based on a comprehensive literature review of social, economic, and environmental sustainability factors of digital fabrication, is applied to evaluate a prototyping process that took place in a FabLab in an education context aimed at enhancing sustainability. Three case studies are used to evaluate the proposed framework. Based on the findings, recommendations are presented for sustainable prototyping using digital fabrication tools.", "A private fifth generation (5G) network is a dedicated 5G network with enhanced communication characteristics, unified connectivity, optimized services, and customized security within a specific area. By subsuming the advantages of both public and non-public 5G networks, private 5G networks have found their applications across industry, business, utilities, and the public sector. As a promising accelerator for Industry 4.0, the concept of a private 5G network has recently attracted significant research attention from industry and academia. This article provides a comprehensive review of research on private 5G networks. Specifically, this paper first provides an overview of the concept and architecture of private 5G networks. It then discusses implementation issues and key enabling technologies for private 5G networks, followed by their more appealing use cases and existing real-life demonstrations. Finally, it examines some research challenges and future directions regarding private 5G networks.", "This paper presents the development of a new Aerodynamic Ball Levitation Laboratory Plant at the Center of Modern Control Techniques and Industrial Informatics (CMCT & II). The entire design process of the plant is described, including the component selection process, the physical construction of the plant, the design of a printed circuit board (PCB) powered by a microcontroller, and the implementation of its firmware. A parametric mathematical model of the laboratory plant is created, whose parameters are then estimated using a nonlinear least-squares method based on acquired experimental data. The Kalman filter and the optimal state-space feedback control are designed based on the obtained mathematical model. The designed controller is then validated using the physical plant.", "This paper presents a thorough comparison of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) v1.2 and Datagram TLS (DTLS) v1.2 handshake in 6TiSCH networks. TLS and DTLS play a crucial role in protecting daily Internet traffic, while 6TiSCH is a major low-power link layer technology for the IoT. In recent years, DTLS has been the de-facto security protocol to protect IoT application traffic, mainly because it runs over lightweight, unreliable transport protocols, i.e., UDP. However, unlike the DTLS record layer, the handshake requires reliable message delivery. It, therefore, incorporates sequence numbers, a retransmission timer, and a fragmentation algorithm. Our goal is to study how well these mechanisms perform, in the constrained setting of 6TiSCH, compared to TCP's reliability algorithms, relied upon by TLS. We port the mbedTLS library to OpenWSN, a 6TiSCH reference implementation, and deploy the code on the state-of-the-art OpenMote platform. We show that, when the peers use an ideal channel, the DTLS handshake uses up to 800 less and completes 0.6 s faster. Nonetheless, using an unreliable communication link, the DTLS handshake duration suffers a performance penalty of roughly 45%, while TLS' handshake duration degrades by merely 15%. Similarly, the number of exchanged bytes doubles for DTLS while for TLS the increase is limited to 15%. The results indicate that IoT product developers should account for network characteristics when selecting a security protocol. Neglecting to do so can negatively impact the battery lifetime of the entire constrained network.", "Contribution: An education innovation in control engineering using practical setups and its evaluation based on a three-year student feedback study and examination grades. Background: Based on extensive research, education's transition toward active learning and more practical experience has been shown to increase learning outcomes. Contrary to virtual and remote labs, a practical session with an individual setup for each student provides the most practical experience. Intended Outcomes: To show a positive effect on learning performance by integrating practical sessions in basic control engineering. Application Design: Presenting low cost setups that can be mass produced and adapt to the course's growing complexity. These setups are evaluated during a three-year feedback study. Findings: The developed setups increased understanding of theoretical concepts. The new methodology significantly improved students' average grades. The students' interest in control theory is triggered. This case study could guide other institutions toward successfully implementing highly individual practical sessions for large groups.", "Today's mobile devices contain densely packaged system-on-chips (SoCs) with multi-core, high-frequency CPUs and complex pipelines. In parallel, sophisticated SoC-assisted security mechanisms have become commonplace for protecting device data, such as trusted execution environments, full-disk and file-based encryption. Both advancements have dramatically complicated the use of conventional physical attacks, requiring the development of specialised attacks. In this survey, we consolidate recent developments in physical fault injections and side-channel attacks on modern mobile devices. In total, we comprehensively survey over 50 fault injection and side-channel attack papers published between 2009-2021. We evaluate the prevailing methods, compare existing attacks using a common set of criteria, identify several challenges and shortcomings, and suggest future directions of research.

Specifically, the chapter redefined the implantation of physical optode-electrode assembly on primate for simultaneous photo-switching and data recording from the complexly arranged neuron clusters. Specially, a number of modern commercial commutators are listed on the basis of flexible rotator optical joint, number of LEDs, magnetic base and low torque. However, the chapter highlights certain standard protocols used in the implantation of optode and electrode on the primate skull. For efficient optical stimulation and signal detection, it revised certain significant contributions on implementation of multimode fibres, photonic CMOS integrated, super flexible optofluidic ultrathin channel, iridium oxide electrodes and pulse width modulation control on different power levels and duty cycles. Specifically, the authors plotted different irradiance curves of mammalian brain tissues in linear scale at three wavelengths 473 nm, 561 nm and 630 nm. Successively, it is a collection of different wireless optogenetics systems of certain strength in each model as lightweight, super flexibility, optofluidic light delivery, small size, minimal heat emission and wide range output power control. Practically, a number of biomedical imaging techniques, that is, computer tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, micropositron emission technology, micro-ultrasound, opto-microelectrocorticography and electroretinography is implemented for studying the physiology and behaviour changes of primate under simultaneous photostimulation.", "Various situations, such as injuries or long-term disabilities, can result in people receiving physical assistance while in bed. We present a robotic system for bedside assistance that consists of a robotic bed and a mobile manipulator (i.e., a wheeled robot with arms) that work together to provide better assistance. Many assistive tasks depend on moving with respect to the person's body, and the complementary physical and perceptual capabilities of the two robots help with respect to this general goal. The system provides autonomy for common tasks, as well as an interface for direct teleoperation of the two robots. Autonomy handles coarse motions of the robots by estimating the person's pose using a pressure sensing mat and then moving the robots to configurations optimized for the task. After completing these motions, the user is given fine control of the robots to complete the task. In an evaluation using a medical mannequin, we found that the robotic bed's motion and perception each improved the assistive robotic system's performance. The system achieved 100% success over 9 trials involving 3 tasks. Using the system with the bed movement or the body pose estimation capabilities turned off resulted in success in only 33% or 78% of the trials, respectively. We also evaluated our system with Henry Evans, a person with severe quadriplegia, in his home. In a formal test, Henry successfully used the bedside-assistance system to perform 3 different tasks, 5 times each, without any failures. Henry's feedback on the system was positive regarding usefulness and ease of use, and he noted benefits of using our system over fully manual teleoperation. Overall, our results suggest that a robotic bed and a mobile manipulator can work collaboratively to provide effective personal assistance and that the combination of the two robots is beneficial.", "In this work, 1 GHz video data was collected by a CMOS camera and successfully transmitted by the electro-optic (EO) modulator driven by an external modulation module integrated onto the same chip.

To make full use of these power consumers' AMI data, a data-driven abnormity assessment algorithm for low-voltage power consumers is proposed based on the CRITIC (CRiteria Importance Though Intercrieria Correlation) method and the improved radar chart method. First, the indexes that characterize the consumer's abnormal features of power consumption and supplies are extracted from the original AMI data. Then, the abnormity assessment algorithm is used to determine power consumers' abnormal features of power consumption and supplies by using the extracted indexes, in which the weights of indexes are determined by the CRITIC method and the assessment value of abnormal features is determined by the improved radar chart method. Next, the abnormity assessment algorithm is used again to assess power consumers' power consumption and supplies abnormities. Finally, the effectiveness of proposed algorithm is demonstrated in case studies by employing AMI data collected from power utilities in Zhejiang Province, China, and the results show that the algorithm can be used in actual applications.", "Questionnaire-based surveys are a common data collection tool in events research as established by earlier reviews of methods within the literature. This article examines and critiques the historic development, current position, gaps in knowledge, and future implications for survey-based research. Two-hundred eighty-six articles from four events-specific journals were reviewed. Some diversity is found within survey-based research; however, the majority was carried out: as a single method (86%), in physical proximity to the event (67%), during the event (49%), using paper-based forms (65%), designed for self-completion (94%). The most common events targeted were: sports (43%) festivals & celebrations (20%), and music (12%). The stakeholders targeted were: audiences (54%), nonparticipants (16%), and managers (12%). Sampling methods, where stated, were likely to be random (23%) or convenience based (22%). Despite the predominance of this data collection tool, numerous areas are ideally in need of further understanding and experimentation. Mixed methods, multiple surveys, and more deliberate approaches to sampling are required. Despite an audience focus, \"before and after\" studies are lacking. Electronic surveys and other emerging technologies undoubtedly provide options but these do not appear to have been investigated or adopted with sufficient rigor. Targeting stakeholders other than audiences, covering a broader range of events, and longitudinal studies would also be desirable. The use of survey-based research by policy makers and funders is discussed as it potentially orients towards what the authors term \"operationalized knowledge management.\" A brief but comprehensive typology of survey methods is established to aid future researchers.", "This article investigates the potential role of the commons in the future transformation of digital capitalism by comparing it to the role of the commons in the transition to capitalism. In medieval and early modern Europe the commons supported gradual social and technological innovation as well as a new civil society organized around the combination of commons-based petty production and new ideals of freedom and equality. Today the new commons generated by the global real subsumption of ordinary life processes are supporting similar forms of commons-based petty production. After positioning the new petty producers within the framework of the crisis of digital capitalism, the article concludes by extrapolating a number of hypothetical scenarios for their role in its future transformation.", "The LHC Schottky beam diagnostic system has the potential to measure beam parameters such as tune, chromaticity and momentum spread in a non-invasive way. It does so by detecting beam induced signals at 4.8 GHz, and extracting the characteristic modulation caused by incoherent motion of particles within a bunch. The system was commissioned in 2011 and provided satisfactory beam-parameter measurements during LHC Run I for lead-ions. However, for protons its usability was substantially limited due to strong interfering common-mode signals. The system was upgraded with optimized traveling-wave pick-ups and an improved microwave signal path. Design and operational aspects for the complete system are shown, and the results from measurements with LHC beams in Run II are presented and discussed. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a promising tool to support the diagnosis and evaluation of abnormalities in the human brain. The EEG sensors record the brain activity directly with excellent time resolution. In this study, EEG sensor with 19 electrodes were used to test the background activities of the brains of five vascular dementia (VaD), 15 stroke-related patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 15 healthy subjects during a working memory (WM) task. The objective of this study is twofold. First, it aims to enhance the recorded EEG signals using a novel technique that combines automatic independent component analysis (AICA) and wavelet transform (WT), that is, the AICA-WT technique; second, it aims to extract and investigate the spectral features that characterize the post-stroke dementia patients compared to the control subjects. The proposed AICA-WT technique is a four-stage approach. In the first stage, the independent components (ICs) were estimated. In the second stage, three-step artifact identification metrics were applied to detect the artifactual components. The components identified as artifacts were marked as critical and denoised through DWT in the third stage. In the fourth stage, the corrected ICs were reconstructed to obtain artifact-free EEG signals. The performance of the proposed AICA-WT technique was compared with those of two other techniques based on AICA andWT denoising methods using cross-correlation XCorr and peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) (ANOVA, p < 0.05). The AICA-WT technique exhibited the best artifact removal performance. The assumption that there would be a deceleration of EEG dominant frequencies in VaD and MCI patients compared with control subjects was assessed with AICA-WT (ANOVA, p < 0.05). Therefore, this study may provide information on post-stroke dementia particularly VaD and stroke-related MCI patients through spectral analysis of EEG background activities that can help to provide useful diagnostic indexes by using EEG signal processing.", "Virus-based therapies have gained momentum as the next generation of treatments for a variety of serious diseases. In order to make these therapies more controllable, stimulus-responsive viral vectors capable of sensing and responding to specific environmental inputs are currently being developed. A number of viruses naturally respond to endogenous stimuli, such as pH, redox, and proteases, which are present at different concentrations in diseases and at different organ and organelle sites. Additionally, rather than relying on natural viral properties, efforts are underway to engineer viruses to respond to endogenous stimuli in new ways as well as to exogenous stimuli, such as temperature, magnetic field, and optical light. Viruses with stimulus-responsive capabilities, either nature-evolved or human-engineered, will be reviewed to capture the current state of the field. Stimulus-responsive viral vector design considerations as well as gaps in current research efforts will be identified.", "For use in autonomous micro air vehicles, visual sensors must not only be small, lightweight and insensitive to light variations; on-board autopilots also require fast and accurate optical flow measurements over a wide range of speeds. Using an auto-adaptive bio-inspired Michaelis-Menten Auto- adaptive Pixel (M(2)APix) analog silicon retina, in this article, we present comparative tests of two optical flow calculation algorithms operating under lighting conditions from 6 X 10(-7) to 1.6 X 10(-2) W.cm(-2) (i. e., from 0.2 to 12,000 lux for human vision). Contrast \"time of travel\" between two adjacent light-sensitive pixels was determined by thresholding and by cross- correlating the two pixels' signals, with measurement frequency up to 5 kHz for the 10 local motion sensors of the M2APix sensor. While both algorithms adequately measured optical flow between 25 degrees/s and 1000 degrees/s, thresholding gave rise to a lower precision, especially due to a larger number of outliers at higher speeds. Compared to thresholding, cross-correlation also allowed for a higher rate of optical flow output (99 Hz and 1195 Hz, respectively) but required substantially more computational resources.", "The current standard protocols for characterizing the optogenetic circuit of bacterial cells using flow cytometry in light tubes and light exposure of culture plates are tedious, labor-intensive, and cumbersome.

In the bioreactor, optical density measurements, reporter protein fluorescence detection, and light input stimuli are provided by four light-emitting diode sources and two photodetectors. Once calibrated, the device can cultivate microbial cells and record their growth and gene expression without human intervention. We measure gene expression during cell growth with different organic substrates (glucose, succinate, acetate, pyruvate) as carbon sources in minimal medium and the optogenetic circuit by serial dilution passages. demonstrate evolutionary tuning of the optogenetic circuit by serial dilution passages.", ["Purpose - The national technology accumulation pattern in three- dimensional (3D) printing technology field has not yet been studied until now.

Large aircraft with complex navigation systems rely on a variety of sensors including radio frequency aids and high performance inertial systems rendering them somewhat resistant to GPS denial.

Furthermore, the physics and characteristics of thermal sensors will also be presented to provide insight into challenges when integrating thermal sensors in place of conventional visual spectrum sensors.", "We describe a mathematical framework for evaluating timing offset and timing noise in channel sounders based on a second-order deterministic model and a stochastic metric based on the Allan deviation. Using this framework, we analyze the timing offset and noise for a 1-6-GHz correlation-based channel sounder that uses rubidium (Rb) clocks to provide a common timebase between the transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx). We study timing behavior in three clock-distribution configurations. In the \"untethered\" configuration, the Tx and Rx each have an Rb clock, and no physical timing cable is connected between the clocks. In the \"tethered\" configuration, a coaxial cable synchronizes timing between the two separate clocks. Finally, a benchmark \"single-clock\" configuration is used where a single Rb clock drives the Tx and Rx.", "Embedded processors are widely used in various systems working on different tasks with different workloads. A more complex micro-architecture leads to better peak performance and worse power consumption. Shutting down the units designed for performance enhancement could improve energy efficiency in low-workload scenarios. In this paper, we evaluated the energy distribution in various embedded processors. According to the analysis, pipeline registers and the dynamic branch predictor, which are employed for better peak performance, have great impacts on energy efficiency. Thus, we proposed an ultra-low-power processor with variable micro-architecture. The processor is based on a 4-stage pipeline core with a Gshare branch predictor, and all units work in high-performance mode. In normal mode, the Gshare predictor is shut down and Always-Not-Taken prediction is used. In low-power mode, some of the pipeline registers are bypassed to avoid unnecessary energy dissipation and improve executing efficiency. A mode register (MR) is designed to indicate current working mode. Switching between different modes is controlled by the software. The proposed core is implemented in 40 nm technology and simulated with the traces of 17 benchmarks in Embench. The average amounts of power consumed by the respective modes are 41.7 mu W, 59.7 mu W and 71.1 mu W. The results show that normal mode (N-mode) and low-power mode (L-mode) consume 16.08% and 41.37% less power than high-performance mode (H-mode) on average. In best case scenarios, they could save 25.36% and 49.30% more power than H-mode. Considering the execution efficiency evaluated by instructions per cycle (IPC), the proposed processor consumes 7.78% or 51.57% less energy for each instruction than the baseline core. The area of the proposed processor is only 7.19% larger than the baseline core, and only 3.08% more power is consumed in H-mode.", "The growing Internet of Things (IoT) market demands side-channel attack resistant, efficient, cryptographic implementations. Such implementations, however, are microarchitecture-specific, and cannot be implemented without an in-depth structural knowledge of the CPU and memory information leakage patterns; a description of such information leakages is presently not disclosed by any processor design company. In this work we propose the first Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) level framework for microarchitectural leakage characterization. Our framework allows to extract a microarchitectural leakage profile from a superscalar in-order processor; we infer detailed pipeline characteristics through the observation of instruction execution timings, and provide an identification of the datapath registers via a side-channel measuring setup. The extracted model can serve as a foundation for building solid countermeasures against side-channel attacks on software cryptographic implementations. We validate the extracted models on the ARM Cortex-M4 and ARM Cortex-M7 CPUs, two of the most widespread ARM microcontroller cores. Finally, as a further validation of the effectiveness of our derived model, we mount a successful attack on unprotected AES implementations for each of the examined platforms.", "The advent of microfluidics has enabled thorough control of cell manipulation experiments in so called lab on chips. Lab on chips foster the integration of actuation and detection systems, and require minute sample and reagent amounts. Typically employed microfluidic structures have similar dimensions as cells, enabling precise spatial and temporal control of individual cells and their local environments. Several strategies for high spatio-temporal control of cells in microfluidics have been reported in recent years, namely methods relying on careful design of the microfluidic structures (e.g. pinched flow), by integration of actuators (e.g. electrodes or magnets for dielectro-, acousto- and magneto-phoresis), or integrations thereof. This review presents the recent developments of cell experiments in microfluidics divided into two parts: an introduction to spatial control of cells in microchannels followed by special emphasis in the high temporal control of cell-stimulus reaction and quenching. In the end, the present state of the art is discussed in line with future perspectives and challenges for translating these devices into routine applications.", "This paper presents a system that is ideal for water monitoring over stretched distances. The system is composed of a computer-based control monitoring unit (CMU) and several remote process transceivers (RPTs). The CMU contains a software program and a transceiver. It issues commands to and receives sensor data from the RPTs. It also saves previous data and displays the current sensor data from each RPT through a graphical user interface. The RPTs are stationed along the length of water systems like rivers where water data are sampled and sent to the CMU. Sensor data include the temperature, level, and turbidity of the water at the location of a particular RPT. The scalability feature allows the system to cover a much extended distance along the length of a river. It is achieved through the ability of the RPTs to relay the command from the CMU to other RPTs and the data from other RPTs to the CMU using user-defined protocols. Test results show that an effective distance of 1300 m is achieved between the CMU and the nearest RPT and between RPTs. Further, there are no significant differences between the actual sensor data and the values received at the CMU.", "A microscope is an essential tool in biosciences and production quality laboratories for unveiling the secrets of microworlds.

This proposed optical microscope design aims to achieve high customization capabilities to allow whole 2D slide imaging and observation of 3D live specimens. The MicroHikari3D motion control system is based on the entry level 3D printer kit Tronxy X1 controlled from a server running in a Raspberry Pi 4. The server provides services to a client mobile app for video/image acquisition, processing, and a high level classification task by applying deep learning models.", "Observing brain activity in real life offers exciting possibilities like the support of physical health, mental well-being, and thought-controlled interaction modalities. The development of such applications is, however, strongly impeded by low accessibility to research-grade neural data and a lack of easy-to-use and comfortable sensors. To overcome these challenges, we present the cost-effective adaptation of concealed around-the-ear EEG electrodes (cEEGrids) to the open-source OpenBCI EEG signal acquisition platform. The system combines publicly available electronic components with 3D-printed parts, forming an easily replicable recording system for prolonged use and flexible application development. To demonstrate the system's feasibility, experimentally induced changes in visual stimulation and mental workload are replicated. Lastly, a novel application area is investigated, the observation of flow experiences through observation of temporal Alpha power changes. Support for a link between temporal Alpha power and flow is found, indicating an efficient engagement of verbal-analytic reasoning with intensified flow levels.", null, "Scores of papers show, given some robots, how to improve the useful work they perform. Continuing this line, we consider the efficiency of robot experiments by examining the feasibility of conducting several experiments simultaneously, interleaving execution and sharing resources between them. This paper lays theoretical groundwork for that concept and demonstrates its feasibility and utility.", "Coarse Grained Reconfigurable Arrays (CGRAs) are emerging as energy efficient accelerators providing a high grade of flexibility in both academia and industry. However, with the recent advancements in algorithms and performance requirements of applications, supporting only integer and logical arithmetic limits the interest of classical/traditional CGRAs. In this paper, we propose a novel CGRA architecture and associated compilation flow supporting both integer and floating-point computations for energy efficient acceleration of DSP applications. Experimental results show that the proposed accelerator achieves a maximum of 4.61x speedup compared to a DSP optimized, ultra low power RISC-V based CPU while executing seizure detection, a representative of wide range of EEG signal processing applications with an area overhead of 1.9x. The proposed CGRA achieves a maximum of 6.5x energy efficiency compared to the single core CPU. While comparing the execution with the multi-core CPU with 8 cores, the proposed CGRA achieves up to 4.4x energy gain.", "Spaceport America, a spectacle to see with curvilinear geometry that itself looks like a spacecraft rising out of the desert near Truth or Consequences, New Mexico, conveys a hope of the everyman astronaut. Yet this private-public project, spending over $200 million in state taxpayer money to build and with a $2.85 million operating budget for 2017, does not provide the vertical transport analog of an airport. As Virgin Galactic stalls in launching its astronomically-priced zero-gravity music festival and commercial passenger flights, the facilities have been dusted off for educational rocketry club launches and Hollywood film backdrops while most public access to the grounds is restricted to expensive guided tours. As with the Spaceport, access to outer space itself raises questions of public versus private ownership and exclusivity. With the shifting role of nation states in offplanet activity, there are openings for outer space to become another site of capital accumulation or to manifest as envisioned by social movements and \"community space programs.\" This paper traces the ongoing realignment of public and private interests in offworld activity, of which Spaceport America is representative, considering how notions of offworld access have evolved since the aspirational vision of space as a commons laid out in the 1967 UN Outer Space Treaty. The paper juxtaposes the emerging public-private hegemony with the actions of three autonomous space organizations that actively construct alternative political economic models, technological systems, and cultural imaginaries of offworld access.", "This paper describes how to implement a low-cost didactic platform designed to teach or reinforce discrete control theory concepts. The controllers used in this work (P, PI, PD, and PID) are suitable for undergraduate students but the same platform could be used to explain and test advanced controllers to graduate students. This document shows, step by step, how to control a DC motor speed and position, along with the most common problems and its solutions, commonly overlooked in the literature. It also explains how to simulate the system behavior and compares the simulations with the real data, showing an average correlation coefficient of rho=0.983. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

This article examines and critiques the historic development, current position, gaps in knowledge, and future implications for survey-based research. Two-hundred eighty-six articles from four events-specific journals were reviewed. Some diversity is found within survey-based research; however, the majority was carried out: as a single method (86%), in physical proximity to the event (67%), during the event (49%), using paper-based forms (65%), designed for self-completion (94%). The most common events targeted were: sports (43%) festivals & celebrations (20%), and music (12%). The stakeholders targeted were: audiences (54%), nonparticipants (16%), and managers (12%). Sampling methods, where stated, were likely to be random (23%) or convenience based (22%). Despite the predominance of this data collection tool, numerous areas are ideally in need of further understanding and experimentation. Mixed methods, multiple surveys, and more deliberate approaches to sampling are required. Despite an audience focus, \"before and after\" studies are lacking. Electronic surveys and other emerging technologies undoubtedly provide options but these do not appear to have been investigated or adopted with sufficient rigor. Targeting stakeholders other than audiences, covering a broader range of events, and longitudinal studies would also be desirable. The use of survey-based research by policy makers and funders is discussed as it potentially orients towards what the authors term \"operationalized knowledge management.\" A brief but comprehensive typology of survey methods is established to aid future researchers.", "This article investigates the potential role of the commons in the future transformation of digital capitalism by comparing it to the role of the commons in the transition to capitalism. In medieval and early modern Europe the commons supported gradual social and technological innovation as well as a new civil society organized around the combination of commons-based petty production and new ideals of freedom and equality. Today the new commons generated by the global real subsumption of ordinary life processes are supporting similar forms of commons-based petty production. After positioning the new petty producers within the framework of the crisis of digital capitalism, the article concludes by extrapolating a number of hypothetical scenarios for their role in its future transformation.", "Most very-large-scale integration (VLSI) designs of the global optical flow method focus on reducing external memory accesses due to global and iterative processes for low-power operation in mobile systems. However, to achieve this goal, considerable amounts of resources are used and the throughput is decreased. To address these issues, we propose a multirow-based propagation approach and an efficient VLSI architecture. This approach divides an image into multiple small subimages. The flow of each subimage is then estimated sequentially using a small amount of internal memory without accessing any external memory. To avoid discontinuity artifacts stemming from the boundaries of the subimages, boundary conditions are imposed based on the smoothness of the optical flow. In addition, the main equations of the global optical flow method are simplified to boost the processing speed. The experimental results demonstrate that the external memory bandwidth is reduced by 96.7% with negligible accuracy degradation. Furthermore, the proposed design uses 63.4%-98% less internal memory and achieves 1.9x-18.8x higher throughput-per-watt compared to state-of-the-art designs of the global optical flow method.", "Distributed ledger technology (DLT) is increasingly proposed as a powerful tool to address the social and ecological challenges in the Global South. DLTs are opening up possible futures, one of which is a wave of infrastructure decentralization with common-centric and cosmo-local production. Shared logistics and supply chains for a circular economy, with collaborative and networked \"flow\" accounting allow the integration of contributive logics as well as the integration of social and ecological externalities, including practical knowledge on resource use limitations linked to planetary boundaries, as an integral part of ecosystems of productive collaboration. Indeed, DLTs remove the need for central intermediaries to validate transaction between parties, who instead place their trust in the encrypted, disintermediated system software. DLTs can be designed as a new unencloseable (non-commodifiable) medium of communication, which could lead to radically new forms of cooperation, organization, and governance. Yet these revolutionary possibilities will not be realized unless technologists consciously and strategically design systems redistributing sovereignty from elites to the people in financial, service, and national infrastructures. This paper concludes with a critical examination of the application of DLT in Puerto Rico and how DLTs could alter the production and exchange of \"value\" in service of a global popular sovereignty.", "The use of the new generation of remote sensors, such as echo sounders and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers with differential correction installed in a drone, allows the acquisition of high-precision data in areas of shallow water, as in the case of the channel of the Encanizadas in the Mar Menor lagoon. This high precision information is the first step to develop the methodology to monitor the bathymetry of the Mar Menor channels. The use of high spatial resolution satellite images is the solution for monitoring many hydrological changes and it is the basis of the three-dimensional (3D) numerical models used to study transport over time, environmental variability, and water ecosystem complexity.", "The Svalbard archipelago, with its partially closed waters influenced by both oceanic conditions and large tidal glaciers, represents a prime target for understanding the effects of ongoing climate change on glaciers, oceans, and ecosystems. An understanding of the role played by tidewater glaciers in marine primary production is still affected by a lack of data from close proximity to glacier fronts, to which, for safety reasons, manned surface vessels cannot get too close. In this context, autonomous marine vehicles can play a key role in collecting high quality data in dangerous interface areas. In particular, the contribution given by light, portable, and modular marine robots is discussed in this paper. The state-of-the-art of technology and of operating procedures is established on the basis of the experience gained in campaigns carried out by Italian National Research Council (CNR) robotic researchers in Ny-angstrom lesund, Svalbard Islands, in 2015, 2017, and 2018 respectively. The aim was to demonstrate the capability of an Unmanned Semi-Submersible Vehicle (USSV): (i) To collect water samples in contact with the front of a tidewater glacier; (ii) to work in cooperation with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) for sea surface and air column characterisation in the proximity of the fronts of the glaciers; and (iii) to perform, when equipped with suitable tools and instruments, repetitive sampling of water surface as well as profiling the parameters of the water and air column close to the fronts of the tidewater glaciers.

However, acquisition of large-scale phenotypic data has become one of the major bottlenecks hindering crop breeding and functional genomics studies. Nevertheless, recent technological advances provide us potential solutions to relieve this bottleneck and to explore advanced methods for large-scale phenotyping data acquisition and processing in the coming years. In this article, we review the major progress on high-throughput phenotyping in controlled environments and field conditions as well as its use for post-harvest yield and quality assessment in the past decades. We then discuss the latest multi-omics research combining high-throughput phenotyping with genetic studies. Finally, we propose some conceptual challenges and provide our perspectives on how to bridge the phenotype-genotype gap. It is no doubt that accurate high-throughput phenotyping will accelerate plant genetic improvements and promote the next green revolution in crop breeding.", "Reverse-engineering how complex multicellular systems develop and function is a grand challenge for systems bioengineers. This challenge has motivated the creation of a suite of bioengineering tools to develop increasingly quantitative descriptions of multicellular systems. Here, we survey a selection of these tools including microfluidic devices, imaging and computer vision techniques. We provide a selected overview of the emerging cross-talk between engineering methods and quantitative investigations within developmental biology. In particular, the review highlights selected recent examples from the Drosophila system, an excellent platform for understanding the interplay between genetics and biophysics. In sum, the integrative approaches that combine multiple advances in these fields are increasingly necessary to enable a deeper understanding of how to analyze both natural and synthetic multicellular systems.", "We propose a predictive runtime monitoring approach for linear systems with stochastic disturbances. The goal of the monitor is to decide if there exists a possible sequence of control inputs over a given time horizon to ensure that a safety property is maintained with a sufficiently high probability. We derive an efficient algorithm for performing the predictive monitoring in real time, specifically for linear time invariant (LTI) systems driven by stochastic disturbances. The algorithm implicitly defines a control envelope set such that if the current control input to the system lies in this set, there exists a future strategy over a time horizon consisting of the next N steps to guarantee the safety property of interest. As a result, the proposed monitor is oblivious of the actual controller, and therefore, applicable even in the presence of complex control systems including highly adaptive controllers. Furthermore, we apply our proposed approach to monitor whether a UAV will respect a \"geofence\" defined by a geographical region over which the vehicle may operate. To achieve this, we construct a data-driven linear model of the UAVs dynamics, while carefully modeling the uncertainties due to wind, GPS errors and modeling errors as time-varying disturbances. Using realistic data obtained from flight tests, we demonstrate the advantages and drawbacks of the predictive monitoring approach.", "The global economy is now under threat due to the ongoing domestic and international lockdown for COVID-19. Many have already lost their jobs, and businesses have been unstable in the Corona era. Apart from educational institutions, banks, privately owned institutions, and agriculture, there are signs of economic recession in almost all sectors. The roles of modern technology, the Internet of things, and artificial intelligence are undeniable in helping the world achieve economic prosperity in the post-COVID-19 economic downturn. Food production must increase by 60% by 2050 to meet global food security demands in the face of uncertainty such as the COVID-19 pandemic and a growing population. Given COVID 19's intensity and isolation, improving food production and distribution systems is critical to combating hunger and addressing the double burden of malnutrition. As the world's population is growing day by day, according to an estimation world's population reaches 9.6 billion by 2050, so there is a growing need to modify the agriculture methods, technologies so that maximum crops can be attained and human effort can be reduced. The urban smart vertical farming (USVF) is a solution to secure food production, which can be introduced at any adaptive reuse, retrofit, or new buildings in vertical manners. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the concept of USVF using various techniques to enhance productivity as well as its types, topologies, technologies, control systems, social acceptance, and benefits. This review has focused on numerous issues, challenges, and recommendations in the development of the system, vertical farming management, and modern technologies approach.", "Smart spaces are characterized by their ability to capture a holistic picture of their contextual situation. This often includes the detection of the operative states of electrical appliances, which in turn allows for the recognition of user activities and intentions. For electrical appliances with largely different power consumption characteristics, their types and operational times can be easily inferred from data collected at a single metering point (typically, a smart meter). However, a disambiguation between consumers of the same type and model, yet located in different areas of a smart building, is not possible this way. Likewise, small consumers (e.g., wall chargers) are often indiscernible from measurement noise and spurious power consumption events of other appliances. As a consequence thereof, we investigate how additional sensing modalities, i.e., data beyond electrical signals, can be leveraged to improve the appliance detection accuracy. Through a set of practical experiments, recording ambient influences in eight dimensions and testing their effects on 21 appliance types, we evaluate the importance of such added features in the context of appliance recognition. Our results show that electrical power measurements already yield a high appliance recognition accuracy, yet further accuracy improvements are possible when considering ambient parameters as well.", "Emotion recognition based on electroencephalography (EEG) signal features is now one of the booming big data research areas.

Additionally, a comparison with researchgrade devices is conducted. This paper also highlights EEG-based emotion recognition research's key areas, including different feature extraction capabilities, characteristics, and machine learning algorithms. Finally, the main challenges for building an EEG-based emotion recognition system, focusing on the data collection process with commercial EEG devices and machine learning algorithms' performance, are presented.

Many generations of do-it-yourself network efforts that are either wireless, such as community mesh networks, or wired, such as fiber cooperatives, exist, but in the United States scaled developments have been stalled for a variety of reasons. This research examines the history of local connectivity efforts as well as technologies designed to cultivate sharing or commons organizational approaches. By exploring instances of community-based or -oriented networking efforts, we identify some of the noneconomic benefits that might be realized with certain technologies and organizational and governance structures. Technological, social, regulatory and economic logics that have shaped historical opportunities for local responses to connectivity needs in the U.S. are not necessarily inevitable; alternative approaches do exist. Improved social and technical outcomes for connectivity may be possible, especially when catalyzed by supportive policies.", "Newsroom developers often share code produced by their organizations within open source software (OSS) environments.

The manufacturing process can be completed in less than 6 h making it a viable technique for testing new designs quickly. The technique is validated by creating a microfluidic device with channels of height and depth of 300 mu m, with a ramp test structure where the height and width of the channels reduces to 100 mu m to demonstrate the techniques 3D capabilities. The resulting PDMS device was easily removed from the metallic mould and closely replicated the shape aside the expected shrinkage during thermal curing. As the technique uses a single replica process, the surface roughness at the base of the channels corresponds to the un-ablated polished metal mould, resulting in a very low surface roughness of 0.361 nm. The ablated metallic mould surface corresponds to the top of the PDMS device, which is bonded to glass and does not affect the flow within the channels, reducing the need for optimisation of laser parameters. Finally, the device is validated by demonstrating laminar flow with the no-slip condition.", "COVID-19 has impacted not only the health of citizens, but also the various factors that make up our society, living environments, and ecosystems. This pandemic has shown that future living will need to be agile and flexible to adapt to the various changes in needs of societal populations. Digital technology has played an integral role during COVID-19, assisting various sectors of the community, and demonstrating that smart cities can provide opportunities to respond to many future societal challenges. In the decades ahead, the rise in aging populations will be one of these challenges, and one in which the needs and requirements between demographic cohorts will vary greatly. Although we need to create future smart age-friendly ecosystems to meet these needs, technology still does not feature in the WHO eight domains of an age-friendly city. This paper extends upon Marston and van Hoof's 'Smart Age-friendly Ecosystem' (SAfE) framework, and explores how digital technology, design hacking, and research approaches can be used to understand a smart age-friendly ecosystem in a post-pandemic society. By exploring a series of case studies and using real-life scenarios from the standpoint of COVID-19, we propose the 'Concept of Age-friendly Smart Ecologies (CASE)' framework. We provide an insight into a myriad of contemporary multi-disciplinary research, which are capable to initiate discussions and bring various actors together with a positive impact on future planning and development of age-friendly ecosystems. The strengths and limitations of this framework are outlined, with advantages evident in the opportunity for towns, regions/counties, provinces, and states to take an agile approach and work together in adopting and implement improvements for the greater benefits of residents and citizens.", "We look at the opportunities presented by the new concepts of generic programmable photonic integrated circuits (PIC) to deploy photonics on a larger scale. Programmable PICs consist of waveguide meshes of tunable couplers and phase shifters that can be reconfigured in software to define diverse functions and arbitrary connectivity between the input and output ports. Off-the-shelf programmable PICs can dramatically shorten the development time and deployment costs of new photonic products, as they bypass the design-fabrication cycle of a custom PIC. These chips, which actually consist of an entire technology stack of photonics, electronics packaging and software, can potentially be manufactured cheaper and in larger volumes than application-specific PICs. We look into the technology requirements of these generic programmable PICs and discuss the economy of scale. Finally, we make a qualitative analysis of the possible application spaces where generic programmable PICs can play an enabling role, especially to companies who do not have an in-depth background in PIC technology.", "Fluorescence live-cell imaging allows for continuous interrogation of cellular behaviors, and the recent development of portable live-cell imaging platforms has rapidly transformed conventional schemes with high adaptability, cost-effective functionalities and easy accessibility to cell-based assays. However, broader applications remain restrictive due to compatibility with conventional cell culture workflow and biochemical sensors, accessibility to up-right physiological imaging, or parallelization of data acquisition. Here, we introduce miniaturized modular-array fluorescence microscopy (MAM) for compact live-cell imaging in flexible formats. We advance the current miniscopy technology to devise an up-right modular architecture, each combining a gradient-index (GRIN) objective and individually-addressed illumination and acquisition components. Parallelization of an array of such modular devices allows for multi-site data acquisition in situ using conventional off-the-shelf cell chambers. Compared with existing methods, the device offers a high fluorescence sensitivity and efficiency, exquisite spatiotemporal resolution (similar to 3 mu m and up to 60 Hz), a configuration compatible with conventional cell culture assays and physiological imaging, and an effective parallelization of data acquisition.

However, proprietary business intelligence suite solutions supporting the production of decision-making information requires investment that is out of reach of small and medium-sized healthcare facilities or those with limited resources, particularly in developing countries. This paper describes our experience in designing and implementing a real-time healthcare monitoring system solution to manage healthcare emergency units. Methods: Through the use of free Business Intelligence tools and Python data science language we designed a real-time monitoring system, which was implemented to explore the Electronic Medical Records system of a university mental health emergency unit and render an electronic dashboard to support health professional daily practice. Results: Three main dashboards were created to monitor patient waiting time, to access the clinical notes summary for the next waiting patient, and to obtain insights into activity during the last 24 hours. Conclusions: The designed system could serve as a monitoring support model using free and user-friendly data science tools, which are good alternatives to proprietary business intelligence solutions and drastically reduce cost. Still, the key to success in decision-making systems is based on investment in human resources, business intelligence skills training, the organizational aspect of the decision-making process, and data production quality insurance.", "Polypropylene (PP) powder is treated in a fluidized bed reactor with an atmospheric Ar/O-2 plasma jet to investigate the influence of the plasma treatment on the coloring of the powders.

The plasma treatment contributes to a significant improvement of the dispersibility and coloring of PP. Powder bulk properties such as particle size distribution and flowability were not modified by the process. Effects of the plasma treatment on the material bulk properties are also negligible.", "Solar energy is a sustainable and inexhaustible renewable energy. Solar-powered PV systems contribute to the cleanest and the most cost-effective electrical energy. However, PV systems are confronted with a nonlinear maximum power point tracking (MPPT) problem caused by partial shading (PS). PS causes the loss of available power. This paper presents a novel Harris hawk optimization (HHO) based MPPT controller to effectively track maximum power under all weather conditions. The effectiveness of the proposed HHO based MPPT is supplemented by a comparative study with perturb and observe algorithm (P&O), dragonfly optimization algorithm (DFOA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), cuckoo search (CS) and grey wolf optimization (GWO). The analytical and statistical analysis is made based on 4 different cases, including fast varying irradiance, PS, complex-PS (CPS), and field atmospheric data of Hefei city of China, to solidify the effectiveness of HHO based MPPT for PV systems in real-world applications. The proposed HHO shows superior performance in tracking maximum power point and faster convergence at the global maximum power point. The improvement of 10-30% in tracking time and more than 90% in random oscillations are effectively achieved by the proposed MPPT technique. Faster maximum power point (MPP) tracking, lower computational burden and higher efficiency are the key contributions of the HHO based MPPT technique. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

A more precise characterization of the environment will allow a better dealing with genotype-by-environment-by-management interactions. Therefore, space and time dependencies of the crop production processes have to be considered. The use of novel sensor technologies has drastically increased the amount and diversity of phenotypic data from agronomic field trials. Existing data management systems either do not consider space and time, are not customizable to individual needs such as field trial handling, or have restricted availability. Hence, we propose an integrative data management and information system (DMIS) for handling of traditional and novel sensor-based phenotypic, environmental and management data. The DMIS must be customizable, applicable and scalable from individual users to organizations. Results Key element of the system is a dynamic PostgreSQL database with GIS-extension, capable of importing, storing and managing all types of data including images. The database references every structural database object and measurement in a threefold approach with semantic, spatial and temporal reference. Timestamps and geo-coordinates allow automated linking of all data. Traits can be precisely defined individually or uploaded as predefined lists. Filtering and selection routines allow compilation of all data for visualization via tables, charts or maps and for export and external statistical analysis. New possibilities of environmental information-based planning of field trials, weather-guided phenotyping and data analysis for outlier or hot-spot detection are demonstrated. Conclusions The DMIS supports users in handling experimental field trials with crop plants and modern phenotyping methods. It focuses on linking all space and time dependent processes of plant production. Weather, soil and management, as well as growth and yield formation of the plants can be depicted, thus allowing a more precise interpretation of the results in relation to environment and management.

Passive acoustics, particularly from autonomous vehicles, is a promising approach to meeting this need. We have previously developed the capability to record, detect, classify, and transmit to shore information about the tonal sounds of baleen whales in near real time from long-endurance ocean gliders. We have recently developed a protocol by which a human analyst reviews this information to determine the presence of marine mammals, and the results of this review are automatically posted to a publicly accessible website, sent directly to interested parties via email or text, and made available to stakeholders via a number of public and private digital applications. We evaluated the performance of this system during two 3.75-month Slocum glider deployments in the southwestern Gulf of Maine during the spring seasons of 2015 and 2016. Near real-time detections of humpback, fin, sei, and North Atlantic right whales were compared to detections of these species from simultaneously recorded audio. Data from another 2016 glider deployment in the same area were also used to compare results between three different analysts to determine repeatability of results both among and within analysts. False detection (occurrence) rates on daily time scales were 0% for all species. Daily missed detection rates ranged from 17 to 24%. Agreement between two trained novice analysts and an experienced analyst was greater than 95% for fin, sei, and right whales, while agreement was 83-89% for humpback whales owing to the more subjective process for detecting this species. Our results indicate that the presence of baleen whales can be accurately determined using information about tonal sounds transmitted in near real-time from Slocum gliders. The system is being used operationally to monitor baleen whales in United States, Canadian, and Chilean waters, and has been particularly useful for monitoring the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale throughout the northwestern Atlantic Ocean.", "Frequent and accurate inspections of industrial components and equipment are essential because failures can cause unscheduled downtimes, massive material, and financial losses or even endanger workers. In the mining industry, belt idlers or rollers are examples of such critical components. Although there are many precise laboratory techniques to assess the condition of a roller, companies still have trouble implementing a reliable and scalable procedure to inspect their field assets. This article enumerates and discusses the existing roller inspection techniques and presents a novel approach based on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) integrated with a thermal imaging camera. Our preliminary results indicate that using a signal processing technique, we are able to identify roller failures automatically. We also proposed and implemented a back-end platform that enables field and cloud connectivity with enterprise systems. Finally, we have also cataloged the anomalies detected during the extensive field tests in order to build a structured dataset that will allow for future experimentation.", "Biological neuronal cells communicate using neurochemistry and electrical signals. The same phenomena also allow us to probe and manipulate neuronal systems and communicate with them. Neuronal system malfunctions cause a multitude of symptoms and functional deficiencies that can be assessed and sometimes alleviated by electrical stimulation. Our working hypothesis is that real-time closed-loop full-duplex measurement and stimulation paradigms can provide more in-depth insight into neuronal networks and enhance our capability to control diseases of the nervous system. In this study, we review extracellular electrical stimulation methods used in in vivo, in vitro, and in silico neuroscience research and in the clinic (excluding methods mainly aimed at neuronal growth and other similar effects) and highlight the potential of closed-loop measurement and stimulation systems. A multitude of electrical stimulation and measurement-based methods are widely used in research and the clinic. Closed-loop methods have been proposed, and some are used in the clinic. However, closed-loop systems utilizing more complex measurement analysis and adaptive stimulation systems, such as artificial intelligence systems connected to biological neuronal systems, do not yet exist. Our review promotes the research and development of intelligent paradigms aimed at meaningful communications between neuronal and information and communications technology systems, \"dialogical paradigms,\" which have the potential to take neuroscience and clinical methods to a new level.", "Phased array transducers (PATs) are used in many applications, from airborne ultrasonic tactile displays to acoustic levitation. Acoustic holograms play a significant role in determining the performance of these applications. Many PATs and optimizers have been developed; however, only the following have been demonstrated in the literature: \"phase\" and \"phase and amplitude\" control of transducers and \"phase\" and \"amplitude\" only control at target points. Thus, most of the combinations of transducer state and target acoustic field conditions are yet to be explored. Here, we explore such combinations using Diff-PAT, one of the latest acoustic hologram optimizers. Diff-PAT is based on automatic differentiation and stochastic gradient descent. This optimizer achieves higher accuracy than conventional optimizers. We formulated multiple loss functions and wave propagators to enable each combination of the operation mode and quantitatively assessed the performance of each combination. The developed optimizers will offer new opportunities in the field and could allow further simplifications in PAT applications.(c) 2021 Author(s).

As recent advances in electronics, rapid prototyping and unmanned-vehicle technologies expand its capabilities and lower its cost, this experimental method is seeing growing interest across academia and the industry. However, subscale models cannot meet all similarity conditions required for simulating full-scale flight. This leads to a variety of approaches to scaling and to other alternative applications. Through a literature review and analysis of different scaling strategies, this study presents an overall picture of how subscale flight testing has been used in recent years and synthesises its main issues and practical limitations. Results show that, while the estimation of full-scale characteristics is still an interesting application within certain flight conditions, subscale models are progressively taking a broader role as low-cost technology-testing platforms with relaxed similarity constraints. Different approaches to tackle the identified practical challenges, implemented both by the authors and by other organisations, are discussed and evaluated through flight experiments.", "To be competitive in Industry 4.0, small scale and traditional industries, such as bread companies, must be equipped with engineering tools and technologies for empowering food processing and product quality.

Mirror mounts made of different polymers are examined and compared with each other. The mechanical stress induced into the imprinted optic is determined. Regarding the 3D-printed spring system, the angular alignment range as well as the load limits are defined. The reproducibility of the mirror's angular position and the long-term stability together with the influence of thermal cycling is determined.

In this study, we adapted a well-established, robust TRIzol-based RNA extraction protocol into a high-throughput format through miniaturization and automation. The workflow was validated by RT-qPCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection to illustrate its scalability without interference to downstream diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy. This semi-automated, kit-free approach offers a versatile alternative to prevailing integrated solid-phase RNA extraction proprietary systems, with the added advantage of improved cost-effectiveness for high volume acquisition of quality RNA whether for use in clinical diagnoses or for diverse molecular applications.", "Beer is one of the most popular beverages worldwide. As a product of variable agricultural ingredients and processes, beer has high molecular complexity. We used DIA/SWATH-MS to investigate the proteomic complexity and diversity of 23 commercial Australian beers. While the overall complexity of the beer proteome was modest, with contributions from barley and yeast proteins, we uncovered a very high diversity of post-translational modifications (PTMs), especially proteolysis, glycation, and glycosylation. Proteolysis was widespread throughout barley proteins, but showed clear site-specificity. Oligohexose modifications were common on lysines in barley proteins, consistent with glycation by maltooligosaccharides released from starch during malting or mashing. O-glycosylation consistent with oligomannose was abundant on secreted yeast glycoproteins. We developed and used data analysis pipelines to efficiently extract and quantify site-specific PTMs from SWATH-MS data, and showed incorporating these features into proteomic analyses extended analytical precision. We found that the key differentiator of the beer glyco/proteome was the brewery, with beer from independent breweries having a distinct profile to beer from multinational breweries. Within a given brewery, beer styles also had distinct glyco/proteomes. Targeting our analyses to beers from a single brewery, Newstead Brewing Co., allowed us to identify beer style-specific features of the glyco/proteome. Specifically, we found that proteins in darker beers tended to have low glycation and high proteolysis. Finally, we objectively quantified features of foam formation and stability, and showed that these quality properties correlated with the concentration of abundant surface-active proteins from barley and yeast.", "It is very important for the brain study to design a multi-channel and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) bio-medical signal capture, record, and analysis system, which can effectively enhance accuracy and precision of the signal capture under dozens to hundreds of microvolts. Unfortunately, the system for data acquisition is very easily interfered by the environment, the power, and the bio-amplifier, so that the results will lead to a failed promotion of capturing high SNR signals, especially in the tiny brain wave signal. In this study, it has been designed an inexpensive, purpose-built, high SNR brainwave signals measurement system. The system is composed of an improved capture system, record system, and analysis system. To better consider the strength and characteristics of the tiny brainwave signals, the system was designed to include a suitable bio-amplifier to make each channel of the invasive microelectrode able to collect the brainwave signals correctly and it provides recording and analysis software, which can not only extract the characteristics of brainwave signals, but also quickly classify signals. The system can collect biological signals from 10 mu V to 420 mu V and has a high SNR>30. The proposed system is easy to make and can be fabricated for the relatively low cost of only US$203. The brain wave signals from the three actions can also be easily classified, with a correct rate up to 46.70%. The system has six improvements: good SNR, the ability to capture small signals, modularity, a low price, easy fabrication, and simple operation.", null, null, "A real-time irrigation scheduling system (ISS) for greenhouses has been developed in compliance with the ISO/IEC/IEEE 21451 standard. The developed system is capable of displaying greenhouse and irrigation scheduling parameters. Irrigation can wirelessly be automated by the sensor node by activating irrigation based on sensor values and predefined irrigation parameters. A low power sensor node was developed to record greenhouse conditions, measuring soil moisture, light, CO2, temperature, and humidity. The sensor node wirelessly sends all measured data to a graphical user interface application running on a server. All data received by the GUI is stored within a MySQL database for history and statistical purposes.

This has made them very popular for various military and civilian applications allowing us to reach places that were previously hard to reach in addition to saving time and lives. A highly desirable direction when developing unmanned aerial vehicles is towards achieving fully autonomous missions and performing their dedicated tasks with minimum human interaction. Thus, this paper provides a survey of some of the recent developments in the field of unmanned aerial vehicles related to safe autonomous navigation, which is a very critical component in the whole system.

Face shields are an important component of PPE for front-line workers in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, providing protection of the face from splashes and sprays of virus-containing fluids. Existing face shield designs and manufacturing procedures may not allow for production and distribution of face shields in sufficient volume to meet global demand, particularly in Low and Middle-Income countries. This paper presents a simple, fast, and cost-effective curved-crease origami technique for transforming flat sheets of flexible plastic material into face shields for infection control. It is further shown that the design could be produced using a variety of manufacturing methods, ranging from manual techniques to high-volume die-cutting and creasing. This demonstrates the potential for the design to be applied in a variety of contexts depending on available materials, manufacturing capabilities and labour. An easily implemented and flexible physical-digital parametric design methodology for rapidly exploring and refining variations on the design is presented, potentially allowing others to adapt the design to accommodate a wide range of ergonomic and protection requirements.", ["Featured Application", "Field phytoremediation with willow shrub (Salix spp.).", "The Salix genus includes shrub species that are widely used in phytoremediation and various other phytotechnologies due to their advantageous characteristics, such as a high evapotranspiration (ET) rate, in particular when cultivated in short rotation intensive culture (SRIC). Observations made in past field studies suggest that ET and its impact on soil hydrology can also lead to increases in soil pollutant concentrations near shrubs. To investigate this, sections of a mature willow plantation (seven years old) were cut to eliminate transpiration (Cut treatment). Soil concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), aliphatic compounds C10-C50, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and five trace elements (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni and Zn) were compared between the Cut and the uncut plots (Salix miyabeana 'SX61'). Over 24 months, the results clearly show that removal of the willow shrubs limited the contaminants' increase in the soil surface, as observed for C10-C50 and of 10 PAHs under the Salix treatment. This finding strongly reinforces a hypothesis that SRIC of willows may facilitate the migration of contaminants towards their roots, thus increasing their concentration in the surrounding soil. Such a \"pumping effect\" in a high-density willow crop is a prominent characteristic specific to field studies that can lead to counterintuitive results. Although apparent increases of contaminant concentrations contradict the purification benefits usually pursued in phytoremediation, the possibility of active phytoextraction and rhizodegradation is not excluded. Moreover, increases of pollutant concentrations under shrubs following migration suggest that decreases would consequently occur at the source points. Some reflections on interpreting field work results are provided."], "A haptic interface recreates haptic feedback from virtual environments or haptic teleoperation systems that engages the user's sense of touch. High-fidelity haptic feedback is critical to the safety and success of any interaction with human beings. Such interactions can be seen in haptic systems utilized in medical fields, such as for surgical training, robotic tele-surgery, and tele-rehabilitation, which require appropriate haptic interface design and control. In order to recreate high-fidelity soft and stiff contact experiences for the user in the intended application, different designs strike different trade-offs between the desirable characteristics of an interface, such as back-drivability, low apparent inertia and low friction for the best perception of small reflected forces, large intrinsic stiffness and force feedback capability for the best perception of large reflected forces, a large-enough workspace for exploring the remote or virtual environment, and the uniformity of haptic feedback and its adequate sensitivity over the workspace. Meeting all of the requirements simultaneously is impossible, and different application-driven compromises need to be made. This paper reviews how various kinematic designs have helped address these trade-offs in desired specifications. First, we investigate the required characteristics of linkage-based haptic interfaces and inevitable trade-offs between them. Then, we study the state of the art in the kinematic design of haptic interfaces and their advantages and limitations. In all sections, we consider the applications of the intended haptic interfaces in medical scenarios. Non-linkage-based haptic interfaces are also shortly discussed to show the broad range of haptic technologies in the area. The potentials of kinematic redundancy to address the design trade-offs are introduced. Current challenges and future directions of haptic interface designs for medical applications are shortly discussed, which is finally followed by the conclusion.", "This paper deals with the potentialities for do-it-yourself (DIY) labs to open up the research and innovation system to citizen participation. DIY labs are spaces where academics and civil society stakeholders can gather to experiment with alternative research and innovation practices. I hypothesize that these collaborative practices are facilitated by intermediations. My results draw on the literature and on extensive field work in French DIY labs, also called fablabs, (bio)hackerspaces, makerspaces or third places. First, I discuss the relationship between DIY labs, epistemic communities and citizen participation. Second, I compare two situations of collaborative practices in maker communities. I show that managing the inclusion of non-experts in these technology-oriented communities requires a set of activities which need to be coordinated by an intermediary agent and are often distributed among community members. Third, I conclude that intermediations play a key role in transforming technology-centered into socio-centered DIY labs. In socio-centered set-ups, technical experts and practitioners from the groups concerned (users, patients, residents, etc.), collaborate thanks to intermediary agents. Intermediations are a pre-requisite for DIY labs to open up the research and innovation system to civil society.", "Solar energy is vast, abundant, cost free, green renewable source of energy.

It mainly focuses on the design and performance analysis of the various dual-axis tracking solar systems proposed in recent years. Although the choice on the use of trackers mainly depends upon the physical features of the land but in general this system has proved to be more efficient and advantageous than its single-axis and fixed counterparts.

The tilted particleboard allows testing without standing waves between the transmitter and the particleboard. This eliminates the need to evaluate several parallel planes and to search for values belonging to the tilted particleboard. The numerical requirements can be optimally exploited through a combination with a flaw detectability enhancement method. The results are supported by experiments on a wooden particleboard with flaw imitations. Finally, we showed, through a comparison with the usual procedure of identifying a flaw (calculating many parallel planes and then selecting the data belonging to the tilted plane), that the calculation of the tilted plane is up to 98.5% faster and improves the detectability of flaws in a tilted particleboard.", "The restoration of a useful visual sense in a profoundly blind person by direct electrical stimulation of the visual cortex has been a subject of study for many years. However, the field of cortically based sight restoration has made few advances in the last few decades, and many problems remain. In this context, the scientific and technological problems associated with safe and effective communication with the brain are very complex, and there are still many unresolved issues delaying its development. In this work, we review some of the biological and technical issues that still remain to be solved, including long-term biotolerability, the number of electrodes required to provide useful vision, and the delivery of information to the implants. Furthermore, we emphasize the possible role of the neuroplastic changes that follow vision loss in the success of this approach. We propose that increased collaborations among clinicians, basic researchers, and neural engineers will enhance our ability to send meaningful information to the brain and restore a limited but useful sense of vision to many blind individuals.", "The host identity protocol (HIP) has emerged as the most suitable solution to uniquely identify smart devices in the mobile and distributed Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems, such as smart cities, homes, cars, and healthcare. The HIP provides authentication methods that enable secure communications between HIP peers. However, the authentication methods provided by the HIP cannot be adopted by the IoT devices with limited processing power because of the computation-intensive cryptographic operations involved in hash generation, signature validation, and session-key establishment. Moreover, IoT devices cannot utilize the HIP as is to communicate securely in the low power and lossy networks as there is a considerable communication overhead, such as packet fragmentation and reassembly, for exchanging certificates over a lossy link. Additionally, the use of static host identifiers makes IoT devices vulnerable to cyber espionage and user-targeted attacks. In this article, we propose an authentication scheme, P-HIP, that protects the identity privacy of an IoT device by enabling the device to compute and use unique host identifiers from networks to networks and sessions to sessions. To make the HIP suitable for resource-constrained IoT devices, P-HIP provides methods that unburden IoT devices from computation-intensive operations, such as modular exponentiation, involved in authentication and session-key exchange. Additionally, P-HIP minimizes the communication overheads for exchanging certificates in lossy networks. We implement a prototype of P-HIP on Contiki-enabled IoT that shows P-HIP can reduce computation costs, communication overheads, and the session-key establishment time when used by low-powered devices in a lossy network.", "Each of us is a unique individual despite carrying almost the same genetic information as anyone else. Zooming in into our body, we find the same pattern: all cells share the same genome, and yet they look and behave differently. The process of gene expression is the reason behind this fascinating phenomenon whereby the same genome is translated in different sets of molecules being present in the cell at any given time. The ability to precisely control this process endows researchers with great power, not only for basic science purposes but also for biotechnological and biomedical applications. In this review, we will discuss the current arsenal of tools that consent to control gene expression using light as the external trigger. These tools are, in most cases, preferable to those based on chemical triggers owing to the many favorable properties of light, foremost its spatial confineability and easy removal.", "Single-cell manipulation, sorting, and dispensing into multiwell plates is useful for single-cell multiomics studies. Here, we develop a single-cell dispenser inspired by electrohydrodynamic jet printing that achieves accurate droplet generation and single-cell sorting and dispensing using fused silica capillary tubing as both the optical detection window and nozzle for droplet dispensing. Parameters that affect droplet dispensing performance-capillary inner and outer diameter, flow rate, applied voltage, and solution properties-were optimized systematically with COMSOL simulations and experimentation. Small (5-10 nL) droplets were obtained by using 100-mu m inner diameter and 160-mu m outer diameter capillary tubing and allowed efficient encapsulation and dispensing of single cells. We demonstrate an application of this easy-to-assemble single-cell dispenser by sorting and dispensing cells into multiwell plates for single-cell PCR analysis.", "Objective. Unobtrusive electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring in everyday life requires the availability of highly miniaturized EEG devices (mini-EEGs), which ideally consist of a wireless node with a small scalp area footprint, in which the electrodes, amplifier and wireless radio are embedded. By attaching a multitude of mini-EEGs at relevant positions on the scalp, a wireless 'EEG sensor network' (WESN) can be formed. However, each mini-EEG in the network only has access to its own local electrodes, thereby recording local scalp potentials with short inter-electrode distances. This is unlike using traditional cap-EEG, which by the virtue of re-referencing can measure EEG across arbitrarily large distances on the scalp. We evaluate the implications and limitations of such far-driven miniaturization on neural decoding performance. Approach. We collected 255-channel EEG data in an auditory attention decoding (AAD) task. As opposed to previous studies with a lower channel density, this new high-density dataset allows emulation of mini-EEGs with inter-electrode distances down to 1 cm in order to identify and quantify the lower bound on miniaturization for EEG-based stimulus decoding. Main results. We demonstrate that the performance remains reasonably stable for inter-electrode distances down to 3 cm, but decreases quickly for shorter distances if the mini-EEG nodes can be placed at optimal scalp locations and orientations selected by a data-driven algorithm. Significance. The results indicate the potential for the use of mini-EEGs in a WESN context for AAD applications and provide guidance on inter-electrode distances while designing such devices for neuro-steered hearing devices.", "In this paper we present a mixture of technologies tailored for e-learning related to the Deep Learning, Sentiment Analysis, and Semantic Web domains, which we have employed to show four different use cases that we have validated in the field of Human-Robot Interaction. The approach has been designed using Zora, a humanoid robot that can be easily extended with new software behaviors. The goal is to make the robot able to engage users through natural language for different tasks. Using our software the robot can (i) talk to the user and understand their sentiments through a dedicated Semantic Sentiment Analysis engine; (ii) answer to open-dialog natural language utterances by means of a Generative Conversational Agent; (iii) perform action commands leveraging a defined Robot Action ontology and open-dialog natural language utterances; and (iv) detect which objects the user is handing by using convolutional neural networks trained on a huge collection of annotated objects. Each module can be extended with more data and information and the overall architectural design is general, flexible, and scalable and can be expanded with other components, thus enriching the interaction with the human. Different applications within the e-learning domains are foreseen: The robot can either be a trainer and autonomously perform physical actions (e.g., in rehabilitation centers) or it can interact with the users (performing simple tests or even identifying emotions) according to the program developed by the teachers.", "The response of the antenna is a source of uncertainty in measurements with the Experiment to Detect the Global Epoch of Reionization Signature (EDGES). We aim to validate the electromagnetic beam model of the low-band (50-100 MHz) dipole antenna with comparisons between models and against data. We find that simulations of a simplified model of the antenna over an infinite perfectly conducting ground plane are, with one exception, robust to changes in the numerical electromagnetic solver code or algorithm. For simulations of the antenna with the actual finite ground plane and realistic soil properties, we find that two out of three numerical solvers agree well. Applying our analysis pipeline to a simulated drift-scan observation from an early EDGES low-band instrument that had a 10 m x 10 m ground plane, we find residual levels after fitting and removing a five-term foreground model from the simulated data binned in local sidereal time (LST) average about 250 mK with +/- 40 mK variation between numerical solvers. A similar analysis of the primary 30 m x 30 m sawtooth ground plane reduced the LST-averaged residuals to about 90 mK with +/- 10 mK between the two viable solvers. More broadly we show that larger ground planes generally perform better than smaller ground planes. Simulated data have a power that is within 4% of real observations, a limitation of net accuracy of the sky and beam models. We observe that residual spectral structures after foreground model fits match qualitatively between simulated data and observations, suggesting that the frequency dependence of the beam is reasonably represented by the models. We find that a soil conductivity of 0.02 S m(-1) and relative permittivity of 3.5 yield good agreement between simulated spectra and observations. This is consistent with the soil properties reported by Sutinjo et al. for the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory, where EDGES is located.", ["Purpose", "The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in numerous innovative engineering design solutions, several of which leverage the rapid prototyping and manufacturing capabilities of additive manufacturing.

Recent advancements have enabled low-power passive acoustic systems to be integrated into long-endurance autonomous platforms for persistent near real-time monitoring of marine mammals via the sounds they produce. Here, the integration of a passive acoustic instrument capable of real-time detection and classification of low-frequency (LF) tonal sounds with a Liquid Robotics wave glider is reported. The goal of the integration was to enable monitoring of LF calls produced by baleen whales over periods of several months. Mechanical noises produced by the platform were significantly reduced by lubricating moving parts with polytetrafluoroethylene, incorporating rubber and springs to decelerate moving parts and shock mounting hydrophones. Flow noise was reduced with the development of a 21-element hydrophone array. Surface noise produced by breaking waves was not mitigated despite experimentation with baffles. Compared to a well-characterized moored passive acoustic monitoring buoy, the system greatly underestimated the occurrence of sei, fin, and North Atlantic right whales during a 37-d deployment, and therefore is not suitable in its current configuration for use in scientific or management applications for these species at this time.", "This study introduces a novel strategy that can determine the optimal values of control parameters of a PSO. These optimal control parameters will be very valuable to all the online optimization problems where the convergence time and the failure convergence rate are vital concerns. The newly proposed strategy uses two nested PSO (NESTPSO) searching loops; the inner one contained the original objective function, and the outer one used the inner PSO as a fitness function. The control parameters and the swarm size acted as the optimization variables for the outer loop. These variables were optimized for the lowest premature convergence rate, the lowest number of iterations, and the lowest swarm size. The new proposed strategy can be used for all the swarm optimization techniques as well. The results showed the superiority of the proposed NESTPSO control parameter determination when compared with several state of the art PSO strategies.", "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become continually deeper. With the increasing depth of CNNs, the invalid calculations caused by padding-zero operations, filling-zero operations and stride length (stride length>1) represent an increasing proportion of all calculations. To adapt to different CNNs and to eliminate the influences of padding-zero operations, filling-zero operations and stride length on the computational efficiency of the accelerator, we draw upon the computation pattern of CPUs to design an efficient and versatile CNN accelerator, LACS (Loading-Addressing-Computing-Storing). We reduce the amount of data movements between registers and the on-chip buffer from O(k x k) to O(k) by a bypass buffer mechanism. Finally, we deploy LACS on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chip and analyze the factors that affect the computational efficiency of LACS.We also run popular CNNs on LACS. The results show that LACS achieves an extremely high computational efficiency, 98.51% when executing AlexNet and 99.66% when executing VGG-16, significantly exceeding state-of-the-art accelerators.", "In this article, we investigate the problem of controlling a multirobot team to follow a leader in formation, supported by a relative position estimate derived from distance and self-displacement measurements, thus waiving the need of external localization infrastructure. The main challenge of the problem, which is to simultaneously fulfill both relative localization and control tasks, is efficiently and novelly resolved by embedding a distance-displacement-based persistently excited adaptive relative localization technique into a time-varying formation with bounded control input (PEARL-TVF). By assuming that the leader is globally reachable and by selecting proper parameters, it is shown that the PEARL-TVF ensures exponentially convergent localization, which leads to exponentially convergent formation when the leader's behavior is deterministic, and bounded formation error for a nondeterministic leader. Numerical simulations and experiments on quadcopters are provided to verify the theoretical findings.", "Beverages is a broad and important category within the food industry, which is comprised of a wide range of sub-categories and types of drinks with different levels of complexity for their manufacturing and quality assessment.

Therefore, there is a need to test and implement emerging technologies in order to automate and facilitate those analyses within this industry. This paper aimed to present the most recent publications and trends regarding the use of low-cost, reliable, and accurate, remote or non-contact techniques using robotics, machine learning, computer vision, biometrics and the application of artificial intelligence, as well as to identify the research gaps within the beverage industry. It was found that there is a wide opportunity in the development and use of robotics and biometrics for all types of beverages, but especially for hot and non-alcoholic drinks. Furthermore, there is a lack of knowledge and clarity within the industry, and research about the concepts of artificial intelligence and machine learning, as well as that concerning the correct design and interpretation of modeling related to the lack of inclusion of relevant data, additional to presenting over- or under-fitted models.", "In this work, a new pre-tuning multivariable PID (Proportional Integral Derivative) controllers method for quadrotors is put forward. A procedure based on LQR/LQG (Linear Quadratic Regulator/Gaussian) theory is proposed for attitude and altitude control, which suposes a considerable simplification of the design problem due to only one pretuning parameter being used. With the aim to analyze the performance and robustness of the proposed method, a non-linear mathematical model of the DJI-F450 quadrotor is employed, where rotors dynamics, together with sensors drift/bias properties and noise characteristics of low-cost commercial sensors typically used in this type of applications are considered. In order to estimate the state vector and compensate bias/drift effects in the measures, a combination of filtering and data fusion algorithms (Kalman filter and Madgwick algorithm for attitude estimation) are proposed and implemented. Performance and robustness analysis of the control system is carried out by employing numerical simulations, which take into account the presence of uncertainty in the plant model and external disturbances. The obtained results show the proposed controller design method for multivariable PID controller is robust with respect to: (a) parametric uncertainty in the plant model, (b) disturbances acting at the plant input, (c) sensors measurement and estimation errors.", "This article examines bots - software applications that automate web-based tasks, and which often mimic human interaction and communication - to consider sociological responses to software design and computer programming. Leveraging design methodologies for critical sociological purposes (a) allows us to envision programming as a means of opening up 'black boxes' by engaging more directly with the code through which software applications are executed, and (b) indicates the potential for sociology practitioners to design software ourselves - to build applications that fulfil the radical promise of sociology by intervening in social processes. To concretise these ideas, this article presents two stories about social media bots developed by the author: 'Philbot' (a Facebook random status generator) and '' (a Twitter service that provides mock lifestyle advice to users). On the basis of this demonstration, the article proposes a near-future vision of sociology where Programming-as-Social-Science features as a core research method/skill/tool.", "This paper details the development of an acoustically adaptive modular system capable of enhancing Speech Clarity (C-50 Clarity Index) in specific locations within a space in near real-time. The mechanical component of the system consists of quadrilateral, truncated pyramidal modules that extend or retract perpendicularly to their base. This enables said modules (1) to change in the steepness of the sides of their frustum, which changes the way incoming sound waves are deflected/reflected/diffused by the surfaces of the pyramid; and (2) to reveal or to hide the absorbent material under each module, which enables a portion of incoming sound waves to be absorbed/dissipated in a controlled manner. The present setup considers a fragmentary implementation of six modules. The behavior of these modules is determined by two steps in the computational component of the system. First, the initial position of the modules is set via a model previously generated by an evolutionary solver, which identifies the optimal extension/retraction extent of each of the six modules to select for individual configurations that collectively ascertain the highest clarity in said specific locations. Second, a simulated receiver at the location in question measures the actual clarity attained and updates the model's database with respect to the configuration's corresponding clarity-value. Since the nature of acoustics is not exact, if the attained measurement is lower than the model's prediction for said location under the best module-configuration, but higher than the second-best configuration for the same location, the modules remain at the initial configuration. However, if the attained values are lower, this step reconfigures the modules to instantiate the second-or third-, fourth-, etc.-best configuration and updates the model's database with respect to the new optimal module-configuration value. These steps repeat each time the user moves to another specific location. The objective of the system is to contribute to the intelligent and intuitive Speech Clarity regulation of an inhabited space. This contributes to its Interior Environmental Quality, which promotes well-being and quality of life.", "Robots can provide assistance to a human by moving objects to locations around the person's body. With a well-chosen initial configuration, a robot can better reach locations important to an assistive task despite model error, pose uncertainty, and other sources of variation. However, finding effective configurations can be challenging due to complex geometry, a large number of degrees of freedom, task complexity, and other factors. We present task-centric optimization of robot configurations (TOC), which is an algorithm that finds configurations from which the robot can better reach task-relevant locations and handle task variation. Notably, TOC can return one or two configurations to be used sequentially while assisting with a task. TOC performs computationally demanding optimizations offline to generate a function that rapidly outputs the configurations online based on the robot's observations. TOC explicitly models the task, environment, and user, and implicitly handles error using representations of robot dexterity. We evaluated TOC with a software simulation of a mobile manipulator (a PR2) providing assistance with 9 activities of daily living to a user in a wheelchair and a robotic bed. TOC had an overall average success rate of 90.6% compared to 50.4%, 43.5%, and 58.9% for three baseline algorithms based on state-of-the-art methods from the literature. We additionally demonstrate how TOC can find configurations for more than one robot and can help with the optimization of environments for assistance.", "Optogenetic probes can be powerful tools for dissecting complexity in cell biology, but there is a lack of instrumentation to exploit their potential for automated, high-information-content experiments, This protocol describes the construction and use of the optoPlate-96, a platform for high-throughput three-color optogenetics experiments that allows simultaneous manipulation of common red- and blue-light-sensitive optogenetic probes, The optoPlate-96 enables illumination of individual wells in 96-well microwell plates or in groups of wells in 384-well plates. Its design ensures that there will be no cross-illumination between microwells in 96-well plates, and an active cooling system minimizes sample heating during light-intensive experiments. This protocol details the steps to assemble, test, and use the optoPlate-96. The device can be fully assembled without specialized equipment beyond a 3D printer and a laser cutter, starting from open-source design files and commercially available components. We then describe how to perform a typical optogenetics experiment using the optoPlate-96 to stimulate adherent mammalian cells. Although optoPlate-96 experiments are compatible with any plate-based readout, we describe analysis using quantitative single-cell immunofluorescence. This workflow thus allows complex optogenetics experiments (independent control of stimulation colors, intensity, dynamics, and time points) with high-dimensional outputs at single-cell resolution. Starting from 3D-printed and laser-cut components, assembly and testing of the optoPlate-96 can be accomplished in 3-4 h, at a cost of similar to$600. A full optoPlate-96 experiment with immunofluorescence analysis can be performed within similar to 24 h, but this estimate is variable depending on the cell type and experimental parameters.", "As an emerging and promising computing paradigm in the Internet of things (IoT), edge computing can significantly reduce energy consumption and enhance computation capability for resource-constrained IoT devices. Computation offloading has recently received considerable attention in edge computing. Many existing studies have investigated the computation offloading problem with independent computing tasks. However, due to the inter-task dependency in various devices that commonly happens in IoT systems, achieving energy-efficient computation offloading decisions remains a challengeable problem. In this paper, a cloud-assisted edge computing framework with a three-tier network in an IoT environment is introduced. In this framework, we first formulated an energy consumption minimization problem as a mixed integer programming problem considering two constraints, the task-dependency requirement and the completion time deadline of the IoT service. To address this problem, we then proposed an Energy-efficient Collaborative Task Computation Offloading (ECTCO) algorithm based on a semidefinite relaxation and stochastic mapping approach to obtain strategies of tasks computation offloading for IoT sensors. Simulation results demonstrated that the cloud-assisted edge computing framework was feasible and the proposed ECTCO algorithm could effectively reduce the energy cost of IoT sensors.", "Additive manufacturing (AM), also known as 3D Printing, is believed to be a disruptive technology, and therefore the assessment of its ensuing sustainability impacts is necessary. The insufficient evidence in extant literature addressing the social impacts of AM suggests that the social sustainability aspect of this technology has received scant attention. The current study addresses this knowledge gap through a critical literature review that leads to the identification of 42 AM social impacts and their association with relevant stakeholders, shaping a social life cycle typology that indicates to what extent each stakeholder is affected by AM. Additionally, a set of illustrative indicators for measuring some of the identified AM social impacts are proposed. Finally, the findings are summarized in the form of a framework that can help future research to holistically investigate the social sustainability implications of AM technology.", "Sudden water pollution accidents happen frequently in China, and the number of treated accidents is low, due to the slow response speed. In addition, there is a lack of decision support systems that can follow up the whole process instead of just giving a one-time method. This study constructs a framework suitable for China that has both the ability of quick responses and full-time dynamic decision support, such as an experienced expert, while not being affected by pressure, to be used an emergency response for sudden water pollution accidents. To allow new decisionmakers to integrate into this professional decision-making role more quickly, a brain-inspired system is realized through combining the machine learning algorithm KNN and the idea of iteration and dynamic programming. The feasibility of our framework is further tested through a major water pollution happened recently. The results show that this framework can be well connected with the emergency response technology system that has been completed before, while also supporting the rapid and robust decision making such as the decisionmaker's second brain, reducing the demand for professional background and experience of emergency decisionmakers, thus effectively shorten the waiting period for response.", "Soil organic matter and organic carbon are variables of critical environmental importance in terms of soil productivity and function, global food security, and climate change mitigation. Rapid and accurate assessment of these variables is central to national programs and international agreements. Portable X-ray fluorescence instruments are widely used to rapidly quantify and map soil elements, however quantification of light elements that constitute the majority of organic materials is not yet possible with this technique (e.g. carbon). We developed a novel attachment for portable X-ray fluorescence instrumentation enabling concurrent volumetric soil organic matter and organic carbon quantification during PXRF analyses. This primary prototype outperformed more expensive visible-near infrared instrumentation using parsimonious soil specific simple linear regression (R-2 ranged 0.85-0.97) enabling rapid, parallel, nondestructive, cost-effective acquisition of soil elemental concentrations together with soil organic carbon and soil organic matter data.", "Design heuristics (DHS) as a tool can help boost designers' creativity in early conceptual design phases. We have developed a set of DHS for digital innovation (DHS10). There are numerous studies on DHS impacts/outcomes in the recent years. However, little research has been conducted to identify whether DHS has lasting benefits on designers' ideation performance. This paper explores whether DHS10 can help designers achieve more creative ideas based on different design briefs, and if DHS has lasting impacts on or benefits for students. An empirical study was conducted with two groups (i.e., 32 students who learned DHS10 five weeks ago, and 24 students who studied DHS10 instantly). They were asked to address an open-ended design brief on COVID-19 and generate as many innovative ideas as possible. The results suggest DHS has impacts on students who learned DHS just now and five weeks ago. The effect is stronger on those who just learned DHS10. We suggest that DHS10 be provided for ideation as it provides texts and visual stimuli for designers. DHS10 also has the potential to help students understand digital innovation and generate ideas accordingly.", "Electrically-assisted cycling can make a major contribution to sustainable mobility. For some people, hills are a barrier for cycling. This paper focuses on how and why electrically-assisted bikes make a difference to cycling in hilly contexts, and can thus be an important element of sustainable mobility in hilly geographies. It makes a novel contribution in being able to draw on recorded sensor data of the actual use of assistance in relation to the specific geography of the route cycled (GPS data), and interview/survey material. It shows that e-bikes extend the range, nature and scope of journeys manageable by bike, and therefore the general viability of e-bikes as alternative to other modes. It highlights that the benefits of using e-bikes are often also psychological, since they can change the overall enjoyability of the cycling experience in hilly areas. Resulting policy recommendations, that could lead to significant CO2 savings through the uptake of e-cycling in hilly contexts, include 'try before you buy' schemes, training for e-bike users and investing in relevant cycling infrastructure.", "Development and deployment of sensing technologies is one of the main steps in achieving sustainability in crop production through precision agriculture. Key sensing methodologies developed for monitoring soil moisture and nutrients with recent advances in the sensing devices reported in literature using those techniques are overviewed in this article. The soil moisture determination has been divided into four main sections describing soil moisture measurement metrics and laboratory-based testing, followed by in-situ, remote and proximal sensing techniques. The application, advantages and limitations for each of the mentioned technologies are discussed. The nutrient monitoring methods are reviewed beginning with laboratory-based methods, ion-selective membrane based sensors, bio-sensors, spectroscopy-based methods, and capillary electrophoresis-based systems for inorganic ion detection. Attention has been given to the core principle of detection while reporting recent sensors developed using the mentioned concepts. The latest works reported on the different sensing methodologies point towards the trend of developing low-cost, easy to use, field-deployable or portable sensing systems aimed towards improving technology adoption in crop production leading to efficient site-specific soil and crop management which in turn will bring us closer to reaching sustainability in the practice of agriculture.", "This article proposes an energy management system (EMS) for shared electric bicycles. The objective is to guarantee electric assistance to the cyclist while avoiding discharging the battery. The basic working principle exploits the cycling efficiency gaps. The proposed multilayered EMS is specifically tailored to a free-floating bike-sharing setting. The innermost layer manages the assistance and energy harvesting with the objective of yielding an intuitive human-machine interface. The middle level modulates the level of assistance so to track a desired average battery power. This is an adaptive model-based controller designed on a control-oriented model of the cyclist and bicycle energy dynamics. A cyclist profiling mechanism enables the model adaptation. The outermost loop guarantees the long-term robustness by tracking a desired battery state-of-charge profile. Extensive simulations and experimental tests validate this approach in terms of usability and charge sustenance, proving that the cyclist profiling is of paramount importance.", "The digital transformation of manufacturing (a phenomenon also known as Industry 4.0 or Smart Manufacturing) is finding a growing interest both at practitioner and academic levels, but is still in its infancy and needs deeper investigation. Even though current and potential advantages of digital manufacturing are remarkable, in terms of improved efficiency, sustainability, customization, and flexibility, only a limited number of companies has already developed ad hoc strategies necessary to achieve a superior performance. Through a systematic review, this study aims at assessing the current state of the art of the academic literature regarding the paradigm shift occurring in the manufacturing settings, in order to provide definitions as well as point out recurring patterns and gaps to be addressed by future research. For the literature search, the most representative keywords, strict criteria, and classification schemes based on authoritative reference studies were used. The final sample of 156 primary publications was analyzed through a systematic coding process to identify theoretical and methodological approaches, together with other significant elements. This analysis allowed a mapping of the literature based on clusters of critical themes to synthesize the developments of different research streams and provide the most representative picture of its current state. Research areas, insights, and gaps resulting from this analysis contributed to create a schematic research agenda, which clearly indicates the space for future evolutions of the state of knowledge in this field.", "In this study, we used the common and low-cost optical flow sensor as the core of image processing. We simply adopted a set of designed discs with pattern sticker on it as a disc-shaped reader to transfer the angle variation (rotation) to a linear motion. Angle variation is obtained using lower cost sensors. Therefore, significantly reduction of the manufacturing cost of the grating, which is inside the optical angle encoder could be made. Angle sensors can be used more widely and universally in a wide variety of designs in the foreseeable future.", "The ways and the means are suggested of performing synchronized distributed computing for quick interaction support in a group of automatic mobile objects. The computations are controlled decentralized and are performed on the transmitted messages content during the transmission process without delay for performing the computation. The transmitters synchronize the messages transmission so that the same bit positions of messages group are processed simultaneously. It is shown that the solutions suggested accelerate the reaction of a system operating in a hard real-time conditions on changes in the system state and in the external environment.", "Eye movement is one of the biological signals whose exploration may reveal substantial information, enabling greater understanding of the biology of the brain and its mechanisms. In this research, eye movement dynamics were studied in terms of chaotic behavior and self-similarity assessment to provide a description of young, healthy, oculomotor system characteristics. The first of the investigated features is present and advantageous for many biological objects or physiological phenomena, and its vanishing or diminishment may indicate a system pathology. Similarly, exposed self-similarity may prove useful for indicating a young and healthy system characterized by adaptability. For this research, 24 young people with normal vision were involved. Their eye movements were registered with the usage of a head-mounted eye tracker, using infrared oculography, embedded in the sensor, measuring the rotations of the left and the right eye. The influence of the preprocessing step in the form of the application of various filtering methods on the assessment of the final dynamics was also explored. The obtained results confirmed the existence of chaotic behavior in some parts of eye movement signal; however, its strength turned out to be dependent on the filter used. They also exposed the long-range correlation representing self-similarity, although the influence of the applied filters on these outcomes was not unveiled.", "This paper proposes a technique to control distributed energy resources in low-voltage microgrids aiming at (i) allowing power flow control at the point of connection with the upstream grid, (ii) keeping voltage profiles within the operational limits. The first feature is crucial in smart low-voltage power systems. In fact, it enables both demand-responses, which is extremely valuable from the point of view of distribution system operators and for energy trading, and the autonomous operation of the microgrid. The latter can be achieved by regulating to zero the power exchanged with the main grid. The second feature allows to limit voltage increases due to active power injection by distributed energy resources and, thus, to limit stresses on the electrical infrastructure and the served loads, which is a concrete issue as renewables become widely deployed in the low-voltage scenario. The proposed approach is firstly described in detail, then a systematic analysis of its local and global properties is reported. All the obtained results are verified considering the IEEE 37 test feeder in realistic operating conditions.", "Clinical requirements have necessitated the development of biomedical nanomaterials that can be implanted into tissues or bodies. Physiological regulation can be achieved in these nanomaterials through external light. The combination of nanomaterials with infrared optics can be termed optogenetics. The low autofluorescence of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) has several applications in the biological field. For optogenetics applications, UCNPs with high fluorescence performance and photostability can solve the penetration depth problem. NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystals with controllable sizes, shapes, and compositions were synthesized using a rapid coprecipitation method in organic solvent. UCNPs using single crystal nanoparticles provide higher chemical stability than those using amorphous phase. However, because UCNPs are usually capped with hydrophobic ligands, it is particularly important to prepare biocompatible UCNPs with specific molecular recognition capabilities. Surface modification and subsequent functionalization are essential for the application of inorganic nanomaterials in the biological environment and are arousing increasing research interest. Due to the high biocompatibility and high loading of materials, mesoporous silica and amine groups were selected as the best candidates. Expression of plasmid DNA in vivo and transfection efficiency were determined by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. The MTT assay was used to evaluate the particle biocompatibility; the results showed that UCNP@mSiO(2) has great biocompatibility. Additionally, at neutral pH, the cell surface is negatively charged. Therefore, the surface is functionalized with amino groups and can be electrostatically bound to DNA. Finally, UCNP@mSiO(2)-NH2 as a vector was applied in live cells by loading DNA; according to the results, DNA-UCNPs were successfully transfected in the primary cells, and NaYF4:Yb,Tm@mSiO(2)-NH2-DNA were observed to have good transfection efficiency by flow cytometry. It is expected that this work will provide a different method from the traditional adenovirus method and improve the immune response and side effects caused by adenovirus.", "This work presents a review and discussion of the challenges that must be solved in order to successfully develop swarms of Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) for real world operations. From the discussion, we extract constraints and links that relate the local level MAV capabilities to the global operations of the swarm. These should be taken into account when designing swarm behaviors in order to maximize the utility of the group. At the lowest level, each MAV should operate safely. Robustness is often hailed as a pillar of swarm robotics, and a minimum level of local reliability is needed for it to propagate to the global level. An MAV must be capable of autonomous navigation within an environment with sufficient trustworthiness before the system can be scaled up. Once the operations of the single MAV are sufficiently secured for a task, the subsequent challenge is to allow the MAVs to sense one another within a neighborhood of interest. Relative localization of neighbors is a fundamental part of self-organizing robotic systems, enabling behaviors ranging from basic relative collision avoidance to higher level coordination. This ability, at times taken for granted, also must be sufficiently reliable. Moreover, herein lies a constraint: the design choice of the relative localization sensor has a direct link to the behaviors that the swarm can (and should) perform. Vision-based systems, for instance, force MAVs to fly within the field of view of their camera. Range or communication-based solutions, alternatively, provide omni-directional relative localization, yet can be victim to unobservable conditions under certain flight behaviors, such as parallel flight, and require constant relative excitation. At the swarm level, the final outcome is thus intrinsically influenced by the on-board abilities and sensors of the individual. The real-world behavior and operations of an MAV swarm intrinsically follow in a bottom-up fashion as a result of the local level limitations in cognition, relative knowledge, communication, power, and safety. Taking these local limitations into account when designing a global swarm behavior is key in order to take full advantage of the system, enabling local limitations to become true strengths of the swarm.", "Considering the increase in life expectancy, people started to invest in technologies capable of improving the quality of life. One of these technologies is the Brain-Machine Interface. Combined with EEG signals, this technique may allow individuals with some motor disabilities to perform activities of daily living. Motor Imagery came up as an important tool to support this population. So they may send commands to external devices by using their brain voluntary activity. In this chapter, the performance of an Imagery EEG-based BCI engine was accessed by applyingWavelet transform to the signals and extracting metrics used to describe digital signals. We used signals from the motor imagery of the right hand, left hand and foot movements. Different intelligent classifiers were tested. We achieved results greater than 99% of accuracy and Kappa above 0.99. The method is promising and can be used for future evaluations with several individuals to verify reproducibility.", "The transcriptional inducer anhydrotetracycline (aTc) and the bacteriostatic antibiotic tetracycline (Tc) are commonly used in all fields of biology for control of transcription or translation. A drawback of these and other small molecule inducers is the difficulty of their removal from cell cultures, limiting their application for dynamic control. Here, we describe a simple method to overcome this limitation, and show that the natural photosensitivity of aTc/Tc can be exploited to turn them into highly predictable optogenetic transcriptional- and growth-regulators. This new optogenetic class uniquely features both dynamic and setpoint control which act via population-memory adjustable through opto-chemical modulation. We demonstrate this method by applying it for dynamic gene expression control and for enhancing the performance of an existing optogenetic system. We then expand the utility of the aTc system by constructing a new chemical bandpass filter that increases its aTc response range. The simplicity of our method enables scientists and biotechnologists to use their existing systems employing aTc/Tc for dynamic optogenetic experiments without genetic modification. Anhydrotetracycline and tetracycline are commonly used chemicals to regulate transcription and translation, respectively. Here the authors exploit the natural photosensitivity of these molecules to place their activity under optical control.", "The main aim of this paper is to explore how these 3D printing enthusiasts make sense of their 3D printing activities online and offline, and how these activities can be explained in terms of the theoretical concepts user innovation and user entrepreneurship. This paper builds on an in-depth interview study and reveals four ideal types (Halkier, 2011) of 3D printing enthusiasts: entrepreneurial, hobby, individual, and sharing. Based on the theoretical concepts of user innovation and user entrepreneurship, the four ideal types of 3D printing enthusiasts show varying degrees of willingness to engage in 3D communities and disseminate their ideas and innovations beyond in-house or in-community use. We contribute to user innovation and user entrepreneurship research by highlighting 3D printing enthusiasts as a specific group of user innovators/entrepreneurs with characteristics especially favourable to the diffusion of their ideas, designs, and innovations peer-to-peer or commercially.", "Beer quality is a difficult concept to describe and assess by physicochemical and sensory analysis due to the complexity of beer appreciation and acceptability by consumers, which can be dynamic and related to changes in climate affecting raw materials, consumer preference, and rising quality requirements. Artificial intelligence (AI) may offer unique capabilities based on the integration of sensor technology, robotics, and data analysis using machine learning (ML) to identify specific quality traits and process modifications to produce quality beers. This research presented the integration and implementation of AI technology based on low-cost sensor networks in the form of an electronic nose (e-nose), robotics, and ML. Results of ML showed high accuracy (97%) in the identification of fermentation type (Model 1) based on e-nose data; prediction of consumer acceptability from near-infrared (Model 2; R = 0.90) and e-nose data (Model 3; R = 0.95), and physicochemical and colorimetry of beers from e-nose data. The use of the RoboBEER coupled with the e-nose and AI could be used by brewers to assess the fermentation process, quality of beers, detection of faults, traceability, and authentication purposes in an affordable, user-friendly, and accurate manner.", "Disabilities of the upper limb, such as hemiplegia or upper limb amputation, can limit automobile drivers to steering with one healthy arm. For the benefit of these drivers, recent studies have developed prototype interfaces that realized surface electromyography (sEMG)-controlled steering assistance with path-following accuracy that has been validated with driving simulations. In contrast, the current study expands the application of sEMG-controlled steering assistance by validating the Myo armband, a mass-produced sEMG-based interface, with respect to the path-following accuracy of a commercially available automobile. It was hypothesized that one-handed remote steering with the Myo armband would be comparable or superior to the conventional operation of the automobile steering wheel. Although results of low-speed field testing indicate that the Myo armband had lower path-following accuracy than the steering wheel during a 90 degrees turn and wide U-turn at twice the minimum turning radius, the Myo armband had superior path-following accuracy for a narrow U-turn at the minimum turning radius and a 45 degrees turn. Given its overall comparability to the steering wheel, the Myo armband could be feasibly applied in future automobile studies.", "Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) superfamily and have crucial roles during development; induding mesodermal patterning and specification of renal, hepatic, and skeletal tissues. In vitro developmental models currently rely upon costly and unreliable recombinant BMP proteins that do not enable dynamic or precise activation of the BMP signaling pathway. Here, we report the development of an optogenetic BMP signaling system (optoBMP) that enables rapid induction of the canonical BMP signaling pathway driven by illumination with blue light. We demonstrate the utility of the optoBMP system in multiple human cell lines to initiate signal transduction through phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of SMAD1/5, leading to upregulation of BMP target genes including Inhibitors of DNA binding 1D2 and 1D4. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the optoBMP system can be used to fine-tune activation of the BMP signaling pathway through variable light stimulation. Optogenetic control of BMP signaling will enable dynamic and high-throughput intervention across a variety of applications in cellular and developmental systems.", "Optogenetic tools can provide direct and programmable control of gene expression. Light-inducible recombinases, in particular, offer a powerful method for achieving precise spatiotemporal control of DNA modification. However, to-date this technology has been largely limited to eukaryotic systems. Here, we develop optogenetic recombinases for Escherichia coli that activate in response to blue light. Our approach uses a split recombinase coupled with photodimers, where blue light brings the split protein together to form a functional recombinase. We tested both Cre and Flp recombinases, Vivid and Magnet photodimers, and alternative protein split sites in our analysis. The optimal configuration, Opto-Cre-Vvd, exhibits strong blue light-responsive excision and low ambient light sensitivity. For this system we characterize the effect of light intensity and the temporal dynamics of light-induced recombination. These tools expand the microbial optogenetic toolbox, offering the potential for precise control of DNA excision with light-inducible recombinases in bacteria.", "Today, in the medical field, innovative technological advancements support healthcare systems and improve patients' lives. 4D printing is one of the innovative technologies that creates notable innovations in the medical field. For the COVID-19 pandemic, this technology proves to be useful in the manufacturing of smart medical parts, which helps treat infected patients. As compared to 3D printing, 4D printing adds time as an additional element in the manufactured part. 4D printing uses smart materials with the same printing processes as being used in 3D printing technology, but here the part printed with smart materials change their shape with time or by the change of environmental temperature, which further creates innovation for patient treatments. 4D printing manufactures a given part, layer by layer, by taking input of a virtual (CAD) model and uses smart material. This paper studies the capability of smart materials and their advancements when used in 4D printing. We have diagrammatically presented the significant parts of 4D printing technology. This paper identifies 11 significant applications of 4D printing and then studies which one provides innovative solutions during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "Monitoring behavior of grazing animals offers great potential to improve livestock management. However, few technologies are capable of collecting data and a limited number of methods may be used to classify these data and determine behavior. We propose an inertial measurement unit (INR) for classifying the behavior and heart rate (HR) monitoring to estimate energy expenditure (EE) of one (a=1) goat grazing in the Argentinean Monte Desert. Behavior was classified as resting in the pen (RP), resting in the field (RI), walking (W) and grazing (G). The behavior classification was performed using the Random Forests algorithm. Walking was detected with the highest precision (96%), while the precision was lowest for Grazing (80%). Goat activities could be predicted with an average precision above 86% and a recall of 85%, which suggests viability for real-life applications. Total EE of grazing was 535.1 KJ ME kg BW(0.75)d(-1), while EE of W, G, RF and RP were 53.8,108.5, 99.0 and 273.9 K3 kg BW0.75 d(-1), respectively. The goat walked 7,187 km, at an average speed of 4.22 km h(-1), with an energy cost of displacement at 7.48 J kg BW0.75 m(-1). These results expose the viability, relevance and usefulness of applying this methodology to study different factors affecting the behavior and energy expenditure of goats grazing in arid areas.", "As it was mentioned in the previous part of this work (Part I)-the advanced signal processing methods are one of the quickest and the most dynamically developing scientific areas of biomedical engineering with their increasing usage in current clinical practice. In this paper, which is a Part II work-various innovative methods for the analysis of brain bioelectrical signals were presented and compared. It also describes both classical and advanced approaches for noise contamination removal such as among the others digital adaptive and non-adaptive filtering, signal decomposition methods based on blind source separation, and wavelet transform.", "Despite the unpredicted weather conditions challenge ways of traditional farming, farmers still prefer traditional methods. This may be due to the challenge to interact with the existing technology to suit dynamic farming requirements. Therefore, this study evaluates the performance of a proposed feasible and user-friendly system in monitoring and controlling the variables that influence the growth of vegetables leading to optimal growth for indoor farming. The proposed system used various sensors to monitor temperature, humidity, and soil moisture; and to optimally control these parameters. Besides, a graphical user interface (GUI) was designed as a human machine interface so that users can set desired value for each parameter to suit a plant. The results show that the proposed system was able to accurately provide sufficient light that vegetables needed using a LED spectral lighting, and to control the temperature that was better than a typical outdoor traditional cultivation (i.e. with averaged total hourly cumulative errors per day of 11 and 16 degrees C, respectively). Thus, this proposed system can minimize the effects from unpredictable weather to a farming by automatically monitoring and controlling parameters of temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light with respective desired values that set by users via the GUI.", "Anaerobic co-digestion in wastewater treatment plants is looking increasingly like a straightforward solution to many issues arising from the operation of mono-digestion. Process modelling is relevant to predict plant behavior and its sensitivity to operational parameters, and to assess the feasibility of simultaneously feeding a digester with different organic wastes. Still, much work has to be completed to turn anaerobic digestion modelling into a reliable and practical tool. Indeed, the complex biochemical processes described in the ADM1 model require the identification of several parameters and many analytical determinations for substrate characterization.

Motivated by the research on how animals exploit their visual topographies to rapidly perform locomotion, we propose a bio-inspired method that applies quasi-parallax technique to estimate the velocity of an MAV equipped with a forward-looking stereo camera without GPS. Different to the available optical flow-based methods, our method can realize efficient metric velocity estimation without applying any depth information from either additional distance sensors or from stereopsis. In particular, the quasi-parallax technique, which claims to press maximal benefits from the configuration of two frontally parallel cameras, leverages pairs of parallel visual rays to eliminate rotational flow for translational velocity estimation, followed by refinement of the estimation of rotational velocity and translational velocity iteratively and alternately. Our method fuses the motion information from two frontal-parallel cameras without performing correspondences matching, achieving enhanced robustness and efficiency. Extensive experiments on synthesized and actual scenes demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.", "Anaerobic co-digestion in wastewater treatment plants is looking increasingly like a straightforward solution to many issues arising from the operation of mono-digestion. Process modelling is relevant to predict plant behavior and its sensitivity to operational parameters, and to assess the feasibility of simultaneously feeding a digester with different organic wastes. Still, much work has to be completed to turn anaerobic digestion modelling into a reliable and practical tool. Indeed, the complex biochemical processes described in the ADM1 model require the identification of several parameters and many analytical determinations for substrate characterization. A combined protocol including batch Biochemical Methane Potential tests and analytical determinations is proposed and applied for substrate influent characterization to simulate a pilot-scale anaerobic digester where co-digestion of waste sludge and expired yogurt was operated.

Double-sided (bifacial) panels are gaining increasing popularity in commercial applications due to the increased energy yield with a constant occupied mounting surface. However, the value of the additional energy yield produced by the back of the panel depends on several important factors. This paper presents the influence of working conditions on electricity generation in bifacial modules. This paper also investigates the influence of weather conditions, the module inclination angle, and the substrate beneath the panel surface on electricity generation. Fill factor and efficiency were calculated for each case included in the study scope. Based on the current voltage, power characteristics, and calculations, the module operation for different conditions was compared. It was observed that the optimal inclination angle to the surface is higher for the bifacial modules compared to the unilateral modules. The type of surface under the module has also been indicated to impact the amount of electricity generated. The additional energy yield associated with the panels' rear side accounts for 2% to more than 35% of the total power generated by a photovoltaic (PV) module. The unit cost of electricity generation in the analyzed cases was also determined.", "In this paper, solar photovoltaic (SPV)-based microgrid has been connected to grid. Modified synchronous reference frame control of PV inverter has been proposed to estimate reference current for power quality improvement. Conventionally, DC link voltage of the PV inverter is regulated using proportional integral (PI) controller, which suffers from undershoot/overshoot and long settling time during load variation. Intelligent control technique can be the better solution with more accuracy and fast dynamic response. In the present work, interval type-2 (IT-2)-based fuzzy logic controller (FLC) has been proposed to control inverter's DC link voltage. Performance of the grid-connected SPV system is analyzed using proposed IT-2 FLC and compared with conventional PI as well as type-1 FLC. It compensates the harmonics of the nonlinear load and maintains the grid at unity power factor by supplying the reactive demand of the load. Total harmonic distortion at grid side of the system is within the limits as per IEEE-519 standard. To test the efficacy of the proposed IT-2 FLC for grid-connected SPV system MATLAB software2016(a) has been used.", "How do new ventures gain legitimacy and attract critical resources? An increasing body of cultural entrepreneurship research has highlighted an \"optimal distinctiveness\" trade-off: new ventures need to be distinctive from their peers to stand out, yet distinctiveness counteracts the attainment of organizational legitimacy. In this paper, we challenge the underlying assumption that distinctiveness necessarily counteracts the attainment of legitimacy and propose that distinctiveness can become a source of legitimacy. This proposition matters because it fundamentally alters the relationship between distinctiveness and resource acquisition from certain audiences. We build on these theoretical arguments to examine new ventures' resource acquisition from crowdfunders, one of the most important audiences for new ventures. Analysis of 28,425 crowdfunding campaigns across 39 market categories strongly supports our arguments, showing that higher levels of distinctiveness lead to superior crowdfunding performance. We further demonstrate that the legitimating effect of distinctiveness intensifies under the absence of alternative sources of legitimacy. Our study contributes by uncovering a new mechanism and three contingencies for the \"optimal distinctiveness\" trade-off.", "This article presents a robust brightness gradient-based estimation strategy for small aerial robots. The proposed nonlinear observer is capable of estimating the flight altitude and ego-motion by the fusion of monocular vision and inertial measurement unit feedback. The novelty primarily lies in the implementation of the gradient-based featureless approach and the direct use of photometric feedback in the state and output vectors. Under the single-plane assumption, the proposed framework permits the entire estimation process to be accomplished efficiently in a single iterative step without the need for feature detection and tracking or precomputation of optic flow as commonly seen in conventional methods. The nonlinear and featureless implementation reduces the computational demand, enlarges the region of attraction, and markedly improves the robustness of the ego-motion estimation against scenes with scarce features when compared to Kalman-based estimators and feature-based methods. We conducted extensive flight experiments with different flying patterns and textures to evaluate the performance of the proposed observer. The results reveal that the root-mean-square error in the altitude estimates is approximately 10% for flights at approximate to 40-130 cm above the ground, comparable to feature-based estimators. Nevertheless, the devised observer does better than feature-based methods when deployed on low-textured scenes or with low-resolution blurry images.", "Internet technology has broken the boundaries of traditional geographical space, greatly shortened the spacetime distance between regions, and maximized the integration of various resources. Therefore, in the era of the digital economy, the rapid development of network information technology, the energy internet and other new forms of the network economy may affect energy consumption. This paper mainly studies how internet development affects China's energy consumption and the associated transmission mechanism. Specifically, this paper constructs an evaluation system of China's internet development level from four perspectives: internet popularity, internet infrastructure, internet information resources and internet application. On this basis, the relationship between internet development and China's energy consumption is investigated and found to be significantly positive; moreover, internet development promotes the energy consumption scale through economic growth. The relationship between internet development and the energy consumption structure is significantly negative, and internet development affects the energy consumption structure through economic growth, R&D investment, human capital, financial development, and the industrial structure. Interestingly, there is also empirical evidence that the nexus of internet development and energy consumption intensity is significantly negative, and internet development helps to accelerate the decline in energy consumption intensity through economic growth, R&D investment, human capital, financial development, and industrial structural upgrading.

But in comparison to conventional manufacturing techniques, AM has the advantage of being able to easily individualize each manufactured structure. Hence, mounting structures can be designed and adapted such, that the measured inner decentrations of conventionally manufactured optical elements to be mounted can be compensated. With this, the error budget contributions from optical elements can be minimized, either to relax their or their mounting structure tolerances or to reduce the overall system tolerance. To prove this concept, we designed an optical system to quantify small displacements of optical elements within a simple to replace additive manufactured mounting structure. From analysing the recorded intensity distribution, one can accurately quantify the lateral decentration of one of the optical elements in respect to the other one. The first experimental results show, that it is feasible to control and adjust the decentration of an optical element mounted in an additively manufactured structure.", "Capillary forces are commonly employed to transport fluids in pump-free microfluidic platforms such as paper-based microfluidics. However, since paper is a porous material consisting of nonuniform cellulose fibers, it has some limitations in performing stable flow functions like mixing. Here, we developed a pump-free microfluidic device that enables rapid mixing by combining paper and plastic. The device was fabricated by laminating transparency film and double-sided adhesive and is composed of an overlapping inlet ending in a paper-based reaction area. The mixing performance of the developed device was confirmed experimentally using aqueous dyes and pH indicators. In addition, the absolute mixing index was evaluated by numerically calculating the concentration field across the microfluidic channels. To demonstrate the utility of the new approach, the detection of an organophosphate pesticide was carried out using a colorimetric enzymatic inhibition assay. The developed device and a smartphone application were used to detect organophosphate pesticide on food samples, demonstrating the potential for onsite analysis.", "Common methods to assess hearing deficits and the benefit of hearing devices include retrospective questionnaires and speech tests under controlled conditions. As typically applied, both approaches suffer from serious limitations regarding their ecological validity. An alternative approach rapidly gaining widespread use is ecological momentary assessment (EMA), which employs repeated assessments of individual everyday situations. Smartphones facilitate the implementation of questionnaires and rating schemes to be administered in the real life of study participants or customers, during or shortly after an experience. In addition, objective acoustical parameters extracted from head- or body-worn microphones and/or settings from the hearing aid's signal processing unit can be stored alongside the questionnaire data. The advantages of using EMA include participant-specific, context-sensitive information on activities, experienced challenges, and preferences. However, to preserve the privacy of all communication partners and bystanders, the law in many countries does not allow audio recordings, limiting the information about environmental acoustics to statistical data such as, for example, levels and averaged spectra. Other challenges for EMA are, for example, the unsupervised handling of the equipment, the trade-off between the accuracy of description and the number of similar listening situations when performing comparisons (e.g., with and without hearing aids), the trade-off between the duration of recording intervals and the amount of data collected and analyzed, the random or target-oriented reminder for subjective responses, as well as the willingness and ability of the participants to respond while doing specific tasks. This contribution reviews EMA in hearing research, its purpose, current applications, and possible future directions.", "Ego-motion estimation is a core task in robotic systems as well as in augmented and virtual reality applications. It is often solved using visual-inertial odometry, which involves using one or more <italic>always-on</italic> cameras on mobile robots and wearable devices. As consumers increasingly use such devices in their homes and workplaces, which are filled with sensitive details, the role of privacy in such camera-based approaches is of ever increasing importance. In this letter, we introduce the first solution to perform <italic>privacy-preserving</italic> ego-motion estimation. We recover camera ego-motion from an extremely low-resolution monocular camera by estimating dense optical flow at a higher spatial resolution (i.e., 4x super resolution). We propose <italic>SRFNet</italic> for directly estimating Super-Resolved Flow, a novel convolutional neural network model that is trained in a supervised setting using ground-truth optical flow. We also present a weakly supervised approach for training a variant of SRFNet on real videos where ground truth flow is unavailable. On image pairs with known relative camera orientations, we use SRFNet to predict the auto-epipolar flow that arises from pure camera translation, from which we robustly estimate the camera translation direction. We evaluate our super-resolved optical flow estimates and camera translation direction estimates on the Sintel and KITTI odometry datasets, where our methods outperform several baselines. Our results indicate that robust ego-motion recovery from extremely low-resolution images can be viable when camera orientations and metric scale is recovered from inertial sensors and fused with the estimated translations.", "Grip force control during robotic in-hand manipulation is usually modeled as a monolithic task, where complex controllers consider the placement of all fingers and the contact states between each finger and the gripped object in order to compute the necessary forces to be applied by each finger. Such approaches normally rely on object and contact models and do not generalize well to novel manipulation tasks. Here, we propose a modular grip stabilization method based on a proposition that explains how humans achieve grasp stability. In this biomimetic approach, independent tactile grip stabilization controllers ensure that slip does not occur locally at the engaged robot fingers. Local slip is predicted from the tactile signals of each fingertip sensor i.e., BioTac and BioTac SP by Syntouch. We show that stable grasps emerge without any form of central communication when such independent controllers are engaged in the control of multi-digit robotic hands. The resulting grasps are resistant to external perturbations while ensuring stable grips on a wide variety of objects.", "The understanding of the nature and structure of energy use in large buildings is vital for defining novel energy and climate change strategies. The advances on metering technology and low-cost devices make it possible to form a submetering network, which measures the main supply and other intermediate points providing information of the behavior of different areas. However, an analysis by means of classical techniques can lead to wrong conclusions if the load is not balanced. This paper proposes the use of a deep convolutional autoencoder to reconstruct the whole consumption measured by the submeters using the learnt features in order to analyze the behavior of different building areas. The display of weights and information of the latent space provided by the autoencoder allows us to obtain precise details of the influence of each area in the whole building consumption and its dependence on external factors such as temperature. A submetering network is deployed in the Leon University Hospital building in order to test the proposed methodology. The results show different correlations between environmental variables and building areas and indicate that areas can be grouped depending on their function in the building performance. Furthermore, this approach is able to provide discernible results in the presence of large differences with respect to the consumption ranges of the different areas, unlike conventional approaches where the influence of smaller areas is usually hidden.", ["Background: Over the last century, disruptive incidents in the fields of clinical and biomedical research have yielded a tremendous change in health data management systems.

The goal is to search the targets in the minimum time while avoiding collisions with other robots. In this paper, inspired by pedestrian behavior, swarm robotic pedestrian behavior (SRPB) was proposed. It considered many realistic constraints in the multi-target search problem, including limited communication range, limited working time, unknown sources, unknown extrema, the arbitrary initial location of robots, non-oriented search, and no central coordination. The performance of different cooperative strategies was evaluated in terms of average time to find the first, the half, and the last source, the number of located sources and the collision rate. Several experiments with different target signals, fixed initial location, arbitrary initial location, different population sizes, and the different number of targets were implemented. It was demonstrated by numerous experiments that SRPB had excellent stability, quick source seeking, a high number of located sources, and a low collision rate in various search strategies.", "The large amount of sensors in modern electrical networks poses a serious challenge in the data processing side. For many years, spectral analysis has been one of the most used approaches to extract physically meaningful information from a sea of data. Fourier Transform (FT) and Wavelet Transform (WT) are by far the most employed tools in this analysis. In this paper we explore the alternative use of Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) for electricity demand spectral representation. A sequence of hourly consumptions, spanning 40 months of electrical demand in Spain, has been used as dataset. First, by Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), the sequence has been time-represented as an ensemble of 13 Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). Later on, by applying Hilbert Transform (HT) to every IMF, an HHT spectrum has been obtained. Results show smoother spectra with more defined shapes and an excellent frequency resolution. EMD also fosters a deeper analysis of abnormal electricity demand at different timescales. Additionally, EMD permits information compression, which becomes very significant for lossless sequence representation. A 35% reduction has been obtained for the electricity demand sequence. On the negative side, HHT demands more computer resources than conventional spectral analysis techniques."], "doi": ["10.1002/stc.73", "10.1145/1042091.1042120", "10.1109/ICACT.2005.245963",
