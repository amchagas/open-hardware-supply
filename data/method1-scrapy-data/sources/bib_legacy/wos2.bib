Abstract = {{Purpose A toy UAV performs tumbling, rolling, racing and other complex
   activities. It is based on low-cost hardware and hence requires a better
   algorithm to estimate the attitudes more accurately with low power
   consumption. The proposed technique based on optimized Madgwick filter
   and moving average filter (MAF) ensures improved convergence speed in
   estimating the attitude, achieves higher accuracy and provides
   robustness and stability of the toy UAV. The paper aims to discuss this
   issue.
   Design/methodology/approach Traditional methods are prone to problems
   such as slow convergence speed and errors in calculation of the attitude
   angles. These errors cause the vehicle to drift and tremble, thus
   affecting the overall stability of the vehicle. The proposed method
   combines the features of optimized Madgwick filter and MAF to provide
   better accuracy, achieved through the fusion of gyroscope and
   accelerometer data, and zero correction to eliminate the random drift
   error of the gyroscope and removal of high-frequency interference by MAF
   of the accelerometer data. The experimental results on actual flight
   data showed that the method was better than the conventional Madgwick
   and Mahony complementary filters.
   Findings The performance of the proposed method was analyzed by
   estimating the pitch and roll angles under the static and dynamic
   condition of the toy UAV. The results were compared with two traditional
   methods: Madgwick and Mahony complement filter. In the static condition,
   the variance and average error while estimating the attitudes was
   comparatively lower than the traditional method. For the dynamic
   conditions, the convergence time to achieve a prescribed swing angle was
   again lower than the traditional method. From these two experiments, it
   can be seen that the proposed method provides better attitude estimation
   at lower computation time.
   Originality/value The proposed method combines the optimized Madgwick
   filter and MAF to accuracy estimate the attitude of toy UAV. The
   algorithm mainly suits the toy UAVs which are based on low-cost hardware
   and require better control systems to ensure stability of the vehicle.
   The experimental results on real flight data illustrate that the method
   not only improves the convergence speed in estimating the attitude angle
   for large maneuvers of the toy UAV, but also achieves higher accuracy in
   the attitude estimation, thus ensuring the robustness and stability of
   the UAV.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most critical parameters in agricultural production is
   environmental conditions. It is of vital importance to ensure and
   monitor suitable climatic conditions for various controlled agricultural
   structures and production systems such as greenhouses. To this aim, most
   data monitoring systems cannot be efficiently used due to high cost and
   insufficient technical knowledge. It is possible to design low-cost and
   scalable monitoring, control and data acquisition systems via open
   source hardware in order to monitor climatic data for agricultural
   practices in small enterprises and rural areas. In this study, a low
   cost system designed via open source hardware was tested under real
   conditions. Temperature and relative humidity were measured via the
   sensors in the system and sent to a data server through a wireless
   network. In addition, collected data was compared to reference devices
   for statistical analysis. The results suggest that these low-cost
   systems, which are designed via open source hardware, can be used as a
   data collection and decision support, system by agricultural

Abstract = {{The need for fabricating a prototype circuit arises frequently in
   electronics, including education and research laboratories. In
   resource-poor countries in the developing world, this is hindered by the
   high cost of commercial Printed Circuit Board (PCB) prototyping machines
   and long turn-around commercial fabrication process. Practical, hands-on
   laboratory teaching and experimentation is necessary to improve learning
   in electronics. In this paper, a low-cost build-your-own (BYO)
   semi-automated three-axis PCB milling machine for double-sided PCB
   prototyping is developed using commercial components and open source
   hardware and free open source software, to provide students, teachers,
   and engineers an accessible and affordable resource for PCB prototyping.
   Also, the main problems encountered during fabrication of PCB have been
   mentioned and the techniques used to solve them are discussed in detail.

Abstract = {{Water removal is an essential step during crude oil production due to
   several problems such as increased transportation costs and high
   corrosion rate due to dissolved salts. Indirect low frequency ultrasonic
   energy (US), using baths, has been recently proposed as an effective
   alternative for crude oil demulsification. However, the reactor position
   during sonication and its influence on the demulsification efficiency
   for crude oil has not been evaluated. In this sense, the aim of this
   study was to develop an automated system based on an open source
   hardware for mapping the acoustic field distribution in an US bath
   operating at 35 kHz using a hydrophone. Data acquired with this system
   provided information to evaluate the demulsification efficiency in the
   different positions of the US bath and correlate it with the acoustic
   intensity distribution. The automated 3D-mapping system revealed a
   higher acoustic intensity in the regions immediately above the
   transducers (ca. 0.6 W cm(-2)), while the other regions presented a
   relatively lower intensity (ca. 0.1 W cm(-2)). Experimental data
   demonstrated that reactors positioned in the most intense acoustic
   regions provided a much higher efficiency of demulsificadon in
   comparison with the ones positioned in the less intense acoustic field
   regions. Demulsification efficiency up to 93\% was obtained with 15 min
   of sonication (100\% amplitude) using few amount of chemical
   demulsifier. Hence, this work demonstrated that the information acquired
   with the developed mapping system could be used for inducing a higher
   efficiency of demulsification only by finding the more suitable position
   of reactor in the US bath, which certainly will help development of
   appropriate reactors design when looking for such approach.}},

   the Standard Multiplication (grade school multiplication) with a
   complexity order of O(n(2)) by a Karatsuba multiplication with a
   complexity of O(n(1:585)), so that all the critical hardware components
   are shared. Moreover, the proposed design was developed to deal with
   modulus length of 1024 up to 4096-bit. The architecture was described in
   Tensilica (R) Instruction Extension (TIE) language and synthesized in
   Cadence (R) Xtensa Xplorer. Experiments show that our design can perform

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new algorithm for on-line learning of Random Vector
   Functional-Link neural network is proposed. It is specifically tailored
   to hardware implementations with finite precision arithmetic in
   distributed computing scenarios, where the massive use of low-cost
   hardware resources for sensor networks or computing agents is necessary
   in order to deal with big data, IoT paradigms and multiple sources of
   information. The proposed algorithm does not require any specific DSP
   operation to be implemented in hardware, like matrix inversions or
   multiplications, for real-time learning. However, experimental results
   prove that the algorithm outperforms commonly adopted recursive
   least-squares algorithms optimized for hardware implementation, while
   the loss of performance with respect to batch training is reduced, as
   the proposed approach is proved to be very efficient when a reduced
   number of bits is adopted for finite precision hardware implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Vertical jump tests are used to assess lower-limb power of
   athletes in sport sciences. Flight time measurement with jump-mat
   systems is the most common procedure for this purpose. The aim of this
   study was to analyze the concurrent validity and reliability of two
   proprietary systems (Globus and Axon) and an open-source system
   (Chronojump). Methods: A conditioning electric circuit governed by a
   controlled wave generator is designed to substitute athletes jumping on
   a physical mat. In order to look for possible differences associated to
   timekeeping by each microcontroller device, all three systems are fed by
   the circuit simultaneously. Results: Concurrent validity was high for
   the three systems. Standarized typical error of estimate (TEE) was
   trivial, according to MBI interpretation as well as perfect Pearson
   correlation coefficient. Reliability was assessed based on the
   coefficient of variation of flight time measure, resulting in
   0.17-0.63\% (0.05-0.12 cm) for Globus, 0.01\% (0.09 cm) for Chronojump
   and 5.65-9.38\% (2.15-3.53 cm) for Axon. These results show that all
   jump-mat system produced nearly identical measures of flight time so
   they can be considered valid and reliable for practical purposes. In
   comparison, Chronojump showed the best performance whereas Axon showed
   enough variability and disagreement to pose a problem in testing elite
   athletes. Conclusions: These experiments show that open-source jump mats
   are as valid and reliable as their proprietary counterparts at a lower
   cost. Therefore, practitioners can be confident in using Globus or
   Chronojump systems to test athletes' jump height because of their
   negligible errors and Axon system to monitor general population.}},

Abstract = {{Some countries in South America such as Ecuador, Colombia and Peru have
   increased their presence in the production and export of orchids.
   Ecuador has 14\% of the world's species and in 2014 its orchid exports
   increased 8\%, this shows the importance of this product for the
   country. An orchid greenhouse is a botanical garden specialized in the
   cultivation, preservation and exhibition of orchids, these places
   require that physical variables such as ambient temperature, humidity
   and illuminance to be continuously monitored and controlled for the
   proper growth of orchids. The present work proposes the design,
   prototyping and deployment of a wireless sensor network for the
   monitoring of physical variables in the Municipal orchid greenhouse of
   Loja, based on open hardware technology. As a result, two prototypes
   were implemented: one from the variable monitoring node and the other
   from the central node for visualization and recording of variables. For
   the validation of the prototypes, performance tests were carried out in
   the field. Approximately 3000 samples were obtained with a 100\%
   reliability rate in the transit of the data within the process of
   acquisition, transmission, reception and storage.}},

Abstract = {{The pumping system of the Administration Board of Drinking Water and
   Sanitation of the Algarrobera (JAAPS-LA) is made up of a cylindrical
   aquifer with dimensions of 70 meters deep and 0.305 meters in diameter,
   the central element of this system is the submersible pump electrical,
   which is controlled by time. This current system has some deficiencies,
   among them the shortage of drinking water when the demand of the users
   is higher than the nominal one; and the large waste of potable water
   when the demand is lower than the nominal one. The present work proposes
   the design, implementation and integration of a monitoring and
   automation system applied to the JAAPS-LA pumping system, based on a
   wireless sensor network, open hardware and a PLC. As a result, all the
   modules of the system were implemented: the liquid level acquisition
   module in the distribution tank by means of liquid level sensors; the
   wireless data transmission and reception module; the drive module of the
   pump by means of the Programmable logic controller (PLC); and, finally,
   the solar-photovoltaic energy capture module. To evaluate the
   performance of the monitoring and automation system implemented, the
   behavior was monitored for 4 days, with the data obtained it was
   possible to verify the correct pump drive logic and the high efficiency
   (100\%) of the communication system.}},

Abstract = {{This work describes how a low cost equipment, a LEGO Mindstorms NXT kit,
   has been used to teach VAL II, which is a standard programming language
   for industrial robots. Previously, the students had programmed the
   embedded system that moves the LEGO robot arms. Thus, they may compare
   programming the controller (the NXT brick, in NXC) and programming the
   industrial robot to execute a specific trajectory (the VAL II program).
   For that reason, the authors designed a software architecture that
   includes a wrapper to encapsulate the most relevant commands of VAL II
   and a programming environment. The wrapper was implemented for the same
   two degrees of freedom SCARA robot that students had already used. The
   software architecture provides the following functionalities: (1)
   simulate the trajectories by means of a simple graphical engine; (2)
   execute VAL II programs in a 2DoF LEGO robot; and (3) create a low cost
   remote laboratory.}},

Abstract = {{Suborbital missions of sounding rockets along the parabolic trajectory
   are commonly used for the Earth's near space environment research or for
   the astrophysical observations with the time duration only in the order
   of several minutes. Such short-term missions are usually performed with
   a low-cost equipment as the exact opposite of long-term satellite
   missions with high-end and expensive technologies. In this paper there
   is described the usage of a low-cost industrial CMOS camera for the
   confirmation of accurate pointing of the Roentgen telescope during the
   Vela supernova observation. It requires a robust method of the image
   post-processing and the compensation of real properties of the camera
   system faced to the extreme space environment. Also a specific mode of
   the image acquisition is required due to temperature changes during the
   suborbital mission. As the result of our work, a low-cost camera could
   be used for simple and short-term tasks in space instead of an expensive
   space qualified system.}},

   ensure that all the involved operations are done in real time. IEC-61499
   standard seeks the maximum compatibility among the devices that works
   under it. This is done by generating a series of generic functions under
   high level programming languages, making it possible to develop high
   complexity algorithms. The standard's main requirement for its
   implementation, is the use of a control device with an embedded
   software. The research presents a low-cost hardware reutilization, based
   on the develop under IEC-61499 standard of a control function
   encapsulating a MPC algorithm and communication functions that allow a
   development card Raspberry Pi 3B to take full control of the
   Programmable Logic Controller's (PLC) operation involved in the pump
   control of an oil pipeline pumping station, making it possible to
   combine the physical strengths of a PLC with the processing capabilities
   of an embedded controller.}},

Abstract = {{It is suggested to improve the level of security by applying the open
   source paradigm to the entire IT supply chain and by subjecting the
   resulting components to verification when required. This would lead to a
   new trajectory for IT product development which could even increase the
   efficiency of addressing novel types of hardware-oriented attacks or
   employing stealthy hardware features. This could require increased
   transparency of semiconductor fabs. For designing open hardware several
   nuclei already exist. The proposed path would hold particular promise
   for security-critical components, which could be specified in such a way
   as to precisely match hardware characteristics. As some components would
   continue to be built using existing components for some time, a
   generalized a priori statement about the security of the complete supply
   chain, such as ``verified{''} or ``proven{''}, will initially be
   impossible.}},

Abstract = {{The inclusion of pupils with special educational needs (SEN) in
   classrooms is a reality for many teachers. These professionals have a
   favourable attitude towards the inclusion of pupils with SEN in the
   regular teaching classrooms.
   An inclusive education system should be ``structured and developed
   taking into account the diversity of characteristics of young children,
   different needs or problems{''} and for these reasons to differentiate
   measures.
   Special education is aimed at educational and social inclusion,
   educational access and success, autonomy, emotional stability, as well
   as the promotion of equal opportunities, preparation for continuing
   education or adequate preparation for the professional life and for a
   transition from school to employment of children and young people with
   permanent special educational needs{''}.
   A particular case of SEN is that of people with autism, and they
   characterize autism as ``a rare and serious psychiatric illness in
   childhood and characterized by imbalanced intellectual development that
   affects the ability to socialize.{''} It is also reported in the
   literature that these people, with autism, have great difficulties in
   communicating verbal and nonverbal, while having a great difficulty in
   interpreting language.
   Technology-based learning, in particular through the use of visual and
   multimedia environments, is a facilitating tool for people with autism
   spectrum disorders to learn best when information is presented visually.
   This view is also shared by several authors when refer that to
   facilitate ``inclusion and children / young people with SEN in today's
   society, Information and Communication Technologies play a fundamental
   role, as they facilitate a differentiated, active and collaborative
   intervention of all stakeholders in the life of each of these
   people{''}.
   This document reports on an activity project that can be used by
   Educators of students with autism. Two tools are used, Makey-Makey
   hardware and Scratch software. The use of open-hardware
   microcontrollers, with no need for programming and free software, allows
   this project to be shared and reconverted to other topics. This work
   arose from a challenge of proposing an activity to be used by children
   with special educational needs using ICT. In a first step the
   bibliography related to the use of ICT in the classroom with these
   children and the legislation that served to obtain the first
   orientations was consulted. Then a specialist was consulted and then the
   prototype of the project was built, succinct enough that it could be
   replicated and perceived by these Educators.}},

Abstract = {{The Army continues the development of 3D printing technology to enhance
   the capability to produce smaller and lighter precision weaponry.
   Researchers and support organizations that are affiliated with the Army
   Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center
   (AMRDEC) are developing nano based structures and components for
   advanced weaponry, aviation, and autonomous air/ground systems
   applications. The first key area consists of determining in-plane and
   out-of-plane shear properties of test articles made by 3D printing
   (Fused Deposition Modeling - FDM) and comparing to the conventional
   extrusion/forming sheet process. Test specimens are made from three
   polymer materials: acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), high impact
   poly-styrene (HIPS), and poly-lactic acid (PLA). Laboratory testing is
   performed according to the ASTM D3846-02 method for determining the
   in-plane shear strength, while the ASTM D5379 method is used for
   determining the out-of-plane shear properties. A description on how the
   3D printing process advances the shear properties and has the potential
   of improving the in-plane and cross-sectional shear properties over the
   conventional manufacturing process is presented. The second key area
   demonstrates a set of materials, processes, and techniques that support
   the enabling of additive manufacture (AM) of RF components. Research
   activities are focused on developing open-source hardware/software
   multi-material direct digital printing, and producing 3D printed
   antenna, passive components, and connectors for C-band and Ku-band
   systems. Material studies have demonstrated a suitable material set for
   RF components and identified key material performance limits. Results
   show how more enhancement could be achieved by optimizing the variables
   that affect 3D printing.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the practical realization of energy beamforming gains in
   the downlink wireless power transfer from a massive antenna radio
   frequency (RF) source to multiple single antenna energy harvesting (EH)
   users. Assuming channel reciprocity for the uplink and downlink channels
   undergoing Rician fading, we first obtain the least-squares and
   linear-minimum-mean-square-error channel estimates using the
   energy-constrained pilot signal transmission from EH users. Due to the
   usage of low cost hardware at the users and for realizing massive
   antenna system at the RF source, these estimates are strongly influenced
   by the transmitter and receiver in-phase-and-quadrature-phase imbalance
   (IQI). Using these channel estimates, we next derive the harvested power
   at each user by applying the source transmit precoding that maximizes
   the sum harvested power among the users. Selected results generated
   considering practical RF EH system parameters show that IQI and channel
   estimation errors can lead to about 30\% degradation in the sum EH
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Because of the great popularity of the maker movement, the concept of
   ``Do it yourself{''} (DIY) has gained considerable public attention.
   Furthermore, because of the development of rapid prototyping, the rise
   of open-source hardware and programming languages, the popularization of
   network communities, and the establishment of maker spaces, DIY has been
   taken to the next level: ``co-creation.{''} This concept requires reform
   to the standard curriculum in information and technology education.
   Therefore, this study aims to define the key competences of makers to
   construct the competence indicators of Maker Education for information
   and technology education in elementary school. On this basis, a
   curriculum can be developed, and an evaluation system for learning
   effectiveness can be built to equip students with the abilities to adapt
   to life and tackle challenges. In this study, the Fuzzy Delphi Method
   (FDM) was applied to collect and analyze data in the form of a
   questionnaire survey. The subjects were 12 experts from enterprises,
   governmental institutions, schools and research institutes. The research
   achievements include 3 factors ({''}Theoretical knowledge,{''}
   ``Practical application,{''} ``Maker's mindset{''}), and 10 indicators.}},

Abstract = {{Attitude control is an important part in satellite on-orbit operation.
   It greatly affects the performance of satellites. Testing of an attitude
   determination and control subsystem (ADCS) is very challenging since it
   might require attitude dynamics and space environment in the orbit. This
   paper develops a low-cost hardware-in-loop (HIL) simulator for testing
   an ADCS of a CubeSat satellite. The simulator consists of a numerical
   simulation part, a hardware part, and a HIL interface hardware unit. The
   numerical simulation part includes orbital dynamics, attitude dynamics
   and Earth's magnetic field. The hardware part is the real ADCS board of
   the satellite. The simulation part outputs satellite's angular velocity
   and geomagnetic field information to the HIL interface hardware. Then,
   based on this information, the HIL interface hardware generates I2C
   signals mimicking the signals of the on-board rate-gyros and
   magnetometers and consequently outputs the signals to the ADCS board.
   The ADCS board reads the rate-gyro and magnetometer signals, calculates
   control signals, and drives the attitude actuators which are three
   magnetic torquers (MTQs). The responses of the MTQs sensed by a
   separated magnetometer are feedback to the numerical simulation part
   completing the HIL simulation loop. Experimental studies are conducted
   to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the simulator.}},

Abstract = {{The OS scheduler's memory and runtime overheads form crucial design
   constraints for embedded systems implemented on low-cost hardware
   platforms. Table-driven scheduling can provide a high level of
   schedulability; however, it also consumes significant amounts of memory.
   By contrast, effective non-preemptive scheduling policies, such as the
   non-work-conserving Critical-Window EDF (CW-EDF), have low memory usage,
   but substantial runtime overheads. This paper aims to achieve efficient
   and effective non-preemptive scheduling by using a First-In-First-Out
   (FIFO) scheduling policy combined with a novel offset tuning technique.
   This technique enables the FIFO policy to reproduce a given feasible
   schedule, such as that followed by CW-EDF, resulting in a high level of
   schedulability, combined with comparatively low runtime overheads.
   Further, by using a small number of offsets per task, memory overheads
   are also tightly constrained. The proposed solution is evaluated in
   terms of runtime overhead, memory consumption, and schedulability ratio,
   using a prototype implementation on an Arduino board. This shows that
   FIFO with offset tuning can match the schedulability ratio of CW-EDF,
   while typically exhibiting lower scheduling overheads and memory
   consumption than the state-of-the-art Offline Equivalence technique,
   which is based on Non-Preemptive Fixed Priority (NP-FP) scheduling.}},

Abstract = {{Envisioned communication densities in Internet of Things applications
   are increasing continuously. Because these wireless devices are often
   battery powered, we need specific energy efficient (low-power)
   solutions. Moreover, these smart objects use low-cost hardware with
   possibly weak links, leading to a lossy network. Once deployed, these
   low-power lossy networks (LLNs) are intended to collect the expected
   measurements, handle transient faults, topology changes, etc.
   Consequently, validation and verification during the protocol
   development are a matter of prime importance. A large range of
   theoretical or practical tools are available for performance evaluation.
   A theoretical analysis may demonstrate that the performance guarantees
   are respected, while simulations or experiments aim on estimating the
   behaviour of a set of protocols within real-world scenarios. In this
   paper, we review the various parameters that should be taken into
   account during such a performance evaluation. Our primary purpose is to
   provide a tutorial that specifies guidelines for conducting performance
   evaluation campaigns of network protocols in LLNs. We detail the general
   approach adopted in order to evaluate the performance of layer 2 and 3
   protocols in LLNs. Furthermore, we also specify the methodology that
   should be adopted during the performance evaluation, while reviewing the
   numerous models and tools that are available to the research community.}},

Abstract = {{The main aim of this paper depicts in design and implementation of the
   Extended Kalman Filter for a nonlinear system in an application of a
   sensor fusion from a practical point of view. The sensor fusion is a
   typical data processing problem in mechanical systems where individual
   measurements of (angular) positions, velocities or accelerations are
   done independently on each other but the measured values are correlated
   to each other via dynamics of the system. Moreover, the measurement is
   corrupted by noise. The sensor fusion technique is capable to gain
   proper information about positions, velocities or accelerations from
   inaccurate measurement. In background of the sensor fusion algorithm, in
   our particular case, works the Extended Kalman Filter. Its adaptation
   for a simple mechanical system represented by a nonlinear system are
   object of the research in this paper related to usage of the Extended
   Kalman Filter on a low cost hardware. (C) 2018, IFAC (International

Abstract = {{The usage of real-time tracking systems for vehicles has demonstrated to
   be a viable and economical option, entailing in more control and
   management of the fleet, plus the reduction of the logistics costs of
   companies using them. Since 2006 in Cuba, there is a fleet control and
   management system employed by almost all the companies, which hire a
   variant of the service in a differed manner; i.e., the data are not
   processed in real-time. In this research paper, we propose the design of
   a device based only on open source hardware/software components allowing
   the real-time vehicle tracking. Our proposal is suitable for the
   conditions of the country where it was developed (Cuba), presenting high
   functionality than other proposals. For the design, we employed an
   Arduino UNO controller board, an Adafruit FONA808 GPS/GSM module, and
   other accessories. As per the performed experiments, the proposed
   hardware/software architecture complies with the operation,
   configuration, and security requirements to achieve a viable product

Abstract = {{Maker Education is a practice-oriented movement that has risen in the
   last decade, and emphasizes more on innovation, creativity and problem
   solving. Maker Education is based on knowledge, directed by creation,
   and is aimed at solving problems. This study, aimed at the curriculum of
   the Department of Information Management, expects to develop a
   systematic information Maker curriculum. This curriculum, combined with
   the 3D printing machine and Arduino open hardware configured with the
   STEM education framework, is designed to explore the impact of the
   introduction of Maker education to information curriculum of technical
   or vocational colleges on attitude differences and learning of STEM. Two
   courses, 3D model design and Arduino programming, are implemented, after
   the end of which, students' achievements are evaluated. The result is
   that male still have higher interests in science, engineering and
   technology than women, but Maker curriculum is multifaceted and
   foundational so that many people can spend a little time in learning and
   use various skills to produce their own works. Therefore, there is
   little difference between women and men in scores of achievement test.}},

Title = {{An Efficient Estimator for Target Localization in a Multistation
   Redundancy System without Matrix Inversion}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SENSORS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{2018}},
Abstract = {{This paper focuses on target localization problem in a multistation
   redundancy system which finds broad applications in sonar, radar, and
   location-based service. Previous solutions can only be applied to the
   minimum system, such as the TOA method with three sensors and the AOA
   method with two sensors or need matrix inversion. To solve this problem,
   we propose a simple closed-form solution for a multistation redundancy
   localization system by using the estimation variance as the weighting
   coefficient to compute an average of each group's localization result.
   The proposed method, with simple algebraic solution, requires no matrix
   inversion and can be used for low-cost hardware devices. We derive the
   method in TOA solution and AOA solution, respectively. The proposed
   method can also be extended to other locating technologies. Numerical
   examples are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed
   method in root-mean-square error. The positioning accuracy of the
   proposed method is close to Cramer-Rao low bound both in TOA solution
   and AOA solution.}},

   the reliability and availability of WSN sensor nodes. However,
   augmenting sensor nodes with a redundancy mechanism increases the cost

   reliability without increasing costs, we investigate three dual modular
   redundancy systems using low-cost hardware and a heartbeat mechanism
   with a UART and direct UDP channels. The proposed systems exhibit three
   advantages - low latency, cost-effectiveness, and easy configuration. We

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a cost-effective implementation method of a
   ball and plate system as an educational kit and present the application
   of sliding mode control to achieve better control performance. We choose
   a Stewart platform with rotary actuators to manipulate the plate. We
   explain the construction method of the platform in detail. We use a
   touch panel as a sensor to obtain the positional data at a high sample
   rate and to make the system compact. As a main control unit, we use a
   Nucleo-32 board, which is a small and powerful open source hardware with
   a built-in floating point unit. For controller synthesis, we show a
   mathematical model of the ball and plate system and explain the
   kinematics analysis of the Stewart platform. We design a sliding mode
   controller that includes error integration, which makes the system
   robust against external disturbances. We describe the results of the
   simulations and the experiments and then illustrate the advantage of the
   applied sliding mode control compared to LQ control. The proposed system
   is cost-effective, can be easily built, has good control performance,
   and occupies a small space. For these reasons, we expect that the system
   can be efficiently used as an educational tool.}},

Journal = {{FME TRANSACTIONS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{525-529}},
Abstract = {{We present a method for microfluidic channel fabrication that has the
   following advantages compared to conventionally-used methods: technical
   simplicity, dramatically lower fabrication costs, and fabrication time.
   The method entails printing channel designs on a thermoplastic film from
   a LaserJet printer. Exposure to high temperatures elicits isotropic
   shrinkage of the film (in the x-y plane), in addition to thickening (in
   the z-direction), resulting in a positive relief mold. The microfluidic
   channel design of the mold is then transferred to a polydimethyl
   siloxane (PDMS) chip through soft lithography, resulting in a
   ready-to-use microfluidic chip. Through this approach, chips with
   complex channel geometries can be generated with low cost equipment and
   in as little as a couple hours. Flow visualizations from several chips
   from the ``Do-it-yourself Microfluidics Workshop{''}, held at the
   Faculty of Mechanical Engineering Univeristy of Belgrade, are presented
   in this paper. We also discuss possibilities for adapting micro particle
   image velocimetry (PIV) measurements to channel designs on PDMS-based
   microfluidic chips using the fabrication method delineated here.}},

Abstract = {{In 2013 the Competition for Authenticated Encryption: Security,
   Applicability, and Robustness (CAESAR) was started. It aims at
   determining a portfolio of ciphers for authenticated encryption that has
   advantages over AES-GCM in terms of performance, security, and ease of
   implementation. This competition, for the first time, provides a
   standardized hardware API, which allows a fair comparison of hardware
   implementations. However, the community still lacks a common platform to
   automatically test hardware implementations, confirm implementation
   claims, and benchmark performance figures on real hardware in terms of
   runtime, area, power and energy consumption. In this work, we present a
   common platform using the CAESAR-API in a Xilinx Zynq-7000 System on
   Chip (SoC) with ARM processors and an AXI interface. This reflects a
   typical real world usage scenario for hardware-accelerators and thus
   extends the work for a fair comparison of hardware implementations in
   three dimensions: first the API is evaluated on a real SoC, which shows,
   e.g. the performance of the API. Second, it provides a hardware platform
   to test the proposed implementations of the candidates easily. This can
   be used by future designers, as we will provide it as open source
   hardware. Finally, we ran all published hardware implementations of the
   current 3rd-round candidates during which we identified several
   implementation weaknesses, e.g. presumably unintended latches in the
   design, hence emphasizing the importance of testing hardware proposals
   on real hardware.}},

Abstract = {{Nailfold capillaroscopy (NC) is a non-invasive technique used for
   detecting multiple medical disorders such as connective tissue,
   rheumatic and systemic diseases. Current NC methods involve acquiring
   high-resolution images from expensive video capillaroscope for analysis.
   NC analysis on low-resolution images obtained from a low-cost hardware
   is a challenging task. Scale space capillary detectors (SCD) is proposed
   for detection of capillaries under such conditions, which is a unique
   combination of anisotropic diffusion and Harris corner detector. SCD is
   followed by Ordinate clustering algorithm (OCA) which is used to
   eliminate outliers in the detected capillaries. Nailfold capillary
   images are obtained from a low-cost digital microscope under varying
   lighting conditions to form a custom database. Experimental results show
   the promising performance of the proposed algorithm with a high
   true-positive detection rate and a low false-negative detection rate.}},

Abstract = {{An automated machine vision-based system for the recognition and sorting
   of small parts was designed, assembled and tested. The system was
   developed to address a need to expose engineering students to the issues
   of machine vision and assembly automation technology, with readily
   available and relatively low-cost hardware and software. This paper
   outlines the design of the system and presents experimental performance
   results. Three different styles of plastic gears, together with three
   different styles of defective gears, were used to test the system. A
   pattern matching tool was used for part classification. Nine experiments
   were conducted to demonstrate the effects of changing various hardware
   and software parameters, including: conveyor speed, gear feed rate,
   classification, and identification score thresholds. It was found that
   the system could achieve a maximum system accuracy of 95\% at a feed
   rate of 60 parts/min, for a given set of parameter settings. Future work
   will be looking at the effect of lighting.}},

   approach for high fidelity 3D point cloud generation using low cost 3D
   sensing hardware is presented. The proposed approach runs in an
   efficient low-cost hardware setting based on several Kinect v2 scanners
   connected to a single PC. It performs autocalibration and runs in
   real-time exploiting an efficient composition of several filtering
   methods including Radius Outlier Removal (ROR), Weighted Median filter
   (WM) and Weighted Inter-Frame Average filtering (WIFA). The performance
   of the proposed method has been demonstrated through efficient

Abstract = {{To compensate the high path loss in millimeter wave (mmWave) systems,
   large antenna arrays are used. In such circumstances, low cost hardware

   This paper proposes an algorithm to enhance the efficiency of OMP

Abstract = {{In system engineering education, physical computing and problem-based
   learning are used successfully for some time. These concepts are
   especially suitable for programming novices and computer science
   non-major students. However, their broad adoption in universities
   requires access to affordable low-cost hardware. But for courses
   specific to the automotive domain, usually specific and expensive
   hardware and toolchains are required. Therefore, in this paper an
   approach is presented simulating real-world embedded systems by low-cost
   single-board computer hardware and allowing the students to focus on the
   essential elements of the system design. A customized teaching scenario
   including a laboratory vehicle based on low-cost hardware enables
   practical lessons in the area of ``Connected Car Applications{''}
   (Car2x). The evaluation results demonstrate the practical feasibility
   and its strong acceptance and positive influence on the learning
   success.}},

Abstract = {{Highly developed drone technology enables the use of drones in a wide
   variety of areas. However, those drones are mainly used in the unmanned
   aerial vehicles. We believe that underwater drones will become a big
   research topic and find a market in the near future. We developed an
   underwater drone with a 360 degrees panoramic camera acting as the
   ``eye{''} of the drone. The designs are based on the open-source
   hardware and will be shared as an open-source for contributing to the
   innovation of manufacturing including drone. The function of the 360
   degrees panoramic camera is generated by correcting the images taken by
   two fisheye lenses. The underwater drone was designed by extending the
   Raspberry Pi compute module, the frame was designed by OpenSCAD, and the
   printed circuit board was designed by MakePro. As for the application of
   the underwater drone, we focused on fish recognition for investigating
   fish species in a natural lake to help protect the original environment.
   Fish recognition is based on deep learning, which is the biggest topic
   in the artificial intelligence research field today. Experimental
   results show that the function of the underwater drone achieved at
   diving in the leak automatically. The 360 degrees panoramic images were
   generated correctly. Fish recognition achieved 87\% accuracy by deep
   learning.}},

Pages = {{387-390}},
Abstract = {{Low-cost biosensors combined with low-cost portable devices can be very
   useful in time critical situations of mass casualties, when fast triage
   procedure must be attained. A methodology that uses ECG to derive the
   vital parameters ( heart rate and respiratory rate) needed for the
   triage procedure is presented and it is aimed to leverage affordable
   low-cost equipment that can be easily utilized by urgent medical units
   or even volunteers in events of considerable number of injured
   civilians. The methodology relies on selected well-known and published
   algorithms for heart rate and respiratory rate derivation from a given
   ECG signal. It consists of methods for R-wave detection, kurtosis
   computation, smoothing, and finding peaks. The proposed approach is
   shown to offer a good trade-off between the accurate measurement of the
   parameters and their fast derivation. It has been evaluated by using a
   publicly available database. Its robustness is measured in terms of
   accuracy estimation, showing a sensitivity of 0.87 for heart rate and
   0.74 for respiratory rate, a sensitivity of 0.76 considering the triage
   process and an average-case execution time of 0.02 seconds, making it
   suitable for real-time applications.}},

Abstract = {{With technology scaling leading to reliability problems and a
   proliferation of hardware accelerators, there is a need for
   cost-effective techniques to detect errors in complex datapaths. Modulo
   (residue) arithmetic is useful for creating a shadow datapath to check
   the computation of an arithmetic datapath and involves three key steps:
   reduction of the inputs to modulo shadow inputs, computation with those
   shadow values, and checking the outputs for consistency with the shadow
   outputs. The focus of this paper is new gate-level architectures and
   algorithms to reduce the cost of modulo shadow datapaths. We introduce
   low-cost architectures for all four key functional units in a shadow
   datapath: (1) a modulo reduction algorithm that generates architectures
   consisting entirely of full-adder standard cells; (2) minimum-area
   modulo adder and subtractor architectures; (3) an array-based modulo
   multiplier design; and (4) a modulo equality comparator that handles the
   residue encoding produced by the above. We compare our functional units
   to the previous state-of-the-art approach, observing a 12.5\% reduction
   in area and a 47.1\% reduction in delay for a 32-bit mod-3 reducer; that
   our reducer costs, which tend to dominate shadow datapath costs, do not
   increase with larger modulo bases; and that for modulo-15 and above, all
   of our modulo functional units have better area and delay then their
   previous counterparts. We also demonstrate the practicality of our
   approach by designing a custom shadow datapath for error detection of a
   multiply accumulate functional unit, which has an area overhead of only
   12\% for a 32-bit main datapath and 2-bit modulo-3 shadow datapath.}},

Abstract = {{Earthquake effects are strongly related with the properties of the local
   geology, amplifying the ground motion, especially in soft soils. This
   amplification is connected with the resonant frequency, which can be
   estimated applying the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (1-1/V)
   method on seismic noise measurements. In this work, a low-cost
   user-friendly data acquisition system (Geophonino-3D) has been designed
   for three-component seismic noise recording. The developed system
   consists of the signal conditioning circuit and the Arduino Due with an
   SD Shield for data storage. The suitability of the equipment for the
   application of the H/V method has been first assessed in the laboratory,
   according to the experimental sensitivity, the internal noise stability
   and the channel consistency. Subsequently, experimental verification has
   been carried out by recording seismic noise at eight different sites
   along the province of Alicante (southeast Spain), with different soil
   characteristics. The performance of the developed acquisition system has
   been evaluated in terms of the power spectral density and the H/V peaks
   by comparison with the results obtained through a commercial seismic
   recorder. The obtained results show the applicability of the developed
   acquisition system to record seismic noise and to apply the H/V method.
   Geophonino-3D is an open source and open hardware system and the price
   of its components is much lower than any other commercial equipment,
   which becomes a significant advance especially for small research groups
   with reduced economic support. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   Self-Powered Systems}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In self-powered microsystems, a power management is essential to
   extract, transfer and regulate power from energy harvesting sources to
   loads such as sensors. The challenge is to consider all of the different
   structures and components available and build the optimal power
   management on a microscale. The purpose of this paper is to streamline
   the design process by creating a novel reconfigurable testbed called
   Medlay. First, we propose a uniform interface for management functions
   e.g., power conversion, energy storing and power routing. This interface
   results in a clear layout because power and status pins are strictly
   separated, and inputs and outputs have fixed positions. Medlay is the
   ready-to-use and open-hardware platform based on the interface. It
   consists of a base board and small modules incorporating e.g., dc-dc
   converters, power switches and supercapacitors. Measurements confirm
   that Medlay represents a system on one circuit board, as parasitic
   effects of the interconnections are negligible. The versatility
   regarding different setups on the testbed is determined to over 250,000
   combinations by layout graph grammar. Lastly, we underline the
   applicability by recreating three state-of-the-art systems with the
   testbed. In conclusion, Medlay facilitates building and testing power
   management in a very compact, clear and extensible fashion.}},

   The proposed system utilizes low-level data from radar sensors as well
   as indirect (e.g. 3D imaging) and direct (e.g. LIDAR) Time-of-Flight
   (ToF) sensors. After a configurable amount of pre-processing at
   sensor-level, the sensor data is transferred to a centralized platform
   and aligned temporally and spatially. We demonstrate the transformation
   of radar data into the 3D coordinate system in order to fuse it with
   point cloud data from ToF sensors. Due to the modular structure of the
   framework, it also enables the exploration of various system

Abstract = {{In developing state of the art applications for Internet of Things (IoT)
   and Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), most applications software and
   associated hardware are always developed from ground up. However, this
   approach always involves huge capital outlay, extend time-to-market for
   products, and contribute to integration delay, especially in the case of
   Industrial IoT (IIoT). In this paper, it is shown that already existing,
   widely-available, and low-cost hardware can participate successfully in
   collaborative computing for new analytics applications, at edges of IIoT
   and CPS networks. A well-known, low-cost, embedded digital signal
   processor (DSP) that is fully integrated in many industries is selected
   and used as a case study. The selected DSP is made more scalable by
   applying it to new, novel uses at the edge of an IIoT network. The new
   application includes using it to design useful waveforms needed for
   collaborative computing at IIoT network edges. Embedded-C, a programming
   language that is suitable for programming resource-constrained network
   edge devices is used to successfully design needed waveforms for the
   selected DSP. Collaborative computing is achieved by sending the
   designed waveforms from the network edge, across diverse communication
   channels, to the fog layer, and then, use it at the fog layer to remove
   noise in selected IIoT data. Correlation coefficient is positive and
   high between output of noise removal achieved by waveforms from the
   low-cost DSP when compared to noise removal achieved by waveforms from
   systems with more computing resources at the fog layer. This signifies a
   successful collaborative computing using such legacy, low-cost DSP. For
   low-cost hardware to participate successfully in distributed, real-time
   collaborative network edge-computing, impact of communication network
   disturbances must be examined. Hence, for the selected DSP, impact of
   network Bit Error Rate (BER) is examined for both wired and wireless
   networks. It is discovered that wireless channels have lesser BER than
   powerline communication (PLC) channels that have impulsive noises.
   Hence, it may be more suitable for real-time fault-tolerant
   collaborative computing using the selected DSP.}},

Abstract = {{Electromyography deals with the detection, analysis and use of the

   Electromyographic (EMG) signals have applications in many areas.
   Electromyographs can be very bulky and expensive. There are many
   alternatives to professional electromyographs, both commercial and
   academic. However, these options are still too expensive, have too few
   or a single channel. The objective of this work is to implement a
   low-cost multichannel surface EMG acquisition platform. The platform
   must have high-quality, scalability, analog-to-digital conversion and
   the possibility to run both in stand-alone mode and connected to a
   computer via USB interface. The proposed platform has three main
   components: dedicated acquisition board, Tiva module and acquisition
   software. We validate the proposed acquisition board design by testing
   its frequency response, circuit amplification and common mode rejection
   rate.}},

Abstract = {{Modern technologies of nowadays permanently ask for continual
   modification of teaching methods especially in the field of computer
   science. If teacher and students would like to follow the latest trends
   in this fast-growing and quick-changing area, teaching methods should be
   permanently developed. Technologies as Internet of Things (IoT), Web
   Design, Machine Learning or other current machineries constantly suffer
   from the lack of talented and skilled developers to independently manage
   and execute such projects. The situation reflects, on the one hand, to
   the deficiency of students willing to study these areas, on the other
   hand, to the ability of teachers to successfully adapt new trends from
   these areas into the education process. Based on our experience, it is
   possible to claim, that students can be easily motivated to work at all
   kind of applications if a way of their engagement is entertaining and
   pleasurable. Small and cheap mobile robotic platforms can serve this
   purpose. When the students can play with something what provides real
   feedback to them - blinking LED diode, lighting-up display, turning
   motors - they are motivated to work on it and consequently to learn
   something. It is called teaching by experience. With regards to
   mentioned, our team developed and introduced the mobile robotic platform
   applicable for showing the students basic principles of IoT application
   development. Upon the simple tasks, students first learn how to, through
   an introduced application programming interface (API), operate all the
   robot hardware. Afterwards they are headed for setting up their first
   application when they need to set up the server application and
   graphical user interface (GUI), implement the communication protocol and
   program the robot logic. The paper describes the platform in detail as
   well as the first experiences with its puffing into practice.}},

Abstract = {{Yrobot is an open hardware platform developed by authors of this paper
   for students of computer science field of study. It was spread across
   high schools and universities in Slovakia for the purposes of teaching
   electronics and microcontrollers programming. The platform serves the
   purpose of a kit on which students can step-by-step gather some basic
   knowledge about the problematic of embedded systems development. They
   learn how to write, compile and transfer the code from computer into the
   microcontroller, as well as how to access all robot peripherals and how
   to implement the programming logic. C and C++ programming languages are
   used for this purpose. After the students goes through all programming
   tasks, they are skilled enough and pushed to design their own shield for
   Yrobot - supplementary hardware which provides additional functionality
   for the robot. The shield is connected via the expansion connectors to
   the robot and obviously improves the robot operation. In this paper, the
   implementation process of RaspberryPi extension for Yrobot is described.
   Such extension enables interconnection between the robot and RapberryPi
   which serves sufficient computing power enabling the robot of a
   real-time computer vision. Upon such prerequisites, special application
   which allows the robot to recognize the traffic signs was developed. On
   this application students gathered special knowledge of how to work with
   OpenCV library.}},

Abstract = {{We have attempted to create affordable programmable logical controllers
   (PLC) that can be used to train millions of students in developing
   countries. Version 1 of the PLC is based on AtMega16 and costs (sic)600
   (\$10). Using the free and open source software (FOSS) LD Micro, one can
   learn ladder logic. To enhance the capabilities, using Raspberry PI,
   Version 2 of the PLC, costing (sic)1,500 (\$25) is made. We can use this
   device with the FOSS OpenPLC to learn ladder logic. We can also learn
   function block based programming using the FOSS 4DIAC. As ladder logic
   and function block based programming are industrial standards, students
   trained using our approach will be useful to industry.}},

Abstract = {{Virtual reality (VR) is resurging in popularity with the advancement of
   low-cost hardware and more realistic graphics. How might this technology
   help others? That is, to increase mental well-being? The ultimate VR
   might look like lucid dreaming, the phenomenon of knowing one is
   dreaming while in the dream. Lucid dreaming can be used as an
   introspective tool and, ultimately, increase mental well-being. What
   these introspective experiences are like for lucid dreamers might be key
   in determining specific design guidelines for future creation of a
   technological tool used for helping people examine their own thoughts
   and emotions. This study describes nine active and proficient lucid
   dreamers' representations of their introspective experiences gained
   through phenomenological interviews. Four major themes emerged:
   sensations and feelings, actions and practices, influences on
   experience, and meaning making This knowledge can help design a VR

Abstract = {{After a long-term debate and almost two years of legislative work, the
   Revenue Registry Act was adopted in the Czech Republic. The first and
   main reason for introducing the revenue registry was the lack of
   instruments of the Tax Administration to fight tax evasions. The second
   reason was the elimination of unfair competition based on gain of undue
   advantage by not paying the value added tax (VAT) and the income tax.
   The system of the revenue registry in the Czech Republic is founded on
   several principles that distinguish it from other systems based on a
   cash register or other systems of electronic evidence. The revenue
   registry is based on the principles of electronisation, on-line access
   of tax administrator to information, the possibility of voluntary public
   involvement into oversight and open hardware and software solution.
   Unfortunately, shortly after the adoption by the Parliament, the group
   of legislators started a case at the Constitutional Court, demanding the
   abolition of the Revenue Registry Act or at least some parts of the Act
   because of its unconstitutionality. They were partially successful and
   now the Ministry of Finance has been tasked with the preparation of an
   amendment to the Act. The goal of this contribution is to briefly
   introduce and describe the Revenue Registry Act, critically analyse the
   fundamental provisions of the Act, summarize pros and cons of the
   regulation, critically analyse the decision of the Constitutional Court
   and introduce the Ministry's proposal of amendments. The hypothesis that
   the electronic revenue registry is an effective tool for fair tax
   payments was neither confirmed nor disproved: The electronic revenue
   registry might be an effective tool for fair tax payments, but only in
   case of unified rules for all businessmen. The higher the number of
   exemptions is, the less effective tool the revenue registry is.}},

Abstract = {{A new analytical procedure, based on liquid chromatography with diode
   array and fluorescence detection, has been proposed for the
   determination of bioactive compounds in vegetables and spices after hard
   cap espresso extraction. This novel extraction system has been tested
   for the determination of capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin from fresh
   chilli and sweet pepper, piperine from ground pepper, curcumin from
   turmeric and curry, and myristicin from nutmeg. Extraction efficiency
   was evaluated by using acetonitrile: water and ethanol: water mixtures.
   The proposed method allows the extraction of samples with 100 mL of 60\%
   (v/v) ethanol in water. The obtained limits of quantification for the
   proposed procedure ranged from 0.07 to 0.30 mg g(-1) and results were
   statistically comparable with those obtained by ultrasound assisted
   extraction. Hard cap espresso machines offer a fast, effective and
   quantitative tool for the extraction of bioactive compounds from food
   samples with an extraction time lower than 30 s, using a global
   available and low cost equipment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Reliability of doming and toe flexion testing to quantify foot muscle
   strength}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FOOT AND ANKLE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{DEC 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: Quantifying the strength of the intrinsic foot muscles has
   been a challenge for clinicians and researchers. The reliable
   measurement of this strength is important in order to assess weakness,
   which may contribute to a variety of functional issues in the foot and
   lower leg, including plantar fasciitis and hallux valgus. This study
   reports 3 novel methods for measuring foot strength-doming (previously
   unmeasured), hallux flexion, and flexion of the lesser toes.
   Methods: Twenty-one healthy volunteers performed the strength tests
   during two testing sessions which occurred one to five days apart. Each
   participant performed each series of strength tests (doming, hallux
   flexion, and lesser toe flexion) four times during the first testing
   session (twice with each of two raters) and two times during the second
   testing session (once with each rater). Intra-class correlation
   coefficients were calculated to test for reliability for the following
   comparisons: between raters during the same testing session on the same
   day (inter-rater, intra-day, intra-session), between raters on different
   days (inter-rater, inter-day, inter-session), between days for the same
   rater (intra-rater, inter-day, inter-session), and between sessions on
   the same day by the same rater (intra-rater, intra-day, inter-session).
   Results: ICCs showed good to excellent reliability for all tests between
   days, raters, and sessions. Average doming strength was 99.96 +/- 47.04
   N. Average hallux flexion strength was 65.66 +/- 24.5 N. Average lateral
   toe flexion was 50.96 +/- 22.54 N.
   Conclusions: These simple tests using relatively low cost equipment can
   be used for research or clinical purposes. If repeated testing will be
   conducted on the same participant, it is suggested that the same
   researcher or clinician perform the testing each time for optimal
   reliability.}},

   Scale Acoustic Monitoring Using the Sensor Grid Approach}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The spreading of urban areas and the growth of human population
   worldwide raise societal and environmental concerns. To better address
   these concerns, the monitoring of the acoustic environment in urban as
   well as rural or wilderness areas is an important matter. Building on
   the recent development of low cost hardware acoustic sensors, we propose
   in this paper to consider a sensor grid approach to tackle this issue.
   In this kind of approach, the crucial question is the nature of the data
   that are transmitted from the sensors to the processing and archival
   servers. To this end, we propose an efficient audio coding scheme based
   on third octave band spectral representation that allows: (1) the
   estimation of standard acoustic indicators; and (2) the recognition of
   acoustic events at state-of-the-art performance rate. The former is
   useful to provide quantitative information about the acoustic
   environment, while the latter is useful to gather qualitative
   information and build perceptually motivated indicators using for
   example the emergence of a given sound source. The coding scheme is also
   demonstrated to transmit spectrally encoded data that, reverted to the
   time domain using state-of-the-art techniques, are not intelligible,
   thus protecting the privacy of citizens.}},

   artificially produced hybrids, for which the determination of
   genetically involved species by morphological characteristics is often
   difficult. This necessitates the use of molecular markers for the
   identification of both maternal as well as paternal species, and in the
   case of complex hybrids, the genealogy. For this reason, we developed
   new chloroplast and nuclear markers for the differentiation of up to 19
   poplar species, with one to 32 individuals per species regularly used in
   breeding programs based on already known barcoding, other chloroplast
   regions, and nuclear genes of interest. We developed methods to identify
   species by either species-specific nucleotide variations or, when no
   initial information for the species was given, by using a set of markers
   either in a procedure of exclusion or in a multiplexed marker set. The
   developed markers can all be used with low-cost equipment, and some can
   additionally be applied using a genetic analyzer. We combined these
   markers in multiplexes for a very fast and easy-to-use application for
   the identification of poplar species and their hybrids.}},

Abstract = {{The so-called Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is expected to
   transform our world, and in depth modernize very different domains such
   as manufacturing, energy, agriculture, construction industry, and other
   industrial sectors. The need for low power radio networks first led to
   low duty cycle approaches where nodes turn off their radio chipset most
   of the time to save energy. The medium access control (MAC) has thus
   been largely investigated over the last fifteen years. Unfortunately,
   classical contention access methods use a random access and are unable
   to provide guarantees. In the meantime, some dedicated standards have
   emerged (e.g. IEEE 802.15.4-2006, IEEE 802.15.4-2015), combining Time
   Division Multiple Access (TDMA) with slow channel hopping in order to
   enable reliability and energy efficiency. Slow channel hopping allows
   each node to use different channels for a frame and its possible
   retransmissions with a low-cost hardware. To provide high-reliability,
   these protocols rely on a common schedule in order to prevent
   simultaneously interfering transmissions. In this context, we clearly
   observe a strong growth of the number of proposals in the last years,
   denoting a strong interest of the research community for deterministic
   slow channel hopping scheduling for the IIoT. We categorize here the
   numerous existing solutions according to their objectives (e.g.
   high-reliability, mobility support) and approaches. We also identify
   some open challenges, expected to attract much attention over the next
   few years.}},

Abstract = {{Waste-heat recovery from discharged slurries can improve the net raw
   biogas production in the bio-methane process in order to meet the demand
   for a next-generation of anaerobic digestion. In this study, a numerical
   model of a scraped-surface heat exchanger was proposed with the
   consideration of the complete and precise rheological behaviour of the
   slurry of animal manure for the first time for achieving highly
   efficient waste-heat recovery. The rheological model results were
   verified with new experimental data measured in this work. Subsequently,
   the convective heat-transfer coefficient of the scraped-surface heat
   exchanger was calculated numerically with the proposed numerical model,
   and the performance was determined. Then, the contributions of
   waste-heat recovery from the slurry to the biogas production using a
   general shell-and-tube heat exchanger and the scraped-surface heat
   exchanger were calculated quantitatively and compared. For the case of
   scraped-surface heat exchanger, the increase of net raw biogas
   production can be up to 8.53\%, which indicates that there is a great
   potential to increase the net raw biogas production in the bio-methane
   process using a scraped-surface heat exchanger with low-cost equipment
   and a compactible structure. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   frauds. The experiments were conducted in dairy plants at Governador
   Valadares, in Brazil. The results were compared with cryoscopy and
   chloride tests. It is demonstrated there is high correlation between
   MilkTech and Cryoscopy. For instance, the detection limit of the
   equipment for water addition with the set of analyzed data was 0.78\%
   with precision of 1.1\%. Adulterations with sodium chloride, caustic

Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{Excluding the ion source, an ion mobility spectrometer is fundamentally
   comprised of drift chamber, ion gate, pulsing electronics, and a
   mechanism for amplifying and recording ion signals. Historically, the
   solutions to each of these challenges have been custom and rarely
   replicated exactly. For the IMS research community few detailed
   resources exist that explicitly detail the construction and operation of
   ion mobility systems. In an effort to address this knowledge gap we
   outline a solution to one of the key aspects of a drift tube ion
   mobility system, the ion gate pulser. Bradbury-Nielsen or Tyndall ion
   gates are found in nearly every research-grade and commercial IMS
   system. While conceptually simple, these gate structures often require
   custom, high-voltage, floating electronics. In this report we detail the
   operation and performance characteristics of a wifi-enabled,
   MOSFET-based pulser design that uses a lithium-polymer battery and does
   not require high voltage isolation transformers. Currently, each output
   of this circuit follows a TTL signal with similar to 20 ns rise and fall
   times, pulses up to +/- 200 V, and is entirely isolated using fiber
   optics. Detailed schematics and source code are provided to enable
   continued use of robust pulsing electronics that ease experimental
   efforts for future comparison.}},

Abstract = {{Using a camera, a micro aerial vehicle (MAV) can perform visual-based
   navigation in periods or circumstances when GPS is not available, or
   when it is partially available. In this context, the monocular
   simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) methods represent an
   excellent alternative, due to several limitations regarding to the
   design of the platform, mobility and payload capacity that impose
   considerable restrictions on the available computational and sensing
   resources of the MAV. However, the use of monocular vision introduces
   some technical difficulties as the impossibility of directly recovering
   the metric scale of the world. In this work, a novel monocular SLAM
   system with application to MAVs is proposed. The sensory input is taken
   from a monocular downward facing camera, an ultrasonic range finder and
   a barometer. The proposed method is based on the theoretical findings
   obtained from an observability analysis. Experimental results with real
   data confirm those theoretical findings and show that the proposed
   method is capable of providing good results with low-cost hardware.}},

   an equivalent circuit that reproduces the worst-case performance of a
   harvester based on indoor PVSCs for a continuous illuminance range at
   room temperature. This methodology is validated using a commercial
   indoor PVSC that has been tested for several illuminance levels at a
   room temperature and warm white LED (light-emitting diode) spectrum. The
   extracted model achieves a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of
   4.85\% for the illuminance ranging from 177 to 33.3 x 10(3) lm/m(2).
   Furthermore, this model achieves a MAPE of 0.57\% at maximum power point

Abstract = {{The advent of easy-to-use open source microcontrollers, off-the-shelf
   electronics and customizable manufacturing technologies has facilitated
   the development of inexpensive scientific devices and laboratory
   equipment. In this study, we describe an imaging system that integrates
   low-cost and open-source hardware, software and genetic resources. The
   multi-fluorescence imaging system consists of readily available 470 nm
   LEDs, a Raspberry Pi camera and a set of filters made with low cost
   acrylics. This device allows imaging in scales ranging from single
   colonies to entire plates. We developed a set of genetic components
   (e.g. promoters, coding sequences, terminators) and vectors following
   the standard framework of Golden Gate, which allowed the fabrication of
   genetic constructs in a combinatorial, low cost and robust manner. In
   order to provide simultaneous imaging of multiple wavelength signals, we
   screened a series of long stokes shift fluorescent proteins that could
   be combined with cyan/green fluorescent proteins. We found CyOFP1,
   mBeRFP and sfGFP to be the most compatible set for 3-channel fluorescent
   imaging. We developed open source Python code to operate the hardware to
   run time-lapse experiments with automated control of illumination and
   camera and a Python module to analyze data and extract meaningful
   biological information. To demonstrate the potential application of this
   integral system, we tested its performance on a diverse range of imaging
   assays often used in disciplines such as microbial ecology, microbiology
   and synthetic biology. We also assessed its potential use in a high
   school environment to teach biology, hardware design, optics, and
   programming. Together, these results demonstrate the successful
   integration of open source hardware, software, genetic resources and
   customizable manufacturing to obtain a powerful, low cost and robust
   system for education, scientific research and bioengineering. All the
   resources developed here are available under open source licenses.}},

Abstract = {{Quality of life of disabled people in developed societies is one of the
   main issues to be achieved by evolution of technological solutions as
   well as obtaining low-cost equipment for achievement this purpose. Some
   equipment has been developed, and presented, and several studies have
   been performed about this subject. However, most of them present some
   gaps that are partially solved in this work. This paper describes a
   systematic approach and a final prototype for helping deaf people to
   feel music rhythm. The system hardware includes an audio sensor, two
   microcontrollers and light and vibrotactile outputs for transmitting the
   feeling of music rhythm. Also, a software interface has been developed.
   The prototype has been tested in several institutions that take care of
   deaf people. About 45 persons tested the equipment and the results
   achieved are encouraging. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   caused by the self-illumination effect can be identified without the

   commonly available in any laboratory, the accuracy of measurements is
   ensured. A capacitive load is used to bias the device due to its
   versatility and simplicity. The system includes a common part and an
   interchangeable part that must be designed depending on the electrical
   characteristics of each PV device. Control software, developed in
   LabVIEW, controls the equipment, performs automatic campaigns of
   measurements, and performs additional calculations in real time. These
   include different procedures to extrapolate the measurements to standard
   test conditions and methods to obtain the intrinsic parameters of the
   single diode model. A deep analysis of the uncertainty of measurement is
   also provided. Finally, the proposed system is validated by comparing

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{1. Quantitative measurements of above-ground vegetation biomass are
   vital to a range of ecological and natural resource management
   applications. Remote-sensing techniques, such as terrestrial laser
   scanning (TLS) and image-based point clouds, are potentially
   revolutionary techniques for measuring vegetation biomass and deriving
   other related, structural metrics for these purposes.
   2. Surface vegetation biomass (up to 25 cm) in pasture, forest, and
   woodland environments is estimated from a 3D point cloud derived from a
   small number of digital images. Volume is calculated, using the 3D cloud
   and regressed against dry weight to provide an estimate of biomass.
   Assessment of the method is made through comparison to 3D point clouds
   collected through TLS surveys.
   3. High correlation between destructively sampled biomass and vegetation
   volume derived from TLS and image-based point clouds in the pasture (TLS
   r(2) = 0.75, image based r(2) = 0.78), dry grassy forest (TLS r(2) =
   0.73, image based r(2) = 0.87) and lowland forest (TLS r(2) = 0.74,
   image based r(2) = 0.63) environments was found. Occlusion caused by
   standing vegetation in the woodland environment resulted in moderate
   correlation between TLS derived volume and biomass (r(2) = 0.50). The
   effects of surrounding vegetation on the image-based technique resulted
   in 3D point clouds being resolved for only 40\% of the samples in this
   environment.
   4. The results of this study demonstrate that image-based point cloud
   techniques are highly viable for the measurement of surface biomass. In
   contrast to TLS, volume and biomass data can be captured using low-cost
   equipment and relatively little expertise.}},

Abstract = {{The race to achieve smart cities is producing a continuous effort to
   adapt new developments and knowledge, for administrations and citizens.
   Information and Communications Technology are called on to be one of the
   key players to get these cities to use smart devices and sensors
   (Internet of Things) to know at every moment what is happening within
   the city, in order to make decisions that will improve the management of
   resources.
   The proliferation of these ``smart things{''} is producing significant
   deployment of networks in the city context. Most of these devices are
   proprietary solutions, which do not offer free access to the data they
   provide. Therefore, this prevents the interoperability and compatibility
   of these solutions in the current smart city developments.
   This paper presents how to embed an open sensorized platform for both
   hardware and software in the context of a smart city, more specifically
   in a university campus. For this integration, GlScience comes into play,
   where it offers different open standards that allow full control over
   ``smart things{''} as an agile and interoperable way to achieve this. To
   test our system, we have deployed a network of different sensorized
   platforms inside the university campus, in order to monitor
   environmental phenomena. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   system using Microcontroller}},
Journal = {{COGENT ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{OCT 20}},
Abstract = {{Power quality is a growing concern as the number of electric sensitive
   loads is increasing day by day in all fields. Poor power quality is
   badly affecting sensitive loads causing instability, malfunctioning,
   loss of data and great loss of economy. Thus, there is a need to improve
   power quality for which it is required to identify power quality
   problems occurring in the power system. This paper presents a low cost
   hardware to detect and classify most occurring power quality problems in
   the power system such as voltage sag, swell, interruption and unbalance
   using PIC microcontroller 18F452 for a 3-phase system. An algorithm is
   developed and the program is written into the microcontroller for
   classification. The program checks the conditions of the power quality
   problems based on the magnitudes of 3-phase voltages and classifies
   them. The system mainly consists of voltage sensing unit and
   microcontroller which senses 3-phase voltages, identifies the problem
   and gives output through LCD display, buzzer and LEDs showing type of
   power quality problem and p.u. voltage values. The circuit also trips
   load during power quality problems and connects it during normal
   conditions. The outputs of the hardware are given for various cases of
   the power quality problems.

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{OCT 19}},
Abstract = {{High-speed broadband services require optical fibres in access networks,
   in which multiple subscribers are connected to service providers, to
   satisfy the continuously growing bandwidth demand. The primitive
   signaling scheme used in access networks enables the use of low-cost
   equipment but diminishes the bandwidth available to end-users. Thus,
   current technology will be unable to support future broadband demands.
   Coherent communication systems offer significantly improved power-and
   bandwidth-efficiency, but require fundamental simplifications to become
   economically viable for access networks. Here, we demonstrate a
   promising simplified coherent receiver exhibiting a robust performance
   against polarisation fluctuations over an installed fibre network. It
   enables the realisation of high-order modulation formats and offers high
   sensitivities, achieving a four-fold increase in the supported number of
   subscribers and approximately doubling the transmission distance
   compared to the recently standardized access technology. The proposed
   solution indicates that digital coherent technology can be feasible and
   transform the access networks, enabling ubiquitous new services and
   applications with uncontended, multi-gigabits/user broadband

Title = {{Evaluation of the stability of lyophilized loop-mediated isothermal
   amplification reagents for the detection of Coxiella burnetii}},
Journal = {{HELIYON}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Coxiella burnetii, the causative pathogen for Q fever, is an obligate
   intracellular bacterium and designated as a biosafety level 3 agent.
   Detection and quantification of the bacteria with conventional culturing
   methods is time-consuming and poses significant health risks. Polymerase
   chain reaction (PCR)-based assays have been developed for detecting C.
   burnetii and could provide rapid diagnosis. However, they require
   specialized equipment, including a cold chain for PCR reagents that
   maintains their stability during storage and transport. These
   requirements limit the advantage of PCR-based methods, especially in
   resource-limited areas. Previously, we had developed a lyophilized
   loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay to detect the
   presence of C. burnetii. To simplify and improve this assay, the
   reagents for the LAMP assay and the detecting reagent, SYBR green, were
   lyophilized together. The stability of the lyophilized reagents was
   evaluated by measuring changes in detection limit for plasmid DNA
   encoding a C. burnetii gene upon storage at 4 degrees C, 25 degrees C,
   or 37 degrees C. Our data indicate that the lyophilized reagents remain
   stable for 24 months when stored at 4 degrees C, 28 days at 25 degrees
   C, and 2 days at 37 degrees C. This improved LAMP assay can be easily
   performed in a simple water bath or heating block. The stability at
   ambient temperature, the simplicity of assay procedure, and the
   availability of low cost equipment make this method ideal for use in
   resource-limited settings where Q fever is endemic.}},

   a control law that is based on the feedback linearization method and
   enhanced by an adaptive fuzzy algorithm to cope with modeling
   inaccuracies. The proposed depth controller is computationally light
   enough to run on ADAs embedded hardware. In experiments performed in a
   wave tank, the adaptive fuzzy scheme shows the ability to deal with both
   depth regulation and depth profile tracking. ADA is even able to hold on
   to dynamic isobars despite external disturbances. We demonstrate that
   under the influence of waves, ADA describes orbital motions similar to
   water particles.}},

Title = {{A force and thermal sensing skin for robots in human environments}},
Journal = {{ROBOTICS AND AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{1-14}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Working together, heated and unheated temperature sensors can recognize
   contact with different materials and contact with the human body. As
   such, distributing these sensors across a robot's body could be
   beneficial for operation in human environments. We present a stretchable
   fabric-based skin with force and thermal sensors that is suitable for
   covering areas of a robot's body, including curved surfaces. It also
   adds a layer of compliance that conforms to manipulated objects,
   improving thermal sensing. Our open hardware design addresses thermal
   sensing challenges, such as the time to heat the sensors, the efficiency
   of sensing, and the distribution of sensors across the skin. It
   incorporates small self-heated temperature sensors on the surface of the
   skin that directly make contact with objects, improving the sensors'
   response times. Our approach seeks to fully cover the robot's body with
   large force sensors, but treats temperature sensors as small, point-like
   sensors sparsely distributed across the skin. We present a mathematical
   model to help predict how many of these point-like temperature sensors
   should be used in order to increase the likelihood of them making
   contact with an object. To evaluate our design, we conducted tests in
   which a robot arm used a cylindrical end effector covered with skin to
   slide objects and press on objects made from four different materials.
   After assessing the safety of our design, we also had the robot make
   contact with the forearms and clothed shoulders of 10 human
   participants. With 2.0 s of contact, the actively-heated temperature
   sensors enabled binary classification accuracy over 90\% for the
   majority of material pairs. The system could more rapidly distinguish
   between materials with large differences in their thermal effusivities
   (e.g., 90\% accuracy for pine wood vs. aluminum with 0.5 s of contact).
   For discrimination between humans vs. the four materials, the skin's
   force and thermal sensing modalities achieved 93\% classification
   accuracy with 0.5 s of contact. Overall, our results suggest that our
   skin design could enable robots to recognize contact with distinct
   task-relevant materials and humans while performing manipulation tasks
   in human environments. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{GPS SOLUTIONS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1721-1733}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The widespread use of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver
   in mobile devices induces the adoption of effective GNSS-based indoor
   positioning algorithms exploiting low-cost hardware. In a previous
   study, we proposed a new architecture for indoor positioning system to
   estimate the user position by utilizing the pseudoranges from the
   smartphone-embedded GNSS module. The advantages of such a system are low
   cost and low requirements in terms of hardware-level modification for
   end users. However, all end users and most application developers do not
   have permission to read the pseudoranges from the embedded GNSS modules.
   Instead of pseudoranges, the user positions are easily obtained from the
   GNSS module in any mobile device. Thus, we further improve our
   positioning algorithm based on the position obtained from the embedded
   GNSS module rather than the pseudoranges. This position does not
   correspond to the true one since the indoor signal is non-line-of-sight.
   Thus, it is named the pseudo-position. The key to the improved algorithm
   is that the distances from the user terminal to the indoor transmitting
   antennas are calculated using the differences between the position of
   the outside antenna and the pseudo-position. The algorithm is tested
   using a simulated GNSS-based indoor positioning system which is
   implemented on a GNSS software receiver. The simulation results show
   that the indoor positioning system is able to provide horizontal
   positioning with meter-level accuracy in both static and dynamic
   situations. Additionally, the proposed method improves the robustness of
   the indoor positioning system to the non-synchronization measurements.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, the availability of low-cost equipment capable of
   recording kinematic data during walking has facilitated the outdoor
   assessment of gait parameters, thus overcoming the limitations of
   three-dimensional instrumented gait analysis (3D-GA). The aim of this
   study is twofold: firstly, to investigate whether a single sensor on the
   lower trunk could provide valid spatio-temporal parameters in level
   walking in normal-weight and obese adolescents compared to instrumented
   gait analysis (GA); secondly, to investigate whether the inertial sensor
   is capable of capturing the spatio-temporal features of obese adolescent
   gait. These were assessed in 10 obese and 8 non-obese adolescents using
   both a single inertial sensor on the lower trunk and an optoelectronic
   system. The parameters obtained were not statistically different in
   either normal-weight or obese participants between the two methods.
   Obese adolescents walked with longer stance and double support phase
   compared to normal-weight participants. The results showed that the
   inertial system is a valid means of evaluating spatio-temporal
   parameters in obese individuals.}},

Title = {{Substituting Sodium Hydrosulfite with Sodium Metabisulfite Improves

Abstract = {{Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a genetic blood disorder that is
   particularly lethal in early childhood. Universal newborn screening
   programs and subsequent early treatment are known to drastically reduce
   under-five SCA mortality. However, in resource-limited settings, cost
   and infrastructure constraints limit the effectiveness of
   laboratory-based SCA screening programs. To address this limitation our
   laboratory previously developed a low-cost, equipment-free,
   point-of-care, paper-based SCA test. Here, we improved the stability and
   performance of the test by replacing sodium hydrosulfite (HS), a key
   reducing agent in the hemoglobin solubility buffer which is not stable
   in aqueous solutions, with sodium metabisulfite (MS). The MS formulation
   of the test was compared to the HS formulation in a laboratory setting
   by inexperienced users (n = 3), to determine visual limit of detection
   (LOD), readout time, diagnostic accuracy, intra-and inter-observer
   agreement, and shelf life. The MS test was found to have a 10\% sickle
   hemoglobin LOD, 21-min readout time, 97.3\% sensitivity and 99.5\%
   specificity for SCA, almost perfect intra-and inter-observer agreement,
   at least 24 weeks of shelf stability at room temperature, and could be
   packaged into a self-contained, distributable test kits comprised of
   off-the-shelf disposable components and food-grade reagents with a total
   cost of only \$0.21 (USD).}},

Title = {{Open Source 3-D Printed Nutating Mixer}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{As the open source development of additive manufacturing has led to
   low-cost desktop three-dimensional (3-D) printing, a number of
   scientists throughout the world have begun to share digital designs of
   free and open source scientific hardware. Open source scientific
   hardware enables custom experimentation, laboratory control, rapid
   upgrading, transparent maintenance, and lower costs in general. To aid
   in this trend, this study describes the development, design, assembly,
   and operation of a 3-D printable open source desktop nutating mixer,
   which provides a fixed 20 degrees platform tilt angle for a gentle
   three-dimensional (gyrating) agitation of chemical or biological samples
   (e.g., DNA or blood samples) without foam formation. The custom
   components for the nutating mixer are designed using open source FreeCAD
   software to enable customization. All of the non-readily available
   components can be fabricated with a low-cost RepRap 3-D printer using an
   open source software tool chain from common thermoplastics. All of the
   designs are open sourced and can be configured to add more functionality
   to the equipment in the future. It is relatively easy to assemble and is
   accessible to both the science education of younger students as well as
   state-of-the-art research laboratories. Overall, the open source
   nutating mixer can be fabricated with US\$37 in parts, which is 1/10th
   of the cost of proprietary nutating mixers with similar capabilities.
   The open source nature of the device allow it to be easily repaired or
   upgraded with digital files, as well as to accommodate custom sample
   sizes and mixing velocities with minimal additional costs.}},

Title = {{Addressing isolation challenges of non-blocking caches for multicore

Journal = {{REAL-TIME SYSTEMS}},

Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{5, SI}},
Pages = {{673-708}},

Abstract = {{In multicore real-time systems, cache partitioning is commonly used to
   achieve isolation among different cores. We show, however, that space
   isolation achieved by cache partitioning does not necessarily guarantee
   predictable cache access timing in modern COTS multicore platforms,
   which use non-blocking caches. We find that special hardware registers
   in non-blocking caches, known as miss status holding registers, which
   track the status of outstanding cache-misses, can be a significant
   source of contention that is not addressed by conventional cache
   partitioning. We propose a hardware and system software (OS)
   collaborative approach to efficiently eliminate MSHR contention for
   multicore real-time systems. Our approach includes a low-cost hardware
   extension that enables dynamic control of per-core memory-level
   parallelism (MLP) by the OS. Using the hardware extension, the OS
   scheduler then globally controls each core's MLP in such a way that
   eliminates MSHR contention and maximizes overall throughput of the
   system. We implement the hardware extension in a cycle-accurate
   full-system simulator and the scheduler modification in Linux 3.14
   kernel. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the significance of
   the MSHR contention problem and the effectiveness of the proposed
   solution.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a data acquisition unit which synchronously samples
   multiple channels in a manner such that the time of day at which each
   sample is taken is known. This allows measurements taken at multiple
   locations to be compared with confidence. The intended application is
   wide area electrical power system measurements, in particular phasor
   measurement units (PMUs). The novelty of the authors' design is the
   application of an open hardware development platform to discipline a
   commodity analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to a broadcast time signal,
   usually but not exclusively GPS. The methodology used creates a driver
   layer for the ADC to achieve real-time sampling in a nonpreemptive Linux
   environment. The use of open hardware and software addresses the need
   for a transparent instrument for use in research and development of PMU
   technology. Through a choice of either a software or hardware
   phase-locked loop, the ADC is controlled to acquire exactly 256 samples
   per nominal power system cycle (i. e., 50/60 Hz), precisely time
   synchronized to GPS, at 16-b resolution and 94.2-dB SNR. The design of a
   printed circuit board expansion board featuring all necessary components
   is provided. The performance of the system is evaluated.
   Interoperability and data exchange with other systems is achieved by use
   of open schemas and communication protocols. This allows rapid
   integration with popular numerical simulation environments.}},

Title = {{Piloting a low-cost hardware intervention to reduce improper disposal of
   solid waste in communal toilets in low-income settlements in Dhaka,
   Bangladesh}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{AUG 29}},
Abstract = {{Background: Bangladesh faces daunting challenges in addressing the
   sanitation needs of its urban poor. Maintaining the cleanliness and
   functionality of communal toilets is dependent upon periodic emptying of
   fecal sludge, and cooperation between users of communal toilets. Trash
   disposal into latrines can block the outflow pipes, rendering the
   toilets non-functional.
   Methods: Pre-intervention: We conducted in-depth interviews with five
   operators of fecal sludge emptying equipment and five adult residents
   who were also caregivers of children. We identified factors contributing
   to improper disposal of trash into communal toilets, a barrier to
   operation of the equipment, in low-income communities of Dhaka,
   Bangladesh. Intervention design: We developed behavior change
   communication materials to discourage waste disposal in toilets, and
   promote use of waste bins. We conducted six focus group discussions with
   adult male, female, landlord and children to select the preferred design
   for waste bins to be placed inside toilets, and finalize communication
   materials. Post-intervention: We then pilot-tested an intervention
   package to promote appropriate trash disposal practices and thus
   facilitate periodic removal of fecal sludge when the latrine pits become
   full. We conducted 20 in-depth interviews and four focus group
   discussions with community residents, landlords and cleaners of communal
   toilets.
   Results: Barriers to appropriate waste disposal included lack of private
   location for disposal of menstrual hygiene products, limited options for
   formal trash collection and disposal, and the use of plastic bags for
   disposing children's feces. A pilot intervention including behavior
   change communication and trash bins was implemented in two urban slum
   communities. Spot checks confirmed that the bins were in place and used.
   Respondents described positive improvements in the appearance of the
   toilet and surrounding environment.
   Conclusion: The current practice on the part of local residents of
   disposing of waste into toilets impedes the safe removal of fecal sludge
   and impairs toilet functionality. Residents reported positive changes in
   toilet cleanliness and usability resulting from this intervention, and
   this both improves the user experience with toilets, and also promotes
   the sustainability of the entrepreneurial model of Vacutug operators
   supported by WSUP.}},

Abstract = {{In the era of the forth Industrial Revolution, open source code and open
   source hardware have gained much attention. In particular, 3D printing
   technology is expanding into the realms of classical science, technology
   and our daily lives. Relatedly, in the present study, we demonstrate the
   manufacture of a nano-LC MALDI spotter robot using 3D printing
   technology. The parts of the spotter robot were either made using a 3D
   printer or purchased as 3D printer parts from the 3D printer online
   market, so that anyone can make the robot without a deep knowledge of
   engineering or electronics, i.e., DIY (do-it-yourself) product. In the
   nano-LC MALDI spotter, the nano-LC eluent and MALDI matrix were mixed in
   a T-union and discharged from the capillary outlet. The eluent and
   matrix mixture could be spotted onto the movable MALDI plate. The MALDI
   plate was designed to translate in a two-dimensional space (xy plane),
   which was enabled by the movements of two stepper motors. In the paper,
   all computer-aided design (CAD) files for the parts and operation
   software are provided to help the reader manufacture their own spotter
   robot.}},

Abstract = {{Massive multiple-input-multiple-output full-duplex relaying (MM-FDR),
   which exploits both the benefits of large-scale antenna arrays and
   full-duplex transmission, is considered as a promising technology to
   achieve very high spectral efficiency in the future wireless network.
   Despite the inevitable presence of transceiver impairments due to the
   use of low-cost hardware components, most of the prior works on MM-FDR
   assume perfect transceiver hardware which is unrealistic in practice.
   This paper investigates the impact of hardware impairments on the
   MM-FDR. Based on the recent experimental results, the effect of hardware
   impairments is modeled using transmit and receive distortion noises. The
   end-to-end achievable rate is derived and the scaling behaviors of echo
   interference due to the full-duplex operation, multi-user interference
   and effective distortions caused by hardware impairments are obtained.
   The scaling results show that the achievable rate of MM-FDR is limited
   by the hardware impairments at the sources and destinations, instead of
   that at the relay or other interferences, as the number of relay antenna
   tends to infinity. A low-complexity power control scheme is proposed to
   further improve the energy efficiency of MM-FDR with hardware
   impairments. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can
   improve the spectral-energy efficiency tradeoff significantly.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Closed-loop experiments, in which causal interventions are
   conditioned on the state of the system under investigation, have become
   increasingly common in neuroscience. Such experiments can have a high
   degree of explanatory power, but they require a precise implementation
   that can be difficult to replicate across laboratories. We sought to
   overcome this limitation by building open-source software that makes it
   easier to develop and share algorithms for closed-loop control.
   Approach. We created the Open Ephys GUI, an opensource platform for
   multichannel electrophysiology experiments. In addition to the standard
   `open-loop' visualization and recording functionality, the GUI also
   includes modules for delivering feedback in response to events detected
   in the incoming data stream. Importantly, these modules can be built and
   shared as plugins, which makes it possible for users to extend the
   functionality of the GUI through a simple API, without having to
   understand the inner workings of the entire application. Main results.
   In combination with low-cost, open-source hardware for amplifying and
   digitizing neural signals, the GUI has been used for closedloop
   experiments that perturb the hippocampal theta rhythm in a
   phase-specific manner. Significance. The Open Ephys GUI is the first
   widely used application for multichannel electrophysiology that
   leverages a plugin-based workflow. We hope that it will lower the
   barrier to entry for electrophysiologists who wish to incorporate
   real-time feedback into their research.}},

Abstract = {{We describe the implementation of an OPT plate to perform optical
   projection tomography (OPT) on a commercial wide-field inverted
   microscope, using our open-source hardware and software. The OPT plate
   includes a tilt adjustment for alignment and a stepper motor for sample
   rotation as required by standard projection tomography. Depending on
   magnification requirements, three methods of performing OPT are detailed
   using this adaptor plate: a conventional direct OPT method requiring
   only the addition of a limiting aperture behind the objective lens; an
   external optical-relay method allowing conventional OPT to be performed
   at magnifications >4x; a remote focal scanning and region-of-interest
   method for improved spatial resolution OPT (up to similar to 1.6 mu m).
   All three methods use the microscope's existing incoherent light source
   (i.e. arc-lamp) and all of its inherent functionality is maintained for
   day-to-day use. OPT acquisitions are performed on in vivo zebrafish
   embryos to demonstrate the implementations' viability.}},

Abstract = {{Since 2001, the departments of Electrical and Electronics and

   Engineering, the University of Tokyo (UTokyo) have jointly given a
   lecture on autonomous electronic information devices for undergraduate
   students. According to the on-line questionnaire, 80\% of students in
   2010-2012 replied that the lecture was useful for their future career.
   The task given to students was to design and realise an autonomous
   electronic information devices (so-called the IoT-gadgets') by
   themselves, and conduct a live demonstration in front of their
   colleagues. The device must have an input', output', and some
   information processing'. Being aware of the speed of technology
   evolution as well as the short hours of the lecture, the professor tried
   not to give direct answers to students' questions on how-to instantly
   build and program an information device. Instead, the students were told
   to beware of their methods'. This refers to the deductive thinking
   introduced by Rene Descartes, and in the lecture's context how students
   should behave in order to realise the device. In this study, the
   backgrounds of various associated topics are discussed, such as the
   UTokyo's educational system, the world's rapid prototyping movement,
   open hardware, course design, students' reactions, and future

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{JUN 16}},
Abstract = {{In the past decades, bioassays and whole-organism bioassay have become
   important tools not only in compliance testing of industrial chemicals
   and plant protection products, but also in the monitoring of
   environmental quality. With few exceptions, such test systems are
   discontinuous. They require exposure of the biological test material in
   small units, such as multiwell plates, during prolonged incubation
   periods, and do not allow online read-outs. It is mostly due to these
   shortcomings that applications in continuous monitoring of, e.g.,
   drinking or surface water quality are largely missing. We propose the
   use of pipetting robots that can be used to automatically exchange
   samples in multiwell plates with fresh samples in a semi-static manner,
   as a potential solution to overcome these limitations. In this study, we
   developed a simple and low-cost, versatile pipetting robot constructed
   partly using open source hardware that has a small footprint and can be
   used for online monitoring of water quality by means of an automated
   whole-organism bioassay. We tested its precision in automated 2-fold
   dilution series and used it for exposure of zebrafish embryos (Danio
   rerio) a common model species in ecotoxicology to cadmium chloride and
   permethrin. We found that, compared to conventional static or

Abstract = {{While model predictive control (MPC) is the industrially preferred
   method for advanced control in the process industries, it has not found
   much use in consumer products and safety-critical embedded systems
   applications in industries such as automotive, aerospace, medical, and
   robotics. The main barriers are implementability and dependability,
   where important factors are implementation of advanced numerical
   optimization algorithms on resource-limited embedded computing platforms
   and the associated complexity of verification. This challenge comes from
   a requirement of the use of ultrareliable hardware and software
   architectures in safety-critical applications, low-cost hardware in
   consumer products, or both. This paper surveys the state-of-the-art in
   the emerging field of dependable embedded MPC, and discusses some key
   challenges related to its design, implementation, and verification. A
   novel result is the study of a simulator-based performance monitoring
   and control selection method that monitors and predicts MPC performance
   and switches to a highly reliable backup controller in cases when the
   MPC experiences performance issues.}},

   Aerial Vehicles to Monitor Concentrated Solar Power Plants}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2017}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Concentrated solar power (CSP) plants are increasingly gaining interest
   as a source of renewable energy. These plants face several technical
   problems and the inspection of components such as absorber tubes in
   parabolic trough concentrators (PTC), which are widely deployed, is
   necessary to guarantee plant efficiency. This article presents a system
   for real-time industrial inspection of CSP plants using low-cost,
   open-source components in conjunction with a thermographic sensor and an
   unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The system, available in open-source
   hardware and software, is designed to be employed independently of the
   type of device used for inspection (laptop, smartphone, tablet or
   smartglasses) and its operating system. Several UAV flight missions were
   programmed as follows: flight altitudes at 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 m
   above ground level; and three cruising speeds: 5, 7 and 10 m/s. These
   settings were chosen and analyzed in order to optimize inspection time.
   The results indicate that it is possible to perform inspections by an
   UAV in real time at CSP plants as a means of detecting anomalous
   absorber tubes and improving the effectiveness of methodologies
   currently being utilized. Moreover, aside from thermographic sensors,
   this contribution can be applied to other sensors and can be used in a
   broad range of applications where real-time georeferenced data
   visualization is necessary.}},

Abstract = {{A steady usage growth of various smart meters/sensors types comes along

   a proof-of-concept testbed using a cluster of low-cost and
   credit-card-sized single-board computers. We evaluated the proposed

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study secure multiple access based on multicarrier
   (MC) code division multiple access (CDMA) systems with induced random
   (chip) flipping of spreading sequence, which is suitable for
   machine-type communications (MTC). In MTC, devices may use low-cost
   hardware-based random number generators for pseudo-random noise (PN)
   sequences in secure communications. Since PN sequences can be estimated
   by correlation attacks at an eavesdropper, induced random (chip)
   flipping of spreading sequences is proposed to make correlation attacks
   infeasible. However, induced random flipping can also degrade the
   performance of detection and decoding at a legitimate receiver that only
   knows original spreading sequences. To avoid the performance
   degradation, we derive low-complexity iterative receiver algorithms for
   multiuser signal detection and decoding based on the
   expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{As low-cost desktop 3D printing is now dominated by free and open source
   self-replicating rapid prototype (RepRap) derivatives, there is an
   intense interest in extending the scope of potential applications to
   manufacturing. This study describes a manufacturing technology that
   enables a constrained set of polymer-metal composite components. This
   paper provides (1) free and open source hardware and (2) software for
   printing systems that achieves metal wire embedment into a polymer
   matrix 3D-printed part via a novel weaving and wrapping method using (3)
   OpenSCAD and parametric coding for customized g-code commands. Composite
   parts are evaluated from the technical viability of manufacturing and
   quality. The results show that utilizing a multi-polymer head system for
   multi-component manufacturing reduces manufacturing time and reduces the
   embodied energy of manufacturing. Finally, it is concluded that an open
   source software and hardware tool chain can provide low-cost industrial
   manufacturing of complex metal-polymer composite-based products.}},

Abstract = {{Memory stalls are a significant source of performance degradation in
   modern processors. Data prefetching is a widely adopted and well studied
   technique used to alleviate this problem. Prefetching can be performed
   by the hardware, or be initiated and controlled by software. Among
   software controlled prefetching we find a wide variety of schemes,
   including runtime-directed prefetching and more specifically
   runtime-directed block prefetching. This paper proposes a hybrid
   prefetching mechanism that integrates a software driven block prefetcher
   with existing hardware prefetching techniques. Our runtime-assisted
   software prefetcher brings large blocks of data on-chip with the support
   of a low cost hardware engine, and synergizes with existing hardware
   prefetchers that manage locality at a finer granularity. The runtime
   system that drives the prefetch engine dynamically selects which cache
   to prefetch to. Our evaluation on a set of scientific benchmarks obtains
   a maximum speed up of 32 and 10 \% on average compared to a baseline
   with hardware prefetching only. As a result, we also achieve a reduction
   of up to 18 and 3 \% on average in energy-to-solution.}},

Abstract = {{We are developing room temperature electronics based upon the ROACH
   platform to readout microwave multiplexed X-ray TES. ROACH is an
   open-source hardware and software platform featuring a large Xilinx
   Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), Power PC processor, several 10 GB
   Ethernet SFP+ interfaces, and a collection of daughter boards for analog
   signal generation and acquisition. The combination of a ROACH board,
   ADC/DAC conversion daughter boards, and hardware for RF mixing allows
   for the generation and capture of multiple RF tones for reading out
   microwave multiplexed X-ray TES microcalorimeters. The FPGA is used to
   generate multiple tones in base band, from 10 MHz to 250 MHz, which are
   subsequently mixed to RF in the multiple GHz range and sent through the
   microwave multiplexer. The tones are generated in theFPGAby storing a
   large lookup table in Quad Data Rate SRAM modules and playing out the
   waveform to a DAC board. Once the signal has been modulated to RF,
   passed through the microwave multiplexer, and has been modulated back to
   base band, the signal is digitized by an ADC board. The tones are
   modulated to 0 Hz by using a FPGA circuit consisting of a polyphase
   filter bank, several Xilinx FFT blocks, Xilinx CORDIC blocks (for
   converting to magnitude and phase), and special phase accumulator
   circuit for mixing to exactly 0 Hz. Upwards of 256 channels can be
   simultaneously captured and written into a bank of 256
   First-In-First-Out (FIFO) memories, with each FIFO corresponding to a
   channel. Individual channel data can be further processed in the FPGA
   before being streamed through a 10 GB Ethernet fiber-optic interface to
   a Linux system. The Linux system runs software written in Python and QT
   C++ for controlling the ROACH system, capturing data, and processing
   data.}},

Title = {{Openspritzer: an open hardware pressure ejection system for reliably
   delivering picolitre volumes}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAY 19}},
Abstract = {{The ability to reliably and precisely deliver picolitre volumes is an
   important component of biological research. Here we describe a
   high-performance, low-cost, open hardware pressure ejection system
   (Openspritzer), which can be constructed from off the shelf components.
   The device is capable of delivering minute doses of reagents to a wide
   range of biological and chemical systems. In this work, we characterise
   the performance of the device and compare it to a popular commercial
   system using twophoton fluorescence microscopy. We found that
   Openspritzer provides the same level of control over delivered reagent
   dose as the commercial system. Next, we demonstrate the utility of
   Openspritzer in a series of standard neurobiological applications.
   First, we used Openspritzer to deliver precise amounts of reagents to
   hippocampal neurons to elicit time-and dose-precise responses on
   neuronal voltage. Second, we used Openspritzer to deliver infectious
   viral and bacterial agents to living tissue. This included viral
   transfection of hippocampal interneurons with channelrhodopsin for the
   optogenetic manipulation of hippocampal circuitry with light. We
   anticipate that due to its high performance and low cost Openspritzer
   will be of interest to a broad range of researchers working in the life
   and physical sciences.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes and investigates a multilevel ac six-phase motor
   drive. The system is composed of five isolated three-leg voltage source
   inverters feeding the open-end windings of an asymmetrical six-phase
   induction motor (SPIM), which is adequate to generate multilevel
   voltages for high-power systems with voltage rating restrictions. A
   simple space vector pulse-width modulation (PWM) based on three similar
   individual planes and its implementation by means of equivalent
   level-shifted PWM are presented. A space vector pattern with a high
   number of voltage vectors redundancies is obtained. These redundancies
   and the application sequence of the voltage vectors are selected to
   minimize the amount of changes in the switching states and to decrease
   the harmonic distortion of the generated voltages. The vector pattern of
   this optimal modulation is obtained by analyzing only one plane and
   applied in the same way to the three planes as if they were independent.
   The developed PWM techniques have low computational complexity and are
   suitable for low-cost hardware implementations. Simulation results are
   used to compare the proposed topology with a conventional configuration
   in terms of harmonic distortion and semiconductor losses. Experimental
   results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed drive system.}},

   Completed With Standard Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery Equipment

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SURGICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{74}},

Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Training for the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS)
   skills test can be expensive. Previous work demonstrated that training
   on an ergonomically different, low-cost platform does not affect FLS
   skills test outcomes. This study compares the average training cost with
   standard FLS equipment and medical-grade consumables versus training on
   a lower cost platform with non medical-grade consumables.
   DESIGN: Subjects were prospectively randomized to either the standard
   FLS training platform (n = 19) with medical grade consumables (S-FLS),
   or the low-cost platform (n = 20) with training-grade products (LC-FLS).
   Both groups trained to proficiency using previously established mastery
   learning standards on the 5 FLS tasks. The fixed and consumable cost
   differences were compared.
   SETTING: Training occurred in a surgical simulation center.
   PARTICIPANTS: Laparoscopic novice medical student and resident physician
   health care professionals who had not completed the national FLS
   proficiency curriculum and who had performed less than 10 laparoscopic
   cases.
   RESULTS: The fixed cost of the platform was considerably higher in the
   S-FLS group (S-FLS, \$3360; LC-FLS, \$879), and the average consumable
   training cost was significantly higher for the S-FLS group (S-FLS,
   \$1384.52; LC-FLS, \$153.79; p < 0.001). The LC-FLS group had a
   statistically discernable cost reduction for each consumable (Gauze
   \$9.24 vs. \$0.39, p = 0.002; EndoLoop \$540.00 vs. \$40.60, p < 0.001;
   extracorporeal suture \$216.45 vs. \$25.20, p < 0.001; intracorporeal
   suture \$618.83 vs. \$87.60, p < 0.001). The annual fixed and consumable
   cost to train 5 residents is \$10,282.60 in the S-FLS group versus
   \$1647.95 in the LC-FLS group.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the average cost to train a single
   trainee to proficiency using a lower fixed cost platform and non
   medical-grade equipment results in significant financial savings. A
   5-resident program will save approximately \$8500 annually. Residency
   programs should consider adopting this strategy to reduce the cost of
   FLS training. (Published by Elsevier Inc on behalf of the Association of

   to mobile technology progressions, the future needs a sorting method
   that is available on any environment, such as not only high performance
   systems like servers but also low computational performance machines
   like embedded systems. In this paper, we present an FPGA-based sorting
   accelerator combining Sorting Network and Merge Sorter Tree, which is
   customizable by means of tuning design parameters. The proposed FPGA
   accelerator sorts data sent from a host PC via the PCIe bus, and sends
   back the fully sorted data sequence to it. We also present a detailed
   analytical model that accurately estimates the sorting performance. Due
   to these characteristics, designers can know how fast a developed
   sorting hardware is in advance and can implement the best one to fulfill
   the cost and performance constraints. Our experiments show that the
   proposed hardware achieves up to 19.5x sorting performance, compared
   with Intel Core i7-3770K operating at 3.50GHz, when sorting 256M 32-bits
   integer elements. However, this result is limited because of
   insufficient memory bandwidth. To overcome this problem, we propose a
   data compression mechanism and the experimental result shows that the
   sorting hardware with it achieves almost 90\% of the estimated
   performance, while the hardware without it does about 60\%. In order to
   allow every designer to easily and freely use this accelerator, the RTL
   source code is released as open-source hardware.}},

   The objective of the study is to present an assessment of increasingly

Abstract = {{We describe the use of a low-cost commercial flatbed scanner in the
   undergraduate teaching laboratory to image large (similar to 25 cm)
   interference and diffraction patterns in two dimensions. Such scanners
   usually have an 8-bit linear photosensor array that can scan large areas
   (similar to 28 cm x 22 cm) at very high spatial resolutions (similar to
   100 Megapixels), which makes them versatile large-format imaging
   devices. We describe how the scanner can be used to image interference
   and diffraction from rectangular single-slit, double-slit, and circular
   apertures. The experiments are very simple to setup and require no
   specialized components besides a small laser and a flatbed scanner. Due
   to the presence of Automatic Gain Control in the scanner, which we were
   not able to override, we were unable to get an excellent fit to the
   data. Interestingly, we found that the less-than-ideal data were
   actually pedagogically superior as it forced the students to think about
   the process of data acquisition in much greater detail instead of simply
   performing the experiment mechanically. (C) 2017 American Association of

Abstract = {{Traffic congestion is not only a cause of nuisance for general commuters
   but also a factor that has a measurable impact on the economy if not
   handled proactively. When congestion increases, the waiting time for
   commuters increases which results in wasted fuel and wasted time. Wasted
   fuel adds to the import bill of a country and lost time results in loss
   of productivity. Traffic can be regulated at various points in order to
   reduce congestion and eliminate bottleneck areas. In this paper, we
   propose the use of conventional scheduling to regulate traffic at
   intersections in order to reduce congestion. We propose minimum
   destination distance first (MDDF) and minimum average destination
   distance first (MADDF) algorithms and compare them with some of the
   relevant existing scheduling algorithms. The proposed algorithms can not
   only be easily implemented on low cost hardware but also show better
   performance and outperform the existing algorithms that are considered,
   based on simulation results. Simulation results show that the MDDF and
   MADDF algorithms reduce the traffic congestion at intersections by up to
   80\% in some cases compared to static traffic lights.}},

Abstract = {{A prototype of a variable temperature insert has been developed in-house
   as a cryogenic thermometer calibration facility. It was commissioned in
   fulfilment of the very stringent requirements of the temperature control
   of the cryogenic system. The calibration facility is designed for
   calibrating industrial cryogenic thermometers that include a temperature
   sensor and the wires heat-intercept in the 2.2 K-325 K temperature
   range. The isothermal section of the calibration block onto which the
   thermometers are mounted is weakly linked with the temperature control
   zone mounted with cooling capillary coil and cryogenic heater. The
   connecting wires of the thermometer are thermally anchored with the
   support of the temperature insert. The calibration procedure begins once
   the temperature of the support is stabilized. Homogeneity of the
   calibration block's temperature is established both by simulation and by
   cross-comparison of two calibrated sensors. The absolute uncertainty
   present in temperature measurement is calculated and found comparable
   with the measured uncertainty at different temperature points. Measured
   data is presented in comparison to the standard thermometers at fixed
   points and it is possible to infer that the absolute accuracy achieved
   is better than +/- 0.5\% of the reading in comparison to the fixed point
   temperature. The design and development of simpler, low cost equipment,
   and approach to analysis of the calibration results are discussed
   further in this paper, so that it can be easily devised by other

Abstract = {{We are surrounded by increasingly complex networks of smart objects, yet
   our understanding and attachment to them is rather limited. One way to
   support stronger end users' engagement with such complex technologies is
   by involving them in the design process and, with the advent of Arduino
   prototyping platform, even in their making. While DIY practice offers
   the potential for stronger user engagement with physical artifacts, we
   know little about end users' DIY practice of making complex electronic
   technologies and their potential to ensure engagement with such devices.
   In this article, we report on interviews with 18 participants from two
   green communities who built and used an open source DIY energy monitor,
   with the aim to explore the end users DIY practices of making such
   complex electronic devices. Findings indicate four key qualities of DIY
   monitors: transparent modularity, open-endedness, heirloom, and
   disruptiveness, and how they contribute to more meaningful engagement
   with the DIY monitors, elevating them from the status of unremarkable
   objects to that of things. We conclude with three implications for
   design for supporting end user development of complex electronic DIY:
   designing transparent open hardware technologies, standardizing
   communication protocols for the current and future DIY of IoT, and
   deliberately calling for personal investment and labor in the assembling
   of DIY kits.}},

Abstract = {{Implantable neuronal interfaces to the brain are an important keystone
   for future medical applications. However, entering this field of
   research is difficult since such an implant requires components from
   many different areas of technology. Since the complete avoidance of
   wires is important due to the risk of infections and other long-term
   problems, means for wirelessly transmitting data and energy are a
   necessity which adds to the requirements. In recent literature, many
   high-tech components for such implants are presented with remarkable
   properties. However, these components are typically not freely available
   for such a system. Every group needs to re-develop their own solution.
   This raises the question if it is possible to create a reusable design
   for an implant and its external base-station, such that it allows other
   groups to use it as a starting point. In this article, we try to answer
   this question by presenting a design based exclusively on commercial
   off-the-shelf components and studying the properties of the resulting
   system. Following this idea, we present a fully wireless neuronal
   implant for simultaneously measuring electrocorticography signals at 128
   locations from the surface of the brain. All design files are available

   Structured Light}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Depth information has been used in many fields because of its low cost
   and easy availability, since the Microsoft Kinect was released. However,
   the Kinect and Kinect-like RGB-D sensors show limited performance in
   certain applications and place high demands on accuracy and robustness
   of depth information. In this paper, we propose a depth sensing system
   that contains a laser projector similar to that used in the Kinect, and
   two infrared cameras located on both sides of the laser projector, to
   obtain higher spatial resolution depth information. We apply the
   block-matching algorithm to estimate the disparity. To improve the
   spatial resolution, we reduce the size of matching blocks, but smaller
   matching blocks generate lower matching precision. To address this
   problem, we combine two matching modes (binocular mode and monocular
   mode) in the disparity estimation process. Experimental results show
   that our method can obtain higher spatial resolution depth without loss
   of the quality of the range image, compared with the Kinect.
   Furthermore, our algorithm is implemented on a low-cost hardware
   platform, and the system can support the resolution of 1280 x 960, and
   up to a speed of 60 frames per second, for depth image sequences.}},

Abstract = {{Security against hardware Trojan that is capable to change the
   computational output value is accomplished by employing dual modular
   redundant (DMR) schedule during high level synthesis (HLS). However,
   building a DMR for Trojan security is nontrivial and incurs extra delay
   and hardware. This paper proposes a novel HLS methodology for constraint
   driven low cost hardware Trojan secured DMR schedule design for
   loop-based control data flow graphs (CDFGs). Proposed approach
   simultaneously explores an optimal schedule and optimal loop unrolling
   factor (U) combination for a low cost Trojan security aware DMR
   schedule. As a specific example, proposed low cost Trojan secured HLS
   approach relies on particle swarm optimization algorithm to explore
   optimized Trojan secured schedule with optimal unrolling that provides
   security against specific Trojan (causing change in computational
   output) within user provided area and delay constraints. The novel
   contributions of this paper are, first an exploration of a low cost
   Trojan security aware HLS solution for loop-based CDFGs; second,
   proposed encoding scheme for representing design solution comprising
   candidate schedule resources, candidate loop unrolling factor and
   candidate vendor allocation information; third, a process for exploring
   the a low cost vendor assignment that provides Trojan security; finally,
   experimental results over the standard benchmark that indicates an
   average reduction in final cost of similar to 12\% compared to recent
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{For land vehicle navigation in urban area, Global Positioning System
   (GPS) receivers often suffer from the lack of positioning accuracy,
   availability, and continuity due to insufficient number of visible
   satellites and multipath errors. To mitigate this problem, this paper
   proposes an efficient hybrid positioning method combining a single
   frequency GPS receiver and a monocular vision sensor. The proposed
   method is advantageous in that it requires only low-cost hardware and no
   external map aiding. Compared with existing vision-based methods, the
   proposed method directly measures absolute heading angle based on the
   images of straight road segments. For the reason, the proposed method is
   resilient to multipath errors. The performance of the proposed method is
   evaluated by the experiments with field-collected real measurements; one
   with good satellite visibility and the others with poor satellite
   visibility. Comparison with existing positioning methods demonstrates
   the feasibility of the proposed method in urban area.}},

Volume = {{82}},

Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Wireless Sensor Networks are composed of small autonomous devices known
   as motes. Usually these motes are power-limited and most energy is
   wasted through the communication process, thus the synchronization is
   critical. In this paper we improve the accuracy of time synchronization
   with Bayesian inference over the linear regression model used in
   synchronization protocols. Synchronization is generally accomplished
   using packet exchanges, so the goal is to reduce the number of packets
   while maintaining perfect synchronization. The constraints are the
   low-cost hardware components of the motes, in particular their docks and
   the power consumption. Long-term synchronization is achieved using
   Adaptive Time Window Linear Regression algorithms using Least Squares.
   The method of Least Squares is distribution free, but we can make some
   feasible assumptions (experimentally validated) to improve these
   protocols using Bayesian Inference to achieve an improvement of 12\%
   compared with the related work. In particular, using 80 MHz clock
   frequency in the motes the mean synchronization error is 147 ns. We
   propose an algorithm to improve the synchronization under these
   constraints and we test our method in real deployments.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet of Things, or the IoT, is an emerging, disruptive
   technology that enables physical devices to communicate across disparate
   networks. IP has been the de facto standard for seamless
   interconnectivity in the traditional Internet; and piggybacking on the
   success of IP, 6LoWPAN has been the first standardized technology to
   realize it for networks of resource-constrained devices. In the recent
   past Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) a.k.a Bluetooth Smart - a subset of the
   Bluetooth v4.0 and the latest v4.2 stack, has surfaced as an appealing
   alternative, with many competing advantages over available low-power
   communication technologies in the IoT space such as IEEE 802.15.4.
   However, BLE is a closed standard and lacks open hardware and firmware
   support, something that hinders innovation and development in this
   field. In this article, we aim to overcome some of the constraints in
   BLE's core building blocks by making three contributions: first, we
   present the design of a new open hardware platform for BLE; second, we
   provide a Contiki O.S. port for the new platform; and third, we identify
   research challenges and opportunities in 6LoWPAN-connected Bluetooth
   Smart. We believe that the knowledge and insights will facilitate IoT
   innovations based on this promising technology. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

   from multiple students in a classroom, and measured the inter-subject
   correlation (ISC) of activity evoked by a common video stimulus. The
   neural reliability, as quantified by ISC, has been linked to engagement
   and attentional modulation in earlier studies that used high-grade
   equipment in laboratory settings. Here we reproduce many of the results
   from these studies using portable low-cost equipment, focusing on the
   robustness of using ISC for subjects experiencing naturalistic stimuli.
   The present data shows that stimulus-evoked neural responses, known to
   be modulated by attention, can be tracked for groups of students with
   synchronized EEG acquisition. This is a step towards real-time inference
   of engagement in the classroom.}},

Title = {{Sense and Avoid Airborne Radar Implementations on a Low-Cost Weather

Abstract = {{Traditionally, multi-mission applications in airborne radar are
   implemented through very expensive phased array architectures. The
   emerging applications from civilian surveillance, on the other hand,
   prefer low-cost and low-SWaP (space, weight and power) systems. This
   study introduces a software-based solution that intends to use low-cost
   hardware and advanced algorithms/processing backend to meet the remote
   sensing goals for multi-mission applications. The low-cost airborne
   radar platform from Garmin International is used as a representative
   example of the system platform. The focus of this study is the optimal
   operating mode, data quality and algorithm development in cases of
   all-weather sense and avoid (SAA) applications. The main challenges for
   the solution are the resolution limitation due to the small aperture
   size, limitations from the field-of-view (FOV) and the scan speed from
   mechanical scanning. We show that the basic operational needs can be
   satisfied with software processing through various algorithms. The
   concept and progress of polarimetric airborne radar for dual-function
   operations at X-band Generation 1 (PARADOX1) based on the platform are
   also discussed.}},

   Airchive employs a relational database for storing data and implements
   two standards for sharing data (namely the Sensor Observation Service by
   the Open Geospatial Consortium and the Protocol for Metadata Harvesting
   by the Open Archives Initiative). The system is demonstrated in a
   realistic indoor air pollution data acquisition scenario in a four-month

Abstract = {{Designing and testing flight control algorithms for quadrotor UAVs
   (unmanned aerial vehicles) is not an easy task due to the risk of
   possible danger and damage during the practical flight. In order to
   improve the safety and efficiency of the flight control implementation,
   a low-cost real-time HILS (hardware-in-the-loop simulation) testbed for
   quadrotor UAVs is developed in this paper. To realize the HILS testbed,
   a miniature quadrotor is used as the main body, equipped with a micro
   AHRS (attitude heading reference system) unit and a self-build DSP
   (digital signal processor) board. The HILS is implemented by using xPC
   target. A compact PC/104 computer is utilized as the target computer,
   and a laptop PC is employed as the host computer. A desktop PC is used
   as flight visualization computer which runs FlightGear and Google Earth
   to show visual data, such as orientation and flight path of the
   quadrotor UAV. This testbed can be utilized for simulating various
   flight control algorithms, without losing safeness and reliableness. To
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed testbed, a new nonlinear
   adaptive sliding mode based stabilization control algorithm is developed
   and verified on the HILS testbed.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{A method for directly measuring carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions using a
   mobile sensor network in cities at fine spatial resolution was developed
   and tested. First, a com-pact, mobile system was built using an infrared
   gas analyzer combined with open-source hardware to control,
   georeference, and log measurements of CO2 mixing ratios on ve-hicles
   (car, bicycles). Second, two measurement campaigns, one in summer and
   one in winter (heating season) were carried out. Five mobile sensors
   were deployed within a 1x12.7 km transect across the city of Vancouver,
   BC, Canada. The sensors were operated for 3.5 h on pre-defined routes to
   map CO2 mixing ratios at street level, which were then averaged to 100 x
   100m grid cells. The averaged CO2 mixing ratios of all grids in the
   study area were 417.9 ppm in summer and 442.5 ppm in winter. In both
   campaigns, mixing ratios were highest in the grid cells of the downtown
   core and along arterial roads and lowest in parks and well vegetated
   residential areas. Third, an aerodynamic resistance approach to
   calculating emissions was used to derive CO2 emissions from the gridded
   CO2 mixing ratio mea-surements in conjunction with mixing ratios and
   fluxes collected from a 28 m tall eddycovariance tower located within
   the study area. These measured emissions showed a range of 12 to
   226CO(2) ha 1 h 1 in summer and of -14 to 163 kgCO(2) ha 1 h 1 in
   winter, with an average of 35.1 kgCO(2) ha (-1) h (-1) (summer) and 25.9
   kgCO(2) ha 1 h 1 (winter). Fourth, an independent emissions inventory
   was developed for the study area using buildings energy simulations from
   a previous study and routinely available traffic counts. The emissions
   inventory for the same area averaged to 22.06 kgCO(2) ha (-1) h (-1)
   (summer) and 28.76 kgCO(2) ha (-1) h (-1) (winter) and was used to
   compare against the measured emissions from the mobile sensor network.
   The comparison on a grid-by-grid basis showed linearity between CO2
   mixing ratios and the emissions inventory (R (2) =53 in summer and R (2)
   = 47 in winter). Also, 87\% (summer) and 94\% (winter) of measured grid
   cells show a difference within +/- 1 order of magnitude, and 49\%
   (summer) and 69\% (winter) show an error of less than a factor 2.
   Although associated with considerable errors at the individual grid cell
   level, the study demonstrates a promising method of using a network of
   mobile sensors and an aerody-namic resistance approach to rapidly map
   greenhouse gases at high spatial resolution across cities. The method
   could be improved by longer measurements and a refined calculation of
   the aerodynamic resistance.}},

   application-specific processor for such applications. In this work, we
   employ an efficient Strassen's algorithm for matrix multiplication and a
   highly efficient run-time-reconfigurable floating-point multiplier for
   matrix element multiplication. The run-time-reconfigurable
   floating-point multiplier is implemented with custom floating-point
   format for variable-precision applications. A very efficient combination
   of Karatsuba algorithm and Urdhva Tiryagbhyam algorithm is used to
   implement the binary multiplier. This design can effectively adjust the

Abstract = {{In this study, we introduce a modulation strategy for comprehensive
   two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC) by using a simple and
   consumable-free modulator. This ``Do-It-Yourself{''} interface comprised
   a 1.0 mx0.25 mm segment of MTX-5 metallic column and a low-cost DC power
   supply. Thermal desorption modulation (TDM) was attained using a
   dual-stage heater-based modulator in a novel segmented-loop
   configuration. TDM was achieved by alternating analyte trapping and
   thermal desorption. Former process relied on analyte partition to
   sorbent phase, while latter explored direct resistive heating.
   Introduction of an intermediate delay segment between the two stages
   mitigated analyte breakthrough, improving peak symmetry and
   chromatographic efficiency. This feature was critical to acquire
   reliable GCxGC modulation using such simple heater-based device. The
   effects of important modulation variables on 2D separations were
   investigated, including TDM stage length, dimension of delay loop, and
   outlet pressure. Significant advances and limitations of proposed TDM
   strategy were carefully determined. Proposed GCxGC prototype by using an
   in-oven TDM modulator was successfully applied to a series of
   challenging matrices, including petroleum distillates, biodiesel, and
   essential oil. This open-hardware, cost-effective modulator was easy to
   install and operate, as it circumvented the need for sophisticated
   components (e.g. moving parts and cooling systems). Therefore, our
   modulator is a compelling alternative to existing GCxGC solutions to
   operate in resource-limited laboratories.}},

Abstract = {{Direct-conversion radio transceivers can offer reprogrammable and
   low-cost hardware solutions for full-duplex (FD) cognitive radio
   networks (CRNs). However, they are susceptible to radio-frequency (RF)
   impairments, such as in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) imbalance (IQI),
   which can significantly limit spectrumsensing capabilities. This paper
   is devoted to quantifying and evaluating the effects of IQI in
   single-and multichannel energy detectors operating in FD mode under both
   cooperative and noncooperative spectrumsensing scenarios. In this
   context, closed-form expressions are derived for the false alarm and
   detection probabilities in the general case, where partial
   self-interference suppression (SIS) and joint transmitter (TX) and
   receiver (RX) IQI are considered. Furthermore, simplified closed-form
   expressions for the special cases, where either the RF front end is
   ideal or the SIS technique is perfect, are also presented. The presented
   analytical results have been verified through extensive simulations and
   indicate that the IQI and partial SIS can significantly affect
   spectrumsensing accuracy in FD-based CRNs. Specifically, if ideal RF
   front end is assumed, spectrum sensing error can significantly increase,
   leading to a reduction in the CRN performance and a negative effect on
   the performance of primary (PR) networks. Hence, when designing spectrum
   sharing algorithms for FD-based CRNs, the hardware impairments should be
   considered to improve the CRN performance while minimizing the negative
   effects on PR users.}},

Abstract = {{To keep the hardware costs of future communications systems manageable,
   the use of low-cost hardware components is desirable. This is
   particularly true for the emerging massive multiple-input
   multiple-output (MIMO) systems which equip base stations (BSs) with a
   large number of antenna elements. However, low-cost transceiver designs
   will further accentuate the hardware impairments, which are present in
   any practical communication system. In this paper, we investigate the
   impact of hardware impairments on the secrecy performance of downlink
   massive MIMO systems in the presence of a passive multiple-antenna
   eavesdropper. Thereby, for the BS and the legitimate users, the joint
   effects of multiplicative phase noise, additive distortion noise, and
   amplified receiver noise are taken into account, whereas the
   eavesdropper is assumed to employ ideal hardware. We derive a lower
   bound for the ergodic secrecy rate of a given user when matched filter
   data precoding and artificial noise (AN) transmission are employed at
   the BS. Based on the derived analytical expression, we investigate the
   impact of the various system parameters on the secrecy rate and optimize
   both the pilot sets used for uplink training and the AN precoding. Our
   analytical and simulation results reveal that: 1) the additive
   distortion noise at the BS may be beneficial for the secrecy
   performance, especially if the power assigned for AN emission is not
   sufficient; 2) all other hardware impairments have a negative impact on
   the secrecy performance; 3) despite their susceptibility to pilot
   interference in the presence of phase noise, so-called spatially
   orthogonal pilot sequences are preferable unless the phase noise is very
   strong; and 4) the proposed generalized null-space AN precoding method
   can efficiently mitigate the negative effects of phase noise.}},

Abstract = {{Three dimensional (3d) printer technologies are rapidly developing and
   increasingly being used in several fields. In this study, as a first
   step a 3d printer is constructed by modifying open source hardware and
   controlled by improving open source software. Subsequently, an ankle
   foot orthosis (AFO) is designed and constructed by using this 3d
   printer.
   The ankle foot orthosis, very important for human walking, is designed
   to control motion of the ankle and prevents deformities. An AFO can
   generally be used for following purposes: brace weak limbs, grasp ankle
   and foot in the right position and correct the foot drop. Since the
   users have different sizes of ankles and different types of deformities,
   an AFO must be produced to match in size to the end-user. Therefore
   off-the-shelf AFOs may not suitable for the each end user. Considering
   these factors, 3d printers are of great importance for producing
   individualized biomedical equipment. In this study, a distinctive ankle
   foot orthosis is first modelled by using CAD software and then produced
   by using constructed 3d printer. This AFO is the first ankle foot
   orthosis produced by a 3d printer in the literature of our country. This
   study is a proof that biomedical equipments can be produced in a shorter
   time and less costly by using 3d printers.}},

Abstract = {{Scientists have begun using self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap)
   3-D printers to manufacture open source digital designs of scientific
   equipment. This approach is refined here to develop a novel instrument
   capable of performing automated large-area four-point probe
   measurements. The designs for conversion of a RepRap 3-D printer to a
   2-D open source four-point probe (OS4PP) measurement device are detailed
   for the mechanical and electrical systems. Free and open source software
   and firmware are developed to operate the tool. The OS4PP was validated
   against a wide range of discrete resistors and indium tin oxide (ITO)
   samples of different thicknesses both pre- and post-annealing. The OS4PP
   was then compared to two commercial proprietary systems. Results of
   resistors from 10 to 1 M show errors of less than 1\% for the OS4PP. The
   3-D mapping of sheet resistance of ITO samples successfully demonstrated
   the automated capability to measure non-uniformities in large-area
   samples. The results indicate that all measured values are within the
   same order of magnitude when compared to two proprietary measurement
   systems. In conclusion, the OS4PP system, which costs less than 70\% of
   manual proprietary systems, is comparable electrically while offering
   automated 100 micron positional accuracy for measuring sheet resistance
   over larger areas.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes and assesses a decentralized solution based on a
   wireless sensor-actuator network to provide primary frequency control
   from demand response in power systems with high wind energy penetration
   and, subsequently, with relevant frequency excursions. The proposed
   system is able to modify the electrical power demand of a variety of
   thermostatically-controlled loads, maintaining minimum comfort levels
   and minimizing both infrastructure requirements and primary reserves
   from the supply side. This low-cost hardware solution avoids any
   additional wiring, extending the wireless sensor-actuator network
   technology towards small customers, which account for over a 30\% share
   of the current power demand. Frequency excursions are collected by each
   individual load controller, considering not only the magnitude of the
   frequency deviation, but also their evolution over time. Based on these
   time-frequency excursion characteristics, controllers are capable of
   modifying the power consumption of thermostatically-controlled loads by
   switching them off and on, thus contributing to primary frequency
   control in power systems with higher generation unit oscillations as a
   consequence of relevant wind power integration. Field tests have been
   carried out in a laboratory environment to assess the load controller
   performance, as well as to evaluate the electrical and thermal response
   of individual loads under frequency deviations. These frequency
   deviations are estimated from power systems with a high penetration of
   wind energy, which are more sensitive to frequency oscillations and
   where demand response can significantly contribute to mitigate these
   frequency excursions. The results, also included in the paper, evaluate
   the suitability of the proposed load controllers and their suitability
   to decrease frequency excursions from the demand side in a decentralized
   manner.}},

Abstract = {{The measurement of the relative phase of two sinusoidal electrical
   signals is a frequently encountered task in heterodyne interferometry,
   but also occurs in many other applications. Especially in
   interferometry, multi-radian detectors are often required, which track
   the temporal evolution of the phase difference and are able to register
   phase changes that exceed 2 pi. While a large variety of solutions to
   this problem is already known, we present an alternative approach, which
   pre-processes the signals with simple analog circuitry and digitizes two
   resulting voltages with an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), whose
   sampling frequency can be far below the frequency of the sinusoidal
   signals. Phase reconstruction is finally carried out by software. The
   main advantage of this approach is its simplicity, using only few
   low-cost hardware components and a standard 2-channel ADC with low
   performance requirements. We present an application on the two-color
   interferometer of the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak, where the relative phase of
   40 MHz sinusoids is measured.}},

Abstract = {{Graphics processing units (GPUs) are a powerful platform for building
   the high-speed network traffic processing applications using low-cost
   hardware. The existing systems tap the massively parallel architecture
   of GPUs to speed up certain computationally intensive tasks, such as
   cryptographic operations and pattern matching. However, they still
   suffer from significant overheads due to critical-path operations that
   are still being carried out on the CPU, and redundant inter-device data
   transfers. In this paper, we present GASPP, a programmable network
   traffic processing framework tailored to modern graphics processors.
   GASPP integrates optimized GPU-based implementations of a broad range of
   operations commonly used in the network traffic processing applications,
   including the first purely GPU-based implementation of network flow
   tracking and TCP stream reassembly. GASPP also employs novel mechanisms
   for tackling the control flow irregularities across SIMT threads, and
   for sharing the memory context between the network interfaces and the
   GPU. Our evaluation shows that GASPP can achieve multigigabit traffic
   forwarding rates even for complex and computationally intensive network
   operations, such as stateful traffic classification, intrusion
   detection, and packet encryption. Especially when consolidating multiple
   network applications on the same system, GASPP achieves up to 16.2x
   speedup compared with different monolithic GPU-based implementations of
   the same applications.}},

Abstract = {{Glial cells, also known as neuroglia or glia, are non-neuronal cells
   providing support and protection for neurons in the central nervous
   system (CNS). They also act as supportive cells in the brain. Among a
   variety of glial cells, the star-shaped glial cells, i.e., astrocytes,
   are the largest cell population in the brain. The important role of
   astrocyte such as neuronal synchronization, synaptic information
   regulation, feedback to neural activity and extracellular regulation
   make the astrocytes play a vital role in brain disease. This paper
   presents amodified complete neuron-astrocyte interaction model that is
   more suitable for efficient and large scale biological neural network
   realization on digital platforms. Simulation results show that the
   modified complete interaction model can reproduce biological-like
   behavior of the original neuron-astrocyte mechanism. The modified
   interaction model is investigated in terms of digital realization
   feasibility and cost targeting a low cost hardware implementation.
   Networking behavior of this interaction is investigated and compared
   between two cases: i)the neuron spiking mechanism without astrocyte
   effects, and ii) the effect of astrocyte in regulating the neurons
   behavior and synaptic transmission via controlling the LTP and LTD
   processes. Hardware implementation on FPGA shows that the modified model
   mimics the main mechanism of neuron-astrocyte communication with higher
   performance and considerably lower hardware overhead cost compared with
   the original interaction model.}},

Abstract = {{Computer science (CS) is becoming an increasingly diverse domain. This
   paper reports on an initiative designed to introduce underrepresented
   populations to computing using an eclectic, multifaceted approach. As
   part of a yearlong computing course, students engage in Maker
   activities, participatory simulations, and computing projects that
   foreground the social and collaborative aspects of CS. Collectively,
   these activities are designed to introduce learners to the growing
   diversity of what CS looks like in the 21st century. This paper lays out
   the practical and theoretical motivations for the Computational Thinking
   for Girls (CT4G) project, specifically highlighting the use of Making
   through physical and social computing as ways to engage students in CS.
   A snapshot of one activity from the program is provided-Wearing the
   Web-in which students use open-hardware programmable badges to explore
   the underlying structure and technology that enables the Internet. Data
   from the first year of the CT4G program are presented to show the
   positive effects that this diverse introduction to CS is having on the
   students with respect to their attitudes toward CS.}},

Abstract = {{A highly versatile Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) system,
   nicknamed the ScouseTom, has been developed. The systemallows control
   over current amplitude, frequency, number of electrodes, injection
   protocol and data processing. Current is injected using a Keithley 6221
   current source, and voltages are recordedwith a 24-bit
   EEGsystemwithminimumbandwidth of 3.2 kHz. Custom PCBs interface with a
   PC to control the measurement process, electrode addressing and
   triggering of external stimuli. The performance of the system was
   characterised using resistor phantoms to represent human scalp
   recordings, with an SNR of 77.5 dB, stable across a four hour recording
   and 20 Hz to 20 kHz. In studies of both haeomorrhage using scalp
   electrodes, and evoked activity using epicortical electrode mats in
   rats, it was possible to reconstruct images matching established
   literature at known areas of onset. Data collected using scalp electrode
   in humans matched known tissue impedance spectra and was stable over
   frequency. The experimental procedure is software controlled and is
   readily adaptable to new paradigms. Where possible, commercial or
   open-source components were used, to minimise the complexity in
   reproduction. The hardware designs and software for the system have been
   released under an open source licence, encouraging contributions and
   allowing for rapid replication.}},

Abstract = {{Drowsy driving is the primary cause of motor vehicle accidents and is a
   risk factor that leads to the loss of human life, remaining as a
   challenge for the global automotive industry. Recently, drowsy
   monitoring system has been actively studied for prediction system based
   machine learning. However, the challenges of automotive real-time
   constraints and flexibility should be taken into consideration against a
   large amount of heterogeneous data from vehicle network and other
   device. To solve this problem, we propose drowsy monitoring system based
   machine learning using GS1 standard. First, vehicle motion data is
   defined and modeled using the GS1 standard language for drowsy predict.
   Second, we propose an optimal algorithm selection and detail
   architecture for automotive real-time environments through machine
   learning algorithms (KNN, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression) and deep
   learning algorithms (RNN-LSTM). Finally, we describe system-wide
   integration and implementation through the open source hardware
   Raspberry Pi and the machine learning SW framework We provide optimal
   LSTM architecture and implementation that takes into account the
   real-time environmental conditions and how to improve the readability
   and usability of the vehicle motion data. We also share the rapid
   prototyping methodology case of connected car systems without other
   sensor devices.}},

Abstract = {{In the last decades the cost of manufacturing sensors has decreased
   greatly, making it possible to apply many different artificial
   intelligence techniques to improve the quality of our lives, one of them
   being the reduction of deaths in traffic accidents. Such misfortunes are
   usually caused by the long waiting period between the occurrence of the
   accident, the calling of the emergency service and their arrival. The
   goal of this work is to design an intelligent platform that detects a
   traffic accident automatically and which requires no interaction on the
   part of the people involved. We will design a low-cost hardware that
   will be suited to all types of vehicles. The sensors and medical
   services will be interconnected by a multi-agent system of virtual
   organizations (PANGEA).}},

Abstract = {{Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is associated with the sudden and
   unexpected death of a child under the age of one who is apparently
   healthy. This unforeseen death, in most cases has no explanation.
   Although its causes are not known with certainty, we do know of the
   risks that can trigger them. This work presents a network of sensors to
   monitor the main risk factors in this pathology, such as: temperature,
   humidity or the level of gases in the environment. A non-invasive system
   is proposed since the sensors are not in direct contact with the infant,
   unlike most monitoring systems available today. In particular, a virtual
   organization of agents has been developed, it is capable of integrating
   different sensors on an open and low cost hardware platform.}},

   Methods: Nanoprecipitation presents some advantages because it is a
   straightforward method with low-cost equipment that is easy to scale up.
   Results: However, there are two technical issues of concern related to
   this method. First, the two solvents used for this approach must be
   miscible; concomitantly, the drug has to be soluble enough in a solvent
   but not in the anti-solvent. Second, the particle growth needs to be
   adjusted by surfactant addition.
   Conclusion: In this review, nanoprecipitation methods and solvent
   removal techniques for poorly water soluble drugs will be discussed.}},

Title = {{Analysis of Closely Related Antioxidant Nutraceuticals Using the Green
   Analytical Methodology of ANN and Smart Spectrophotometric Methods}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AOAC INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{100}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Two new, simple, and specific green analytical methods are proposed:
   zero-crossing first-derivative and chemometric-based spectrophotometric
   artificial neural network (ANN). The proposed methods were used for the
   simultaneous estimation of two closely related antioxidant
   nutraceuticals, coenzyme Q10 (Q10) and vitamin E, in their mixtures and
   pharmaceutical preparations. The first method is based on the handling
   of spectrophotometric data with the first-derivative technique, in which
   both nutraceuticals were determined in ethanol, each at the zero
   crossing of the other. The amplitudes of the first-derivative spectra
   for Q10 and vitamin E were recorded at 285 and 235 nm respectively, and
   correlated with their concentrations. The linearity ranges of Q10 and
   vitamin E were 10-60 and 5.6-70 mu g.mL(-1), respectively. The second
   method, ANN, is a multivariate calibration method and it was developed
   and applied for the simultaneous determination of both analytes. A
   training set of 90 different synthetic mixtures containing Q10 and
   vitamin E in the ranges of 0-100 and 0-556 mu g.mL(-1), respectively,
   was prepared in ethanol. The absorption spectra of the training set were
   recorded in the spectral region of 230-300 nm. By relating the
   concentration sets (x-block) with their corresponding absorption data
   (y-block), gradient-descent back propagation ANN calibration could be
   computed. To validate the proposed network, a set of 45 synthetic
   mixtures of the two drugs was used. Both proposed methods were
   successfully applied for the assay of Q10 and vitamin E in their
   laboratory-prepared mixtures and in their pharmaceutical tablets with
   excellent recovery. These methods offer advantages over other methods
   because of low-cost equipment, time-saving measures, and environmentally
   friendly materials. In addition, no chemical separation prior to
   analysis was needed. The ANN method was superior to the derivative
   technique because ANN can determine both drugs under nonlinear
   experimental conditions. Consequently, ANN would be the method of choice
   in the routine analysis of Q10 and vitamin E tablets. No interference
   from common pharmaceutical additives was observed. Student's t-test and
   the F-test were used to compare the two methods. No significant
   difference was recorded.}},

Abstract = {{There are several specific solutions for accessing sensors and actuators
   present in any process or system through a TCP/IP network, either local
   or a wide area type like the Internet. The usage of sensors and
   actuators of different nature and diverse interfaces (SPI, I2C,
   analogue, etc.) makes access to them from a network in a homogeneous and
   secure way more complex. A framework, including both software and
   hardware resources, is necessary to simplify and unify networked access
   to these devices. In this paper, a set of open-source software tools,
   specifically designed to cover the different issues concerning the
   access to sensors and actuators, and two proposed low-cost hardware
   architectures to operate with the abovementioned software tools are
   presented. They allow integrated and easy access to local or remote
   sensors and actuators. The software tools, integrated in the free
   authoring tool Easy Java and Javascript Simulations (EJS) solve the
   interaction issues between the subsystem that integrates sensors and
   actuators into the network, called convergence subsystem in this paper,
   and the Human Machine Interface (HMI)-this one designed using the
   intuitive graphical system of EJS-located on the user's computer. The

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) problem.
   The main objective is to limit it by controlling the main reasons that
   may lead to it. Sudden infant death syndrome is the death without
   specific reason of a healthy newborn, usually during sleep. Although the
   causes are unknown, SIDS may be related to abnormalities in the infant's
   brain that controls breathing and arousal from sleep. Researchers have
   identified several measures that increase the risk on their babies.
   Thus, this paper proposes a low cost system that may help in monitoring
   the baby vital signs responsible for the SIDS and sending notifications
   to parents when abnormalities are encountered. The system is based on a
   microcontroller that regroups all sensors' outputs and a mobile
   application that displays these values, controls the video coming from a
   camera and send notifications in case of abnormal signals. The system
   was tested over 10 newborns (between 1 month and 2 years) over 3 weeks
   and the alarms were going well.}},

Abstract = {{Convolutional neural network (CNN) has achieved numerous breakthroughs
   in many artificial intelligent applications. However, its complexity is
   quite high and usually requires expensive GPU or FPGA implementation,
   which is not cost-effective for many embedded systems. In this paper, we
   develop a novel lapped CNN (LCNN) architecture that is suitable for
   resource-limited embedded systems. Our architecture follows the
   divide-and-conquer principle. The CNN is designed such that it can be
   decomposed into two or more stages, each can be implemented by a
   hardware module with a low-resolution input and very low complexity. The
   original input image is divided into some subimages of the same size,
   with properly designed overlaps with each other. These subimages are
   sequentially processed by the hardware module that implements the first
   stage of the CNN. The outputs from different subimages are then merged
   and processed by the next stage low-cost hardware CNN module. The result
   is exactly identical to that of applying a larger-scale CNN to the
   entire image with higher resolution. Therefore, by reusing low-cost
   hardware CNN modules, a low-cost and larger-scale CNN system can be
   achieved. The performance of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by
   experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{How can STS researchers collaborate with communities to design
   environmental monitoring devices that more effectively express their
   experiences and address gaps in regulation? This paper describes and
   shows the results of a novel method of visualizing environmental
   emissions of corrosive gases such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S) exposure
   using photographic paper. H2S is a neurotoxic and flammable gas that
   smells like rotten eggs and is frequently associated with oil and
   natural gas extraction. Communities living with oil and gas development
   in Wyoming report odors of rotten eggs and describe symptoms of H2S
   exposure. H2S is recognized as an acute and chronic threat to human and
   environmental health and oil and gas companies are required to have
   plans in place to prevent and respond to accidental, high concentration
   releases of H2S. They are not, however, required to monitor, report or
   prevent routine daily emissions. Yet 15-25\% of the oil and gas wells in
   the US are predicted to contain H2S, and some communities surrounded by
   multiple wells report chronic, routine exposure. Chronic exposure is
   difficult to represent with current tools for monitoring H2S because
   they are designed to measure acute workplace exposure. Informed by STS
   theories of black boxes and regimes of imperceptibility that focus on
   the need to revise not only regulations but also material tools of
   science, this paper describes the development of an indexical approach
   to visualizing this hazard. In indexical design, the reactive sensing
   element of a scientific instrument is brought to the foreground. The
   silver in the photopaper is an index as it tarnishes with H2S exposure.
   Discolored tests strips can be arranged together to form data-rich maps
   of the exposure landscape where this discoloration both represents how
   the gas spreads through a space and is a physical trace of the gas.
   Preliminary results in the form of data-rich maps show that regulating
   H2S emissions as primarily accidental is inappropriate and fails to
   adequately protect human health.}},

Abstract = {{Since 2000, the usage of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) in the military
   and civilian applications is increased rapidly. WSNs consist of low cost
   hardware which acts as multi-functional sensor nodes and are linked to
   the base station to efficiently aggregate and transmit the data.
   However, the limitation of sensor nodes is limited battery power.
   Efficient cluster head (CH) selection manages the WSNs in reducing the
   overall energy consumption. The cluster head combinations the data from
   the neighbouring nodes and transmits to the base station. The selection
   of cluster head in WSN is a Non-deterministic Polynomial-hard problem.
   In this paper, a bio inspired approach called firefly algorithm is used
   for selection of CH in WSNs. The synchronous firefly algorithm selects
   the optimal CH node among all nodes participated in the network, which
   also increases the performance of the network. The experimental results
   show that the proposed algorithm has effective CH selection procedure
   when compared to the other existing algorithms. The proposed algorithm
   reduced the packet loss ratio by 8.32\% and it improved the reduction of
   energy consumption of overall network.}},

   first part, the controller parameters are tuned to optimize two
   performance criteria in the detumbling and pointing modes in the
   presence of time-varying disturbing torques and disturbances, while in
   the second part, the controller parameters are optimized with respect to

Abstract = {{Robotics is one of the major disruptive technologies of our time, and
   offers significant opportunities for innovation and competitiveness in
   the global marketplace. However, in resource-poor countries like India,
   engineering education is hampered by a lack of access to affordable and
   innovative hands-on practical education modules for the laboratory. This
   is especially the case in emerging disciplines like robotics. Moreover,
   expensive commercial grade robots offer limited scope for
   experimentation and learning outcomes in an academic setting. This
   situation can be remedied with the increasing affordability and
   versatility of open source hardware like microcontrollers and
   microcomputers, commercial off-the-shelf components like motors,

Abstract = {{Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems can consume a
   large percentage of the energy used in a typical building. Intelligent
   building automation systems (BAS) are widely deployed to enable more
   efficient HVAC utilization, thus reducing the energy consumed. Enhanced
   data requires distributed sensing. We propose an instrumentation system
   for a low-cost, over-the-top efficiency monitor using the open-source
   hardware design to enable rapid deployment and live monitoring of
   temperature within zones such as rooms. This enables evaluation of HVAC
   system efficiency, and building parameter monitoring in that room. This
   paper presents our HVAC, thermal, and building parameter monitoring
   system design and considerations using an open-source hardware approach
   for fast customizations. We show results of monitoring two buildings
   including distributed sensing within rooms, and discuss intelligence
   gathered through use of this system as a precursor towards a fully
   automated efficiency evaluation and measurement.}},

Abstract = {{Soil and nutrient depletion from intensive use of land is a critical
   issue for food production. An understanding of whether the soil is
   adequately treated with appropriate crop management practices in
   real-time during production cycles could prevent soil erosion and the
   overuse of natural or artificial resources to keep the soil healthy and
   suitable for planting. Precision agriculture traditionally uses
   expensive techniques to monitor the health of soil and crops including
   images from satellites and airplanes. Recently there are several studies
   using drones and a multitude of sensors connected to farm machinery to
   observe and measure the health of soil and crops during planting and
   harvesting. This paper describes a real-time, in-situ agricultural
   internet of things (IoT) device designed to monitor the state of the
   soil and the environment. This device was designed to be compatible with
   open hardware and it is composed of temperature and humidity sensors
   (soil and environment), electrical conductivity of the soil and
   luminosity, Global Positioning System (GPS) and a ZigBee radio for data
   communication. The field trial involved soil testing and measurements of
   the local climate in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The measurements of soil
   temperature, humidity and conductivity are used to monitor soil
   conditions. The local climate data could be used to support decisions
   about irrigation and other activities related to crop health. On-going
   research includes methods to reduce the consumption of energy and
   increase the number of sensors. Future applications include the use of
   the IoT device to detect fire in crops, a common problem in sugar cane
   crops and the integration of the IoT device with irrigation management
   systems to improve water usage.}},

Abstract = {{Distributed manufacturing, where decentralized small, local sites are
   engaged in production, often supported by digital systems and networks,
   can be a powerful tool in humanitarian aid. Field Ready uses distributed
   manufacturing to produce essential non-food items locally where they are
   needed during humanitarian responses. Such supplies can be available to
   communities in need and to relief workers more quickly, more cheaply
   than alternatives, and provide appropriate solutions to problems, often
   engaging local people in designing and making necessary items, and
   supporting economic development. Scaling up this requires local
   production capabilities (skills, tools, and information such as
   designs), which can be boosted by adoption of these methods by aid
   agencies, international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) and
   others. Local manufacturing offers the potential for disaster affected
   communities to be engaged in recovery, and long term to become more
   resilient, with access to all the equipment and information required to
   make the supplies they need. However, there are challenges: appropriate
   quality control for distributed manufacture, unlocking the potential for
   in-region manufacturers to engage in humanitarian response, and uptake
   of digital knowledge sharing and collaboration to the humanitarian
   sector. In this paper, we share experiences of human-centred design and
   global collaboration to solve local problems, of manufacturing in remote
   and challenging locations, community building and bridging sectors
   through the Humanitarian Makers network, and new ideas for distributed
   manufacturing standards and quality.}},

   conventional plant factory which has already been widely used. The
   developed system collects environmental data by using soil sensor,
   illuminance sensor, humidity sensor and temperature sensor as well as
   control through smartphone app, analyzes the collected data, and
   controls water pump, LED lamp, air ventilation fan and so on. As a
   wireless remote control method, we implemented Bluetooth, Ethernet and

Abstract = {{The rapid development of new classes of nanomaterials calls for easy
   access methods in order to quantify properties essential for their
   functionality, e.g., interdiffusion of elements at interfaces, or
   elemental dopant, or depth profiles. Non-destructive methods, like X-ray
   fluorescence (XRF), are of special interest, for preserving materials
   and offering the possibility to incorporate the analysis in a production
   process. In-depth XRF methods for the characterization of nanomaterials
   are up until now limited to synchrotron radiation facilities. A novel
   scan-free grazing emission XRF (GEXRF) setup is presented utilizing
   conventional and low-cost hardware, acting as a transfer of a
   synchrotron method into the laboratory. A chromium target X-ray tube
   with a polycapillary lens is used as X-ray source and a conventional CCD
   as the 2D energy-dispersive detector. To confirm the feasibility of the
   described setup a nanometer-layered titanium-aluminium sample is
   measured. An energy-dispersive spectrum is obtained in
   single-photon-counting-mode from the CCD measurements and first GEXRF
   profiles generated. A semi-quantitative evaluation of this setup is
   implemented by comparing the measured results with simulations, allowing
   conclusions about the investigated samples' elemental, compositional,
   and structural layer-by-layer characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{The demand of the industry for high performance electric motors has
   significantly increased nowadays. This has boosted the usage of
   permanent magnet brushless synchronous motors (BLSM) in many
   applications where the accuracy and performance requirements are high.
   Further improvement of the BLSM drive systems performance can be
   achieved by providing them with adaptive control capabilities. The
   relative complexity of adaptive control schemes and algorithms and the
   computational load that they impose have prevented until recently their
   practical implementation into the industrial servo systems. In this
   investigation, a neuro-adaptive control scheme where the rule for
   parameter adaptation is designed by taking into account the variable
   structure control (VSC) concepts and Lyapunov stability, is proposed and
   embedded into an inexpensive, available on the market, position control
   system for brushless synchronous servomotors. The experimental tests
   have been carried on using compact and flexible, based on open hardware
   and software concept, dual-axis motion controllers PMC201/PMC202
   manufactured by the PicoMotion Inc. The applied software has been
   written using the Motion Control Framework software platform, provided
   together with the above controllers. The results obtained with the
   proposed neuro-adaptive control scheme have been compared to those
   obtained using the originally built into the system PI controller. The
   experiments have shown that the implemented advanced adaptive control
   approach is practically viable and can be embedded into the industrial
   motion control systems which will lead to their improved performance.}},

Abstract = {{In the last few years, a demand for renewed product personalisation to
   satisfy the exact need of the customers has been observed in some
   markets. As opposed to customisation, which put emphasis on the
   satisfaction of explicit needs of a defined market segment,
   individualisation aims at satisfying the specific needs of a customer.
   Product design for Mass Individualisation (MI) is a new product design
   paradigm that comprises an open hardware platform and multiple modules
   that are integrated with the platform, as per end-users' choice. This
   paper identifies key areas and components which need to be focused to
   realise this approach and convert it into an industrial practice by an
   explorative study of existing product design and customisation
   approaches. A questionnaire survey has been conducted and results are
   presented for the industrial implication and insights on this approach.
   The findings clearly show that MI provides most individualised and
   technologically advanced product.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with e-learning design and development training
   courses, more precisely with remote training by practical activities of
   laboratory experiments (E-Lab). Indeed. the majority of remote training
   platforms offer theoretical courses and a few practical activities.
   which are essential in training theoretical Science and Technology. In
   order to share the costly equipment, in this work, we propose an open
   hardware/software architecture allowing remote access to a laboratory
   equipment by designing in Matlab two graphical interfaces using
   Internet/Intranet network and TCP/IP communication protocol. A real-time
   control and supervision is performed to carry out all the practical
   activity according to a pedagogical scenario elaborated by the trainer.
   The use of these interfaces is illustrated by educational sessions
   articulated on the Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) regulation and
   the Generalized Predictive Control (GPC) of temperature control system.
   The challenge of elaborating a remote practical activity with
   pedagogical effectiveness is accomplished in the above proposed
   solution. All the hardware and software that made available the remote
   experimentation platform give possibility to achieve others traditional
   activities in experimentation laboratory.}},

Abstract = {{Modern homes are being crowded with electrical equipment, electronic
   entertainment devices and various home appliances. Consequently, power
   consumption and home electric bill has become a big burden on consumers.
   Accordingly, power rationalization through the use of smart devices can
   keep the consumer constantly aware and informed about the power
   consumption around the clock. Additionally, these devices can automate
   the power usage of home devices, thus converting modern homes to smart
   modern homes. Taking advantage of the evolving Internet of Things (IoT)
   and benefiting from the computational capabilities of the Amazon Web
   Services (AWS), we are proposing an open-source, low cost hardware and
   software solution that reduces power consumption, man power and
   maintains high level of security and scalability. The system was
   successfully tested at the Faculty of Information Technology labs at the
   University of Petra, Jordan. The system proved to work flawlessly and

Abstract = {{Meteorological information is important for decision making when related

   Considering that the cost of implementing monitoring stations can be
   high, studies have been carried out using low-cost equipment for
   meteorological monitoring. However, the information is unreliable
   because it does not follow a regulated standard and rises the
   uncertainty of how accurate the measurements are. This article studies
   the implementation of the Bosch BME280 integrated environmental unit
   which includes referential meteorological monitoring sensors for the
   estimation of temperature, relative humidity, and barometric pressure;
   used in mobile applications within the internet of things (IoT). The
   measurements produced by the Bosch unit are compared with those
   delivered by an automatic meteorological station (AWS) to determine the
   accuracy and reliability of the generated data. The outcomes show that
   the records present a constant phase shift, which, when determined and
   corrected, results in a similarity between measurements greater than
   95\%.}},

Abstract = {{Current Learning Management Systems (LMS) are able to use the data
   automatically captured from the actions of their users to provide
   immediate feedback to students and to provide a rich dataset to be mined
   or analyzed to understand and optimize the learning process. However, in
   traditional education, not all, or even the majority, of learning
   products are created or processed through the LMS. Traditional education
   still uses paper-based assignments and assessments as an integral part
   of the process. In these cases, the data contained in the LMS is often
   incomplete and do not provide a holistic view of the students'
   activities. To alleviate this problem, this work describes SARA, a
   system to automatically capture paper-based assignments and evaluations
   while the instructor is writing feedback and grading them. This
   information is uploaded automatically to the LMS to become part of both,
   the feedback provided to students and the data available for analyzing
   the learning process. This system is based on low-cost hardware and
   requires little configuration and intervention from the final user to
   work. An initial evaluation of the system provides evidence of the
   feasibility and usefulness of SARA in real-world learning environments.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a new methodology to analyze the effect of a marine
   outfall and its toxic waste on the surrounding submarine ecosystems,
   combining divers and a lightweight Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV)
   deployed and controlled from a small recreational boat. The innovation
   here is twofold: a) the relatively low cost equipment and human
   resources used in the overall process and the subsequent minimization of
   human risks, b) the application of all the technology that implies the
   use of an autonomous vehicle in this particular application, (automatic
   geo-localization, accurate mission programming and execution, increasing
   mission time or diverse sensorial data recollection). The process
   intends to go one step beyond the current methods employed to inspect
   marine industrial infrastructures, shipwrecks, geological or benthic
   zones of special interest, based on the participation of divers and, in
   some cases, Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs). The case study presented
   in this paper corresponds to the inspection of the sewage outfall in
   Palma de Mallorca, started after the detection of Cyanobacterium on the
   surrounding seafloor, a living organism which appearance indicates
   elevated concentration of nitrates and pollution in the water.}},

Abstract = {{Persistent deployment of underwater assets holds the key to achieve
   consistent, long-term undersea monitoring. To advance in that direction,
   the LOON-DOCK project aims to demonstrate remote AUV operation and
   survey data transmission through the Internet using an underwater
   docking station. We present a funnel-shaped docking station equipped
   with a contactless high bandwidth link and the necessary equipment to
   enable autonomous homing and docking by combining acoustic and optical
   sensing. The proposed combination, using a range-only localization at
   far distances and a light beacon localization at short ranges ensures a
   reliable strategy enabled with low-cost equipment and minimal
   requirements on both the vehicle and the dock sides. Moreover, remote
   operation is demonstrated by integrating the system in a unified web
   interface to control underwater assets, thus allowing a user to operate
   the AUV remotely through Internet. The full system has been successfully
   validated with tests conducted in a harbor environment.}},

   community around a new hardware platform. We examine the factors
   promoting the successful uptake of a maker platform from two
   perspectives: first, we investigate the technical and user experience
   considerations that users identify as the most important. Second, we
   explore the specific activities that help attract a community and
   encourage sustained participation. We present an inductive approach
   based on the case study of Bela, an embedded platform for creating
   interactive audio systems. The technical design and community building
   processes are detailed, culminating in a successful crowdfunding
   campaign. To further understand the community dynamics, the paper also
   presents an intensive three-day workshop with eight digital musical
   instrument designers. From observations and interviews, we reflect on
   the relationship between the platform and the community and offer
   suggestions for HCI researchers and practitioners interested in
   establishing their own maker communities.}},

Abstract = {{Because of the rapid development of EtherCAT as the standard fieldbus in
   control and automation and the increasing demands of low cost portable
   main controllers, we aim to assess the performance of an EtherCAT
   network in handling real-time demands using open source EtherCAT master
   protocol on open hardware platforms. In comparison to that of commercial
   products, the performance of open platforms is still indefinite and may
   depend on different indicators such as the kernel version, real-time
   architecture, and the protocol of EtherCAT. This paper provides
   implementation guidelines and procedures to develop the embedded
   platforms-a task which is difficult due to lack of systematic documents
   and technical support. The real-time evaluation of an open source
   EtherCAT master with a dual-kernel approach of real-time embedded Linux,
   Xenomai, is performed to validate that even low-cost open embedded
   hardware platforms are also capable in performing real-time EtherCAT

Abstract = {{In many resource/power constrained applications (e.g., in
   wireless-network nodes) there is a need for low cost hardware
   implementations of digital image watermarking techniques. However, to
   end up with such an implementation, a proper selection of a watermarking
   technique, based on performance and cost criteria, is not enough. For
   that reason, in this paper we introduce computation optimizations of the
   implemented algorithm to keep the integer portion of arithmetic
   operations at optimal size, and, hence, arithmetic units as small as
   possible. Additionally, the proposed architecture reutilizes those units
   in different computation steps, to further reduce implementation cost.
   The proposed design compares favorably with the already existing
   implementations, in terms of area, power and performance.}},

Abstract = {{Open source hardware projects are becoming more and more common.
   OpenRISC SOC, one of the prominent of these projects, has become quite
   popular with the support of volunteer developers. In this work, we have
   demonstrated the design of an DES (Data Encryption Standard) based
   system, that can be used in security applications, on ORPSoC-v2
   (Openrisc Reference Platform System-on-Chip). Additionally, we have
   showed that the system works successfully with a sample C application on
   an FPGA. This work emphasizes design security and flexibility features
   of open source systems against alternative closed source solutions.
   Another purpose of this study is to establish a platform for future
   studies on the analysis of side channel attacks.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a comparative study between advanced neural networks
   and fuzzy logic techniques for recognition of cylindrical, spherical and
   strength griping types of the hand, by means of the analysis of acquired
   surface signals using a SHIELD-EKG-EMG card. The main motivation of this
   article is to show which technique is more efficient for the recognition
   of the three types of grip due to the versatility of uses in the hand
   using low cost hardware. The training stage consisted on a total of 147
   training samples distributed in 49 training data for each type of study
   grip. In the experimental phase, 200 samples were acquired from a group
   of 10 participants and distributed in 10 samples in 2 sets of test for
   each type of grip. The results show that the difference in the
   recognition stage is not significant, so more advanced signal processing
   techniques will be put into effect in further studies to determine which
   technique is better.}},

Abstract = {{Particulate matter pollution becomes an increasingly important problem
   in developing countries and poses a hazard to human health especially in
   indoor environment. At the same time, modern buildings are equipped with
   advanced sensing and control technologies, offering control and
   optimisation capabilities over a large range of parameters. This paper
   proposes an open platform of a WiFi-enabled indoor air quality
   monitoring and control system, which could be incorporated into such a
   `smart building' structure. The complete software and hardware design of
   this system is presented, along with a series of control experiments.
   The proposed system operates over an existing WiFi wireless network
   utilising the MQTT protocol. It is capable of monitoring the indoor air
   quality as well as controlling an air purifier to regulate the
   particulate matters concentration. Experiment results under a real world
   office environment demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design.}},

Abstract = {{The majority of approaches for rotationally aligning panoramic images
   use feature-based methods which extract and match visual clues in both
   images and analytically determine their rotational offset. However,
   these methods can be computationally expensive and might suffer from
   motion blur or images taken in structureless environments (e.g.
   forests). An alternative approach is the visual compass, a method which
   simulates a wide range of possible rotational offsets and searches for
   the best match. While this approach has been successfully implemented
   for rotations around a single axis, the increasing computation time for
   3D rotations limits the usability for real-time applications. It has
   been suggested to use real spherical harmonics (RSH) to represent
   panoramic images, to calculate rotations in frequency domain using
   sparse matrix-vector multiplications. In this paper, we present
   strategies which are crucial to implement a real-time visual 3D compass
   using RSH. We provide a software implementation of the visual 3D compass
   and analyze the effect of increasing rotational misalignment between
   pairs of panoramic images. Furthermore, we show that the visual 3D
   compass can be used on low-cost hardware in real-time.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), so-called drones, have gotten
   a lot of attention in academic research and commercial applications due
   to their simple structure, ease of operations and low-cost hardware
   components. Flight controller, embedded electronic component, represents
   the core part of the drone. It aims at performing the main operations of
   the drone (e.g., autonomous control and navigation). There are various
   types of flight controllers and each of them has its own characteristics
   and features.
   This paper presents an extensive survey on the publicly available
   open-source flight controllers that can be used for academic research.
   The paper introduces the basics of UAV system with its components. The
   survey fully covers both hardware and software open-source flight
   controller platforms and compares their main features.}},

Abstract = {{Tangible learning is a promising branch, especially for scientific
   learning, allowing an enhanced sensorial involvement and participation
   by children. While a lot is being done on the side of programming, less
   has been investigated on elementary spatial and geometric concepts. The
   paper presents i-Vertex, an open -hardware framework for tangible
   serious games on geometry concepts for primary school pupils. The
   framework targets spatial reasoning and includes music as a related and
   complementary feature, which should add value also for usability.
   i-Vertex supports collaboration between kids and the key role of a
   teacher as an adult that interacts with the children in different ways,
   introducing them to the discovery and understanding of basic geometric
   concepts and physical phenomenon. At present, we have built a prototype,
   featuring a very limited number of vertices, and functionally tested it
   in lab, in two main scenarios covering topics such as lines and
   triangles. Based on the successful feedback of this experiment, we
   intend to proceed further, upgrading the platform with a more powerful
   and product oriented micro-controller and board.}},

Abstract = {{Since the demand for more bandwidth, agile infrastructures and services
   grows, it becomes challenging for Service Providers like GEANT to manage
   the proprietary underlay, while keeping costs low. In such a scenario,
   Software Defined Networking (SDN), open hardware and open source
   software prove to be key components to address those challenges. After
   one year of development, SDX-L2 and BoD, the SDN-ization of the GEANT
   Open and Bandwidth on Demand (BoD) services, have been brought to the
   pilot status and GEANT is now testing the outcomes on its operational
   network. In this demonstration, we show BoD and SDX-L2 ``going live{''}
   at the GEANT production infrastructure. The pilots run on the same
   underlay infrastructure thanks to the virtualization capabilities of the
   network devices. Provisioning of the services is covered during the
   demo. In the final steps of the demonstration, we show how the
   infrastructure is able to automatically manage network events and how it
   remains operational in the case of fault events.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, more and more organizations are aware of the increasing
   potential of nanoscience and nanotechnology, due to the wide field of
   innovative applications they address from biomedical and molecular
   technology to semiconductor and material sciences. Nanotechnology is an
   area where fundamental or applicative research is still in progress and
   where many industrial applications are waited to come. Despite the
   progress of this field, many institutions, notably educational ones,
   cannot afford investing in these technologies allowing an access to
   nanoscale, and a lack of knowledge therefore remains. The Nanoeye
   project focuses on the widespread of Atomic Force Microscopy or AFM
   technology, which is the basic access tool to the nanoscale. The main
   goal is to design an optimal AFM model in terms of manufacturing costs
   by using rapid prototyping techniques and open-source hardware, and
   designing it as an educational-oriented equipment. This approach is
   two-fold: as an AFM-unexperienced user discovering its principle of
   operation at nanoscale or as a future engineer understanding its
   multi-disciplinary structure involving mechanics, optics, electronics,
   software and control sciences. This paper introduces the first
   functional structure of Nanoeye AFM project, focusing on its mechanical
   structure. It is submitted to the IFAC2017 special feature Automatic
   Control Demonstrators. (C) 2017, IFAC (International Federation of

Abstract = {{This paper discusses about the trajectory planning and controlled
   maneuvering of the vehicle in parking assist mode. The objective of the
   proposed algorithm is to use low-cost hardware like ultrasonic sensor in
   order to provide automated parking assist to the vehicle. The concept of
   grid occupancy is formulated in free space detection algorithm to
   compute lateral-longitudinal grid cell vacancy. The vehicle will enable
   automated parking assist mode for controlled maneuvering on completion
   of free space detection followed by path planning. The reference planned
   path is an optimized trajectory with single maneuver for the vehicle to
   traverse in a free parking space. The localized trajectory and control
   algorithm of the perpendicular parking have been designed with reference
   to perception sensor input. The controller facilitates the intelligent
   navigation of vehicle based on measured obstacle free clearance distance
   and reference point. The steering control algorithm based on fuzzy logic
   is designed to provide an optimized maneuvering of the host vehicle in
   perpendicular parking space. In order to ease parking effort, an
   innovative approach of combined feedback and feed-forward based fuzzy
   controller has been illustrated. The controller performance has been
   evaluated in simulation environment keeping vehicle dynamics model in
   loop. The test scenario has been modeled in Carmaker to substantiate the
   optimization of route selection and a smooth transition of vehicle in
   parking assist mode during maneuvering into an empty parking space.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional outdoor positioning systems such as GPS, fails to locate
   indoor places and thus Indoor Positioning Systems (IPS) have a lot of
   importance. These systems are integral in providing Location Based
   Services (LBS) which can ease the daily life with useful information
   about one's current surroundings. Local network infrastructure such as
   Wi-Fi which is already available in places such as hospitals, shopping
   malls and educational institutions, can be used to locate a place in the
   indoor environment using the properties of the Wi-Fi signal. Hence we
   propose a model for indoor positioning system which implements a
   trilateration method using the amount of signal loss of at least three
   Access Points (AP) to find the position of a target. Also, we use
   techniques to stabilize the signal collection and compare the data with
   historical data to provide considerably accurate positional information.
   This system consists of very few components and the deployment criteria
   are comparatively simpler, so it can be easily deployed. Also, the use
   of low cost equipment such as Wi-Fi routers makes sure that the system
   is economically feasible.}},

Abstract = {{The chip industry faces two key challenges today the impending end of
   Moore's Law and the rising costs of chip design and verification
   (millions of dollars today). Heterogeneous IPs - cores and
   domain-specific accelerators - are a promising answer to the first
   challenge, enabling performance and energy benefits no longer provided
   by technology scaling. IP-reuse with plug-and-play designs can help with
   the second challenge, amortizing NRE costs tremendously. A key
   requirement in a heterogeneous IP-based plug-and-play SoC environment is
   an interconnection fabric to connect these IPs together. This fabric
   needs to be scalable - low latency, low energy and low area - and yet be
   flexible/parametrizable for use across designs. The key scalability
   challenge in any Network-on-Chip (NoC) today is that the latency
   increases proportional to the number of hops.
   In this work, we present a NoC generator called OpenSMART, which
   generates low-latency NoCs based on SMART(1). SMART is a recently
   proposed NoC microarchitecture that enables multi-hop on-chip traversals
   within a single cycle, removing the dependence of latency on hops. SMART
   leverages wire delay of the underlying repeated wires, and augments each
   router with the ability to request and setup bypass paths. OpenSMART
   takes SMART from a NoC optimization to a design methodology for SoCs,
   enabling users to generate verified RTL for a class of user-specified
   network configurations, such as network size, topology, routing
   algorithm, number of VCs/buffers, router pipeline stages, and so on.
   OpenSMART also provides the ability to generate any heterogeneous
   topology with low and high-radix routers and optimized single-stage
   pipelines, leveraging fast logic delays in technology nodes today.
   OpenSMART v1.0 comes with both Bluespec System Verilog and Chisel
   implementations, and this paper also presents a case study of our
   experiences with both languages. OpenSMART is available for download(2)
   and is going to be a key addition to the emerging open-source hardware
   movement, providing a glue for interconnecting existing and emerging
   IPs.}},

   This station, even though using low cost or handcrafted sensors, like
   those that measure wind speed, wind direction and rainfall index, showed
   consistent results costing only 10\% of the price, in comparison with
   some professional weather stations, allowing its popularization in

Abstract = {{Robotics has been used to draw the attention of young students to
   computing and engineering. Unfortunately, most hardware and software
   resources used to teach programming and robotics are not adequate for
   students with visual impairment (VI). For instance, most programming
   environments for young students are highly visual and the commercial
   robotics kits were not built for people with VI. This paper describes
   the main design requirements so that both the proposed robot hardware
   and the software can also be used by people with VI. The hardware part
   is the focus of this paper, a robot called Donnie. It consists of open
   hardware, a design with low-cost and easy to find parts, and a 3D
   printed structure. Our main contribution is the presentation of a
   low-cost Arduino-based robot, compatible with Player robotic framework
   and integrated with sound feedback and text-to-speech.}},

Abstract = {{An open hardware framework for approximating range and bearing of radio
   frequency (RF) sensors is presented. The current work has an immediate
   application in solving the simultaneous localization and mapping problem
   which is one of the challenging problems in the field of robotics. In
   this work, a set of RF sensors utilizing the ZigBee protocol are placed
   in an indoor environment and a base RF sensor is mounted within a
   rotating parabolic reflector on a mobile robot. The proposed range and
   bearing approximation framework works in two cascaded phases. In the
   first phase, the base RF sensor sends an RF signal to all other RF
   sensors within its operating range. These RF sensors then respond to the
   base RF module where ZigBee packets are parsed to store raw data for
   approximating range. In the second phase, a stepper motor is employed to
   rotate the parabolic reflector and the base RF sensor mounted on the
   robot. These two phases continue until a full revolution of 360 degrees
   has been achieved. The data is processed for approximating the bearing
   of each RF sensor with respect to the mobile robot's heading angle, as
   well as the distance (range) to the RF sensor at its associated bearing.
   The proposed hardware setup is validated through a set of experimental
   results gathered in an indoor environment.}},

Abstract = {{Open Source Hardware allows users to share, customize, and improve
   designs, thus enabling technological advancement through communities of
   practice. We propose open source hardware for educational haptics that
   permits researchers, educators, and students to share designs arising
   from their different perspectives, with the potential to expand
   educational applications. In this paper we present a family of open
   source kinesthetic haptic devices that build upon the design of a
   previous educational haptic device, Hapkit 3.0. First, we discuss
   methods for Hapkit personalization and customization that can be
   achieved by K-12 students and educators. Next, we describe two
   kinesthetic haptic device designs that evolved from the original Hapkit
   3.0. One uses two standard Hapkits with additional components to form a
   Pantograph mechanism, and the other uses customized Hapkit elements
   along with a novel kinematic design to form a serial mechanism. These
   designs are modular; after building two Hapkits, a user acquires a small
   number of additional parts to transform them into a
   two-degree-of-freedom device. The Pantograph mechanism was used in an
   undergraduate class to teach robotics and haptics to both engineering
   and non-engineering students. Open source designs for all devices as
   well as tutorials for customization are available at
   http://hapkit.stanford.edu.}},

Abstract = {{Urban electrical distribution networks are mostly comprised of Medium
   Voltage (MV) ring distribution feeders to improve reliability.
   Transformers connected to MV feeders transfer power from MV network to
   Low Voltage (LV) distribution networks. In underground LV distribution
   networks, feeder pillars are used to branch out LV feeders emerging from
   distribution transformers. Currently, the existing distribution systems
   have several issues that affect reliability and power quality. This
   paper proposes a low-cost distribution monitoring system developed using
   low-cost hardware and a MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, Node.js)
   software stack, which cater to requirements of Sri Lankan distribution
   utilities. Monitoring units that can be installed on LV feeder pillars
   are used to monitor LV electrical parameters and the condition of fuses
   of the feeder pillar. Data acquired from monitoring units are
   periodically transmitted to a remote TCP server using GPRS and then used
   to estimate power parameters of MV network, to detect faults, monitor
   trends and calculate system reliability parameters. The TCP server
   records all collected data in a database. A HTTP server is used to
   provide a user interface that can be used to view recorded data and
   processed information on a web-based interface.}},

Abstract = {{Meat is one of foodstuff that widely consumed in the world.
   Unfortunately, the quality of meat can easily degrade if not handled
   properly and become the serious health hazards if consumed. Hence, the
   food safety system is very important to guarantee the quality of food to
   be consumed. In this study, we introduced the development of mobile
   electronic nose for beef quality detection and monitoring. This system
   is developed using low-cost hardware and possible to integrate with
   cooling box or refrigerator for real time monitoring and analysis during
   distribution and storage processes. K-Nearest Neighbor with signal
   preprocessing is used to classify two, three, and four classes of beef.
   The experimental results show that the system can perfectly distinguish
   fresh and spoiled beef. Moreover, it has promising classification
   accuracy for binary, three classes, and four classes classification with
   93.64\%, 86.00\%, and 85.50\%, respectively. Hence, this system has a
   potential solution to provide low-cost, easy to use, and real-time meat
   quality monitoring system. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Although there are a large number of autonomous robot platforms for
   ground contact and flying robots, this has not been the case for
   underwater robotic platforms. This is not due to the lack of interesting
   applications in the shallow underwater domain (50m depth), but rather
   due to the relative cost of building such platforms. This has recently
   changed with the development of inexpensive thrusters and other
   underwater components. Leveraging these components and design principles
   learned from more expensive remotely operated vehicles this paper
   describes Milton, an inexpensive open hardware design for a traditional
   thruster-based underwater robot. Utilizing commercial off-the-shelf
   hardware and a ROS infrastructure, Milton, and Milton-inspired designs
   provide an inexpensive platform for autonomous underwater vehicle
   research.}},

Abstract = {{Software messaging frameworks help avoid errors and reduce engineering
   efforts in building distributed systems by (1) providing an interface
   definition language (IDL) to specify precisely the structure of the
   message (i.e., the message schema), and (2) automatically generating the
   serialization and deserialization functions that transform user data
   structures into binary data for sending across the network and vice
   versa. Similarly, a hardware-accelerated system, which consists of host
   software and multiple FPGAs, could also benefit from a messaging
   framework to handle messages both between software and FPGA and also
   between different FPGAs. The key challenge for a hardware messaging
   framework is that it must be able to support large messages with complex
   schema while meeting critical constraints such as clock frequency, area,
   and throughput.
   In this paper, we present HGum, a messaging framework for hardware
   accelerators that meets all the above requirements. HGum is able to
   generate high-performance and low-cost hardware logic by employing a
   novel design that algorithmically parses the message schema to perform
   serialization and deserialization. Our evaluation of HGum shows that it
   not only significantly reduces engineering efforts but also generates
   hardware with comparable quality to manual implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Smart Grids have nowadays gained wide diffusion and relevance. Due to
   the complexity of the grid, many Smart Grids laboratories have emerged
   over the years to provide partially virtualized environments for testing

   setting-up Smart Grids laboratories are substantial, representing a
   barrier for newcomers and for educational purposes. In this paper, we
   propose an hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) architectural solution based on
   Arduino and Raspberry PI boards, supported by the Mosaik framework to
   simulate different Smart Grids scenarios on a small and cost-effective
   scale. We highlight the educational benefits that the solution can bring
   for understanding simulations and HIL in an affordable \& effective way

Abstract = {{The concept of quality of life is used as a measure of the welfare of a
   society, highlighting the relationship between the environment and
   health, mainly associated with pollution. Hence the importance of
   monitoring and communicating its results, in a timely manner, to the
   community. But often the last part of the process fail, there is a lack
   of communication between data, information and community. Using open
   hardware and open source tools, and based on the Internet of things
   concept, a low-cost citizen monitoring network, that cost less than US
   \$150 was implemented. This network measures Carbon Monoxide (CO),
   Temperature, Relative Humidity, Particulate Matter 2.5, Noise and UV
   radiation, with a reading frequency of every 40 s and a hibernation
   period of 15 min. The environmental monitoring network gather
   information from the environment, through sensors, and then store it in
   a MySQL database, to finally be deployed in a web site hosted on a local
   web server Apache, implemented ex professo. In effect, the system is
   able to deliver geotagged information and the state of environmental
   pollution to the citizens.}},

Abstract = {{The primary objective of the paper is to construct and test a low-cost,
   minimally supervised gesture recognition system which identifies static
   gestures efficiently and accurately. The proposed system uses ADXL335
   accelerometer sensors which track the gestures and these sensors are
   interfaced with an Arduino ATMega 2560 micro-controller for data
   processing and gesture recognition. The software of the system
   implemented in the micro-controller, features a computationally feasible
   algorithm which requires only nominal resources to recognize the
   gestures. The paper further elucidates on minimizing the number of
   accelerometers to reduce the cost and power-consumption of the system.
   The performance of the system is assessed using static gestures in the
   alphabets of the American Sign Language (ASL) across data-sets obtained
   from 3 trained ASL signers. The average run-time efficiency of the
   proposed system with a maximum and minimum configuration of 5 and 2
   accelerometers was found to be 95.3\% and 87.0\%, with the cost of these
   prototype systems being realized at 20 USD and 12.5 USD respectively. It
   was also found that the system can be trained for the static gestures of
   the alphabets in ASL under two minutes by a new-user with any system
   configuration. The authors also feel that the system is compatible with
   other IoT platforms for interoperability.}},

Abstract = {{When learning different control related concepts and methods, simulation
   is often used as a training tool; but, it does not have some real time
   characteristics of implementation like dealing with coding and PC
   resources, supervision, and communications. In some cases,
   implementation cannot be carried away, since it involves hardware design
   and is expensive. The proposed solution in this paper involves low-cost
   Hardware-in-the-Loop for the Real Time Simulation of the plant or
   process to be controlled, a PC acting as a controller and a supervisor,
   and communications via Ethernet between the elements. It has the
   following advantages: new processes can be controlled by the PC without
   having to change the topology of the system; modifications on the plant
   or controller only require software changes; and has the potential of
   being extensible to a real system if the simulator software is changed
   to work as an Ethernet to analog decoder/ transducer.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between nurse and patient is vital as well as
   vulnerable on which a significant portion of wellbeing of patient
   depends. The recent growth of Internet of Things provides the
   opportunity to maintain this relationship in a more secure and efficient
   way. From this point of view, this paper presents a system of real-time
   nurse calling with focus centered on nurse feedback based on patient
   condition. The system also includes a robust archive monitoring system
   for review and trend analysis. In the proposed system, patients are able
   to call for assistance in time of emergency by pressing a designated
   button. After this, the device will send a real-time message containing
   information about the patients bed, room, and floor number to the
   appropriate nurse station. Nurse will respond as soon as the message is
   delivered, and optionally call for help by pressing designated buttons
   in the device. The proposed system reduces the delay in response of
   nurse. Additionally, the interactions are stored in Raspberry Pi
   database for future analysis to improve the quality of services. The
   proposed system uses low-cost hardware like ATMEGA328P microcontroller
   and ENC28J60 Ethernet controller, and Arduino Uno.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, the water crisis is not only visible in Brazil but almost
   everywhere and it arises where water scarcity becomes a global challenge
   or environmental concerns about the shortage of drinking water. The need
   to have water available for consumption is critical, since, in turn, it
   is the main source for life on Earth. Despite all of Earth's water
   found, only 2.5\% of it is freshwater. From this smallest part, 70\% of
   it is used in agriculture, 23\% by industries and 7\% for human
   consumption. This paper presents an embedded system prototype for air
   dehumidifying which has the main purpose of obtaining water (by means of
   condensation). Others benefits include low cost, low size, portability
   and an Internet of Things application approach. The dehumidifier uses an
   aluminum plate around 36 cm(2) and about 0.5 mm thickness, a
   thermoelectric Peltier tablet, a breadboard UNO R3 arduino, wires
   jumper, transistors TIP122 and 1 K Omega (Ohm) resistors. Within the
   initial results, we verified the condensed water in the aluminum and the
   formation of water repeatedly and controlled.}},

Abstract = {{In order to achieve unmanned aerial vehicle operation control ``human -

   engineering. However, due to the extreme lack of human data in the
   actual environment, GCS human reliability analysis and evaluation work
   is seriously limited. Thus, with the CGS human engineering evaluation
   background, this paper relies on low-cost hardware equipment Leap Motion
   to carry out human data capture technology. First of all, the
   feasibility of GCS manpower data acquisition on Leap Motion was proofed
   by analyzing the space adaptability, capture speed accuracy adaptability
   and secondary development ability etc. Then those key technologies
   including action capturing, action modeling and information processing
   were studied and specific work processes and application opportunities
   were discussed. From the final results, gestures and motions of virtual
   hands were same as real ones. The building processing speed was far from
   minimum demand of 15 frames per second. The accuracy and real-time
   performance of analysis demonstrated the movements accurately capture
   and data processing ability on the whole, which satisfied real time and

   and, then, frequency hopping the RF frequency. In this way, a low cost

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel approach based on pulse transit time (PTT)
   for the estimation of blood pressure (BP). In order to achieve this
   goal, a data acquisition hardware is designed for high-resolution
   sampling of phonocardiogram (PCG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG). These
   two signals can derive PTT values. Meanwhile, a force-sensing resistor
   (FSR) is placed under the cuff of the BP reference device to mark the
   moments of measurements accurately via recording instantaneous cuff
   pressure. For deriving the PTT-BP models, a calibration procedure
   including a supervised physical exercise is conducted for each
   individual. The proposed method is evaluated on 24 subjects. The final
   results prove that using PCG for PTT measurement alongside the proposed
   models, the BP can be estimated reliably. Since the use of PCG requires
   a minimal low-cost hardware, the proposed method enables ubiquitous BP
   estimation in portable healthcare devices.}},

   widen the number and type of possible hands-on experiments in control

   structure to control and monitoring PUMA560 motors. This approach
   combines several different technologies: A Raspberry Pi for control and
   monitoring, Python to control the system and chart data, as well as
   converters and drivers with serial I2C bus interface connectivity to
   read/write data from/to Puma560 robot. The ideas here explained could be

Abstract = {{Model predictive control applications have broadened from industrial
   plants with slow system dynamics to the implementation of control
   algorithms on low-cost hardware. Ip2go has been developed with the aim
   of making model predictive control readily accessible on embedded
   systems. It generates efficient, problem-tailored solvers for optimal
   control problems. The code generator implements Mehrotra's
   predictor-corrector interior-point method with Riccati recursions. It
   can be applied to quadratic programming problems with linear
   discrete-time system dynamics and polytopic inequality constraints. Both
   hard and soft constraints can be implemented. In this paper the features
   of ip2go, the underlying algorithm, the benefits of code generation and
   the generation process are set out. The comparison of ip2go-generated
   solvers to state-of-the-art solvers shows that ip2go can compete in
   terms of efficiency and code-size. The open and modular design allows
   all users to amend the generator. The Matlab (R) based and LGPL licensed
   C-code generator ip2go is available under

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of the development of a modular open
   source platform for experimental control setups. This platform emerged
   from research on the automatic rotation start-up and landing of a
   tethered airplane for wind energy harvesting, implementing and testing
   promising theoretical concepts such as real-time moving horizon
   estimation (MHE) and non-linear model predictive control (NMPC) on
   hardware developed in parallel. As experimental setups for testing new
   control algorithms tend to be fine-tuned by trial and error methods, a
   rapid control prototyping system for fast evaluation had to be
   implemented. Technical results of this research are presented in the
   form of a modular platform for real-time control.
   The created platform provides a complete toolchain for performing,
   observing and evaluating control experiments. It offers modular low-cost
   hardware and free software especially suited for flight control
   experiments. Clearly defined interfaces between the components allow for
   expanding on its current capabilities for other control scenarios in
   need of fast and reliable real-time control. The provided modularity
   allows for spatial separation of high performance computing hardware
   from low-level components, permits rapid reconfiguration of the
   experiment and eases the collaboration and workflow between hardware
   developers and control engineers. (C) 2017, IFAC (International

Abstract = {{Enabled by modern languages and retargetable compilers, software
   development is in a virtual ``Cambrian explosion{''} driven by a
   critical mass of powerfully parameterized libraries; but hardware
   development practices lag far behind. We hypothesize that existing
   hardware construction languages (HCLs) and novel hardware compiler
   frameworks (HCFs) can put hardware development on a similar evolutionary
   path by enabling new hardware libraries to be independent of underlying
   process technologies including FPGA mappings. We support this claim by
   (1) evaluating the degree with which Chisel, an existing HCL, can
   support powerfully parameterized libraries, and (2) introducing the
   concept and implementation of an HCF that uses an open-source hardware
   intermediate representation, FIRRTL (Flexible Intermediate
   Representation for RTL), to transform target-independent RTL into
   technology-specific RTL. Finally, we evaluate many hardware compiler
   transformations, including simplifying transformations, analyses,
   optimizations, instrumentations, and specializations, which demonstrate
   the power of a combined HCL and HCF approach.}},

Abstract = {{Following the successful adoption of the open source model in the
   software realm, open source is becoming a new design paradigm in
   hardware development. Open source models for tangible products are still
   in its infancy, and many studies are required to demonstrate its
   application to for-profit product development. It is an alluring
   question why entrepreneurs decide to use an open model to develop their
   products under risks and unknowns, such as infringement and community
   management. The goal of this paper is to investigate the motivations of
   entrepreneurs of open source hardware companies. The leaders and
   founders of twenty-three companies were interviewed to understand their
   motivation and experiences in creating a company based on open source
   hardware. Based on these interviews, we generated a hierarchical
   framework to explain these motivations, where each level of the
   framework has been defined, explained and illustrated with
   representative quotes. The motivations of open source action are framed
   by two categories in the paper: 1) Intrinsic Motivation, which describes
   the motivations of an entrepreneur as an individual, who needs personal
   satisfaction, enjoyment as well as altruism and reciprocity; 2)
   Extrinsic Motivation, which describes motivations of an entrepreneur
   whose identity is as a for-profit company leader.}},

   Urb@nEcoLife is a comprehensive proposal that develops a low-cost
   hardware platform together with a software architecture and a custom
   network topology. In addition, its main contribution is the introduction
   of crowdsourcing to get a really useful system for users by providing
   them with alerts, advises, reports and forecasts. Urb@nEcoLife is in its

   exhibits for their patrons. Academic libraries are often faced with the
   challenge of finding new inspirations to educate and engage patrons. The
   Illuminated Lifestyles exhibit at Binghamton University was an attempt
   to teach library users about the sensory experiences of medieval
   manuscripts using touch technology. Relatively inexpensive, these boards
   can be incorporated in various ways to make an exhibit interactive. In
   this case, the boards were used in conjunction with large-scale frames
   covered with digitized replicas of manuscript leaves that spoke to the
   viewer as they touched the images. This case study explains the
   technology and platforms used within the exhibit and what the long-term
   impacts and benefits, if any, the library experienced.}},

   Ground Vehicle (UGV) control is described. The hardware is based on CIAA
   (Computadora Industrial Abierta Argentina) and Arduino modules while the
   software is based on NuttX real-time operating system (RTOS). For
   communication, the MAVlink protocol is used, also enabling interfacing
   with ROS (Robot Operating System). The framework can be employed for
   different style UGVs (differential drive, omnidirectional, skid steer)
   with different number of motorized wheels. It is designed for low-cost
   and ease of integration and adoption. The proposed framework was
   employed as the control system of a four-wheel skid-steer rover protoype
   developed by the authors, which is also described as a part of this

Abstract = {{We demonstrate the feasibility of the realtime implementation of
   advanced binaural noise reduction algorithms in a single-chip computer
   called Raspberry Pi. The implementation of the considered algorithms is
   realized in Simulink, a graphical programming add-on to the integrated
   development environment Matlab. Using a complementary support pack- age
   for Simulink, the Raspberry Pi is connected/hosted. The implemented
   binaural noise reduction algorithm comprises two stages. First, the
   noise power spectral density (PSD) is estimated by one of the speech
   blocking-based noise PSD estimators previously proposed. The adaptively
   estimated noise PSD in each frame is then employed in a cue-preserving
   MMSE-based noise-reduction spectral gain function. The objective of this
   demonstration is to present the capabilities of the proposed algorithms
   with the application for hearing aids in a challenging noisy
   environment, i.e., congress babble noise in the show-and-tell area. The
   proposed solution suppresses the noise without having prior information
   on noise statistics, target speaker location and voice activity
   detection (VAD). Moreover, we would like to exhibit the powerful
   solution entirely executed with low-cost hardware.}},

Abstract = {{Precision aquaculture is a new tool developed in the field of
   information technology (IT) that allows the farmers having a better
   control of the farm processes, facilitate the decisions making, and
   improve the efficiency of the activity. The development of systems for
   continuous monitoring are important to aquaculture crops since these can
   detect unwanted conditions that can be harmful for organisms. In this
   study, are valued open hardware and artificial intelligence as
   alternative platforms to develop new monitoring systems. The proposed
   system automatically records the physicochemical variables of the water
   (dissolved oxygen, temperature and pH) and processes them using fuzzy
   logic (artificial intelligence) for the determination of the water
   quality index. The system was tested in a shrimp culture (Litopenaeus
   vannamei) with a size of 1.67 +/- 0.23g in a period of 84 days. The
   results show that the system analyzes the physicochemical variables most
   important of a shrimp culture and were able to qualify as a water
   quality index: poor, good and excellent according to the optimal
   thresholds required by the crop. This indicates that it is possible the
   use of the open hardware and fuzzy logic system for the monitoring of
   water quality index and its application in aquaculture.}},

Abstract = {{There is a growing trend within education establishments to teach
   electrical power system theory within lectures and back this up with
   software simulation laboratory sessions. This allows the courses to be
   taught at a lower cost than if real hardware was implemented. However,
   the students that are graduating from these programs are missing out on
   the opportunity to learn about real equipment and issues such as health
   and safety of voltages above 50V, mismatching component sizes and
   accuracy. Bespoke electrical power systems teaching equipment is
   expensive to buy. This paper details a low cost hardware setup that can
   be used to enforce electrical power system theory. The proposed
   equipment employs real off-the shelf equipment with some interfacing
   units which can be reproduced by laboratory technicians to enhance the
   student learning experience by offering students experience of real
   machines operating on an electrical power systems network.}},

   hardware and open source software in machining areas of Learning
   Factories. Based on the implementation of an optical object detection to
   discover human errors in the setup process of a milling machine, the
   paper presents an example of how value stream improvements in Learning
   Factories can be achieved by student projects.
   Therefore, the process of identifying possible solutions which are
   suitable for solving a problem in the value stream of a Learning Factory
   is described. In the presented case, this is an IT-solution to establish
   a Poka-Yoke system for depositing a work piece in a milling machine
   correctly. A solution, which uses a Raspberry Pi, is developed and
   integrated in the process. Furthermore, the ability of low cost hardware
   components and simple algorithms resting upon freely available software
   libraries to fulfil the requirements of modern manufacturing is
   demonstrated. Finally, this study illustrates that the implementation of
   in-house low cost digitalization rather rests on a profound
   understanding of the affected manufacturing process than on previous
   knowledge of programming or electronics. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published

   Unit (FMU). The controlled and control models are both simulated on
   Raspberry Pi minicomputers in real-time and one can observe the control
   strategy on the second Raspberry with prepared control task and Human
   Machine Interface (HMI). Both Raspberries are connected through the
   Modbus over TCP/IP protocol and one can get familiar with this wide-used
   communication. Furthermore, there is possibility to control the system,
   change regulators parameters and handle the trade-off between various
   performances. Regulation can be operated in so-called island or grid
   mode. The aim of system control is to comply shaft speed demands

Abstract = {{In order to effectively plan both preparedness and response to emergency
   situations it is necessary to access and analyse timely information on
   plausible scenarios of occurrence of ongoing events. Scenario maps
   representing the estimated susceptibility, hazard or risk of occurrence
   of an event on a territory are hardly generated real time. In fact the
   application of physical or statistical models using environmental
   parameters representing current dynamic conditions is time consuming on
   low cost hardware equipment. To cope with this practical issue we
   propose an off line generation of scenario maps under diversified
   environmental dynamic parameters, and a geo-Spatial Data Infrastructure
   (SDI) to allow people in charge of emergency preparedness and response
   activities to flexibly discover, retrieve, fuse and visualize the most
   plausible scenarios that may happen given some ongoing or forecasted
   dynamic conditions influencing the event. The novelty described in this
   chapter is related with both the ability to interpret flexible queries
   in order to retrieve risk scenario maps that are related to the current
   situation and to show the most plausible worst and best scenarios that
   may occur in each elementary area of the territory. Although, the SDI
   proposal has been conceived and designed to support the management of
   distinct natural and man-made risks, in the proof of concept prototypal
   implementation the scenarios maps target wild fire events.}},

Title = {{An Open Framework for Participatory PM2.5 Monitoring in Smart Cities}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Pages = {{14441-14454}},
Abstract = {{As the population in cities continues to increase rapidly, air pollution
   becomes a serious issue from public health to social economy. Among all
   pollutants, fine particulate matters (PM2.5) directly related to various
   serious health concerns, e.g., lung cancer, premature death, asthma, and
   cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. To enhance the quality of urban
   living, sensors are deployed to create smart cities. In this paper, we
   present a participatory urban sensing framework for PM2.5 monitoring
   with more than 2500 devices deployed in Taiwan and 29 other countries.
   It is one of the largest deployment project for PM2.5 monitor in the
   world as we know until May 2017. The key feature of the framework is its
   open system architecture, which is based on the principles of open
   hardware, open source software, and open data. To facilitate the
   deployment of the framework, we investigate the accuracy issue of
   low-cost particle sensors with a comprehensive set of comparison
   evaluations to identify the most reliable sensor. By working closely
   with government authorities, industry partners, and maker communities,
   we can construct an effective eco-system for participatory urban sensing
   of PM2.5 particles. Based on our deployment achievements to date, we
   provide a number of data services to improve environmental awareness,
   trigger on-demand responses, and assist future government policymaking.
   The proposed framework is highly scalable and sustainable with the
   potential to facilitate the Internet of Things, smart cities, and
   citizen science in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Infrastructure monitoring applications currently lack a cost-effective
   and reliable solution for supporting the last communication hop for
   low-power devices. The use of cellular infrastructure requires contracts
   and complex radios that are often too power hungry and cost prohibitive
   for sensing applications that require just a few bits of data each day.
   New low-power, sub-GHz, long-range radios are an ideal technology to
   help fill this communication void by providing access points that are
   able to cover multiple kilometers of urban space with thousands of
   end-point devices. These new Low-Power WideArea Networking (LPWAN)
   platforms provide a cost-effective and highly deployable option that
   could piggyback off of existing public and private wireless networks
   (WiFi, Cellular, etc). In this paper, we present OpenChirp, a prototype
   end-toend LPWAN architecture built using LoRa Wide-Area Network
   (LoRaWAN) with the goal of simplifying the design and deployment of
   Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices across wide areas like campuses and
   cities. We present a software architecture that exposes an application
   layer allowing users to register devices, describe transducer
   properties, transfer data and retrieve historical values. We define a
   service model on top of LoRaWAN that acts as a session layer to provide
   basic encoding and syntax to raw data streams. At the device-level, we
   introduce and benchmark an open-source hardware platform that uses
   Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) to help provision LoRa clients that can be
   extended with custom transducers. We evaluate the system in terms of
   end-node energy consumption, radio penetration into buildings as well as
   coverage provided by a network currently deployed at Carnegie Mellon
   University.}},

Abstract = {{Multicarrier modulation is one of the cornerstones of modern radio
   communications. Nowadays Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing
   (OFDM) finds wide employment in terrestrial mobile standards (WiMax and
   LTE) and also some significant applications in satellite communications.
   In order to improve OFDM efficiency and reduce the impact of nonlinear
   amplification, some variants of OFDM have been recently proposed; the
   most important are: Single-Carrier OFDM (SC-OFDM), known also as
   Discrete-Fourier Transform (DFT)-precoded OFDM recently proposed for
   Digital Video Broadcasting Next Generation broadcasting system to
   Handheld (DVB-NGH) standard, and the multi-user version of SC-OFDM,
   known as Single-Carrier Frequency-Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA),
   adopted by LTE for the uplink transmissions. In our paper, we aim at
   proposing a novel reconfigurable multicarrier transceiver implementation
   based on Software-Defined Radio (SDR), where OFDM and SC-OFDM TX/RX
   modes can coexist in the same device. The core module of the transceiver
   is based on the conventional OFDM, implemented in the digital domain by
   means of the N-point inverse Fast Fourier Transform (I-FFT).
   SC-OFDMprecoding, performed by means of a discrete Fourier transform
   (DFT) applied to a subset of M information symbols, is instantiated
   before I-FFT, when SC-OFDM mode is required. The SDR transceiver modules
   have been implemented by using open source GNU Radio tools and tested in
   open field by means of low cost hardware devices for RF transmission of
   software-generated basedband signals. Experimental trials have evidenced
   the viability of proposed SDR implementation, together with the
   recognized advantages that SC-OFDM offers in terms of improved link
   performance in hostile propagation environment. However, it has also
   been noticed that such improvement is obtained at the expense of a
   considerable increase of the computaional burden at the receiver side,
   if compared to that of regular OFDM.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid growth of a number of elderly people around the world, an
   increasing need has arisen in providing physical security to them.
   Researchers have been working in developing such monitoring systems for
   the past decades. However, the needs of elderly people and their
   families are yet to be fulfilled, especially since the developed
   existing systems need their users to change their lifestyles. This work
   aims at suggesting a system for monitoring the occupancy of an elderly
   person on the bed. Capacitive proximity sensing system has been proven
   to be a probable solution for indoor localization, which senses the
   presence of a human body. Nevertheless, the requirements for
   installation are many, which make the integration costly. In this paper,
   a flexible and integrated solution is proposed that makes use of
   inexpensive, open source hardware, allowing indoor localization and fall
   detection. The bed monitoring system is made up of aluminum sheets
   sensor electrodes installed under the bed sheets to detect the sleeping
   patterns of the subject. An alarm system has been integrated into the
   room to enable the elderly to call for help during an emergency.
   Presence detector and light controlling device are installed on the
   floor surface to detect the mobility of the elderly and turn ON/OFF the
   room lights automatically. The proposed system allows elderly people to
   live independent living at homes with all amenities.}},

Abstract = {{Vehicular ad-hoc Network (VANET) is an emerging mobile wireless ad hoc
   communication system applied on the roads, realizing multi-hop wireless
   communication between Vehicles to Vehicles, Vehicles to Roadside
   Infrastructure (RSI) and between RSIs. The Vehicle transmits the
   information to the nearest RSI that is connected to gateway either
   wirelessly or wired. The deployment of a roadside infrastructure is
   expensive and cannot be efficiently implemented using low-cost hardware.
   Power Line Communication (PLC) refers to the utilization of electricity
   transmission power lines for communication medium whilst simultaneously
   serving as a physical medium for realization of data transmission. PLC
   today are not only used for remote meter reading, home automation and
   other low-speed control systems but are also utilized at physical layer
   of Internet infrastructure. The power line is the only network that is
   available almost in any part of the inhabited area, hence can provide
   extensive coverage for VANET. In this article a scheme is proposed for
   power lines serve as a medium for transfer of information from RSI to
   RSI and RSI to Internet gateway. Standard equations are used to noise
   analysis and quantify the proposed approach as a cost effective
   deployment of PLC for VANET. Simulation results are provided for further
   investigations and research. It is evident that PLC with low data rate
   is suitable for transmission of smart car sensor data as compare to
   costly high-speed wireless medium.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the subject of embedded systems education in the Arduino
   age is examined. Arduino is an open-source microcontroller platform that
   has been widely popular in the past decade among hobbyists and
   academics. Arduino is increasingly being adopted in courses that span
   different disciplines in schools and universities. As a result, numerous
   papers are being published every year in different engineering education
   conferences and journals reporting the integration of Arduino in
   teaching. In this work, the impact of Arduino on embedded systems
   education is investigated. First, challenges facing embedded systems
   education are identified from the literature. Second, different Arduino
   teaching integration methodologies reported in the literature are
   surveyed and analyzed. Third, the question whether Arduino successfully
   addresses embedded education challenges or not is discussed taking both
   surveyed findings and recent market trends into consideration. Finally,
   a number of openended research directions are proposed.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT UNMANNED SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{28-42}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a method for a
   vision-based automatic landing of a multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle
   (UAV) on a moving platform. The landing system must be highly accurate
   and meet the size, weigh, and power restrictions of a small UAV.
   Design/methodology/approach - The vision-based landing system consists
   of a pattern of red markers placed on a moving target, an image
   processing algorithm for pattern detection, and a servo-control for
   tracking. The suggested approach uses a color-based object detection and
   image-based visual servoing.
   Findings - The developed prototype system has demonstrated the
   capability of landing within 25 cm of the desired point of touchdown.
   This auto-landing system is small (100 x 100 mm), light-weight (100 g),
   and consumes little power (under 2 W).
   Originality/value - The novelty and the main contribution of the
   suggested approach are a creative combination of work in two fields:
   image processing and controls as applied to the UAV landing. The
   developed image processing algorithm has low complexity as compared to
   other known methods, which allows its implementation on general-purpose
   low-cost hardware. The theoretical design has been verified
   systematically via simulations and then outdoors field tests.}},

Abstract = {{Microprocessor (uP) Architecture and Programming constitute core courses
   in computer science and electronic engineering departments. A variety of
   tools has been used for gaining more knowledge and understanding the
   basic and advanced concepts of the course. These tools (hardware
   platforms and simulators) are focused mainly on assembly programming.
   Despite the existing tools, students still face great learning
   difficulties. On the other hand, key issues are the corresponding
   architecture and the programming features of the uP under studying. The
   above issues are not fully addressed by the existing tools. In this
   paper, a customizable hardware based uP simulator is presented and final
   proposed. Using this simulator, an experimental hypothetical educational
   uP can be built by students and the professors can create the
   corresponding learning scenarios. Based on the proposed approach, the
   experimental uP consists of identical hardware based blocks that can be
   reprogrammed for representing registers, arithmetic and logic unit, etc.
   Thus, the students can act now as uP architecture and assembly language
   designers gaining crucial knowledge in the field.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, many internet of things (IoT) platforms based on cloud
   computing have been proposed for general purpose applications. Though
   many similar platforms or schemes particular for smart home applications
   have been proposed, many issues such as multiple connectivity due to
   diversity of smart home applications and supporting for real-time
   operations have not been solved properly. We propose a smart home
   foundation scheme adopting open source hardware devices and cloud
   computing technology to explore these issues. In this scheme, Arduino
   Yun-based smart hardware devices can connect to the cloud server through
   multiply network connectivity. By utilising Spacebrew technology, a
   bidirectional real-time communication can be implemented which provides
   a solid foundation for real-time operations of smart home. The core
   functions of the scheme are exposed through RESTful web services in a
   SaaS (short for software as a service) manner and can be called by
   various clients and other applications. Demonstrative applications show
   that the proposed smart home foundation scheme provides adequate support
   for creating smart home applications based on wireless open source
   hardware devices.}},

Abstract = {{Augmented Reality (AR) merges real and virtual objects in order to make
   a richer environment with additional useful virtual information.
   Producing AR maintenance training depends on two major points that will
   be Interactivity and Reusability.
   Recently Augmented Reality becomes the new technology revolution in
   software applications such as (entertainment, training, military,
   E-shops and games), and the new generation of hardware computers,
   mobiles, and consoles which can support the AR view. Always there is a
   limitation about user interactivity in using keyboard, mouse, and touch
   screens as input for virtual reality applications. Hand Gesture
   Recognition using depth cameras is an innovative solution to easily
   interact and manipulate virtual scene objects which are needed for
   computer users widely in entertainment or military applications. This
   research presents a solution for those areas and helps to design more
   realistic application with low cost and good efficiency. Using
   IntelRealSense (RS) Camera, which is a low cost hardware and very
   helpful as gesture and depth capture camera. Maintenance training was
   chosen as the case study for a reusable AR framework. This paper present
   a solution to two major problems: First, the calculation of occlusion
   between the real and the virtual objects including human hand. Second,
   problem will be to discuss object collision detection, to add more
   realism between the gesture recognition and the dynamic virtual scene.
   The proposed framework is designed to overcome or enhance the problems
   of developing augmented reality scenes that can be used to integrate
   between natural human activities and virtual world or real time computer
   graphics. So, maintenance training framework could make it possible for
   users to be trained, and helped with real-time instructions which can be
   followed to achieve the task goal without need to reference guide or
   separate catalog. The proposed framework succeeded in implementing
   maintenance training with gesture recognition stability approximately 90
   percent with continues picking selection. Each part movements and speed
   of gesture action transition took less than a second with medium hand
   speed with approximately 1 second hand pose for gesture recognition.}},

Abstract = {{CubeSat platforms grow increasingly popular in commercial ventures as
   alternative solutions for global Internet networks deep space
   exploration, and aerospace research endeavors. Many technology companies
   and system engineers plan to implement small satellite systems as part
   of global Low Earth Orbit (LEO) inter-satellite constellations. High
   performing low cost hardware is of key importance in driving these
   efforts. This paper presents the heterodyne architecture and performance
   of Ka-Band Integrated Transmitter Assembly (ITA) Module, which could be
   implemented in nano/microsatellite or other satellite systems as a
   low-cost solution for high data rate space communication systems. The
   module converts a 0.9 to 1.1 GHz IF input signal to deliver linear
   transmission of +29 dBm at 26.7 to 26.9 GHz frequency range with a
   built-in phase locked oscillator, integrated transmitter, polarizer, and

Abstract = {{Synthetic transmit aperture beamforming is an increasingly used method
   to improve resolution in biomedical ultrasound imaging. Synthetic
   aperture sequential beamforming (SASB) is an implementation of this
   concept which features a relatively low computation complexity.
   Moreover, it can be implemented in a dual-stage architecture, where the
   first stage only applies simple single receive-focused delay-and-sum
   (srDAS) operations, while the second, more complex stage is performed
   either locally or remotely using more powerful processing. However, like
   traditional DAS-based beamforming methods, SASB is susceptible to
   inaccurate speed-of-sound (SOS) information. In this paper, we show how
   SOS estimation can be implemented using the srDAS beamformed image, and
   integrated into the dual-stage implementation of SASB, in an effort to
   obtain high resolution images with relatively low-cost hardware. Our
   approach builds on an existing per-channel radio frequency data-based
   direct estimation method, and applies an iterative refinement of the
   estimate. We use this estimate for SOS compensation, without the need to
   repeat the first stage beamforming. The proposed and previous methods
   are tested on both simulation and experimental studies. The accuracy of
   our SOS estimation method is on average 0.38\% in simulation studies and
   0.55\% in phantom experiments, when the underlying SOS in the media is
   within the range 1450-1620 m/s. Using the estimated SOS, the beamforming
   lateral resolution of SASB is improved on average 52.6\% in simulation
   studies and 50.0\% in phantom experiments.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a light-weight rapid control prototyping (RCP)
   system based on off-the-shelf open source hardware to achieve high
   performance computing, cost effectiveness, portability, and easy
   accessiblity. The proposed RCP system consists of a PC-based
   computer-aided control system design (CACSD) tool for computing control
   action and tiny palm-sized open source hardware for input and output
   (I/O) operation and data transfer through a built-in high-speed USB
   interface. The popular-priced and portable open source hardware is used
   as a bridge between CACSD tools and real plants to deliver the control
   and sensor data at the sampling time points. Ten I/O function blocks
   written in C code are developed based on the CACSD tool employed for the
   proposed light-weight RCP system in order to handle I/O operation in a
   simple way. In addition, we suggest two practical strategies, a batch
   transfer strategy and a variable sampling period method, to increase the
   sampling rate of the control system. It is shown through experiment that
   the proposed light-weight RCP system works well up to a sampling rate of
   2 kHz without adopting expensive hardware and C code generators. It is
   expected that the proposed RCP system will be considered as affordable
   and readily available to schools for mass education.}},

   hydrodynamic coefficients of a surface vessel from the free running test
   using an experimental modelling method. Working as the embedded platform
   and data acquisition card, myRIO was utilized to control the scaled
   model, namely `P\&O Nedlloyd Hoorn', and measure her motion states using
   low cost sensors including a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver,
   accelerometer, gyroscope and digital compass. System identification was
   conducted utilizing the processed experimental data with Kalman filter
   to estimate the hydrodynamic coefficients of a mathematical model in
   four degree of freedom (DOF) including surge, sway, yaw and roll. The
   developed mathematical model of the scaled model was validated through
   the comparison between the experimental data and simulation results. It
   has demonstrated that the proposed low cost hardware and system
   identification algorithm is capable of estimating hydrodynamic
   coefficients of the proposed mathematical model of the scaled surface

Abstract = {{Purpose - Smart eyewear, such as augmented or virtual reality headset,
   allows the projection of virtual content through a display worn on the
   user's head. This paper aims to present a mobile platform, named
   ``CARTON{''}, which transforms a smartphone into smart eyewear,
   following a do-it-yourself (DIY) approach. This platform is composed of
   three main components: a blueprint to build the hardware prototype with
   very simple materials and regular tools; a software development kit
   (SDK) to help with the development of new applications (e.g. augmented
   reality app); and, finally, a second SDK (ControlWear) to interact with
   mobile applications through a Smartwatch.
   Design/methodology/approach - User experiments were conducted, in which
   participants were asked to create, by themselves, the CARTON's hardware
   part and perform usability tests with their own creation. A second round
   of experimentation was conducted to evaluate three different interaction
   modalities.
   Findings - Qualitative user feedback and quantitative results prove that
   CARTON is functional and feasible to anyone, without specific skills.
   The results also showed that ControlWear had the most positive results,
   compared with the other interaction modalities, and that user
   interaction preference would vary depending on the task.
   Originality/value - The authors describe a novel way to create a smart
   eyewear available for a wide audience around the world. By providing
   everything open-source and open-hardware, they intend to solve the
   reachability of technologies related to smart eyewear and aim to
   accelerate research around it.}},

Abstract = {{This paper elucidates the design and implementation of a low-cost
   wireless intelligent two hand gesture recognition system. The proposed
   system consists of a primary and secondary sub-system which work in
   tandem to recognize static gestures signed by the user. Each of the
   sub-systems consists of a sensory glove, embedded with custom made,
   low-cost flex and contact sensors interfaced with a ATMega328
   microcontroller. The two sub-systems are wirelessly inter-connected
   through a pair of TI's CC2541 Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) modules. The
   system recognizes gestures with the help of a Dual-mode Intelligent
   Agent (DIA) which operates in Identification Mode (IM) and intelligently
   switches to Enhanced Identification Mode (EIM) when the gesture fails to
   get recognized in IM. The EIM incorporates a Bit Stream Error
   Elimination (BSEE) algorithm which enhances the gesture recognition
   accuracy without the addition of any external hardware. The performance
   of the system was evaluated using a data set comprising of 196 static
   gestures from eight globally used sign languages. The system efficiency
   was found to be 80.06\% in IM and was enhanced to 93.16\% in EIM. The
   cost of the proposed system in prototype stage is USD 22, which the
   authors believe could be realized at under USD 10 on commercialization.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The advantages of 3D reconstruction, immersive virtual
   reality (VR) and 3D printing in abdominal surgery have been enunciated
   for many years, but still today their application in routine clinical
   practice is almost nil. We investigate their feasibility, user
   appreciation and clinical impact.
   Material and methods: Fifteen patients undergoing pancreatic, hepatic or
   renal surgery were studied realizing a 3D reconstruction of target
   anatomy. Then, an immersive VR environment was developed to import 3D
   models, and some details of the 3D scene were printed. All the phases of
   our workflow employed open-source software and low-cost hardware, easily
   implementable by other surgical services. A qualitative evaluation of
   the three approaches was performed by 20 surgeons, who filled in a
   specific questionnaire regarding a clinical case for each organ
   considered.
   Results: Preoperative surgical planning and intraoperative guidance was
   feasible for all patients included in the study. The vast majority of
   surgeons interviewed scored their quality and usefulness as very good.
   Conclusions: Despite extra time, costs and efforts necessary to
   implement these systems, the benefits shown by the analysis of
   questionnaires recommend to invest more resources to train physicians to
   adopt these technologies routinely, even if further and larger studies
   are still mandatory.}},

Abstract = {{Recent moves by many Great Basin and California scholars to connect the
   ethnographic record with archaeological evidence have fostered new
   understandings of the interconnected relationship between landscape,
   human behavior, and cosmology. Oral tradition and ethnographic
   commentary reinvigorate rock art research, once emblematic of
   interpretive impasses. Phenomena described as spirit voices connect
   multisensory religious experiences associated with such sites
   distributed throughout the region, and possibly result from rituals
   inherent in producing and interacting with painted and engraved images.
   The prolific `pecking' production technique exemplifies actions which
   would result in both auditory experiences and durable visible traces.
   Recent fieldwork at a rock art site situated at the juncture of the
   Great Basin and Mojave Desert tested the propagation of sounds
   comparable to those generated with this technique. Preliminary results
   of ongoing analysis, reported here, demonstrate how low-cost equipment
   and zero-trace methods can be mobilized to generate useful and
   compelling data for addressing complex sensitive matters of non-western
   ontologies, all while remaining committed to the framework of the
   scientific method.}},

   Most of existing methods energy performance are very poor in terms of
   communication latency and communication overhead. We propose an energy
   aware end-to-end trust mechanism for IoT healthcare applications. We
   discuss how to provide end to end trust for IoT health applications and
   how to improve the efficiency of health care applications. The results
   of the evaluation determine the effectiveness of proposed method. When

   detecting nearly 1,800 clone sets with approximately 80\% precision. We
   compared code clones in Verilog HDL with those in Java/C based on the
   metrics to identify the differences among languages. We identified
   patterns on how code clones are created in Verilog HDL, which include
   cases for increasing stability and capability of parallel processing of

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a solution for the
   levelling plate of fused deposition modelling (FDM) additive
   manufacturing (AM) systems. This automatic levelling system is presented
   as an evolution of actual systems, which uses a new ultrasound sensing
   system.
   Design/methodology/approach - After obtaining a prototype, different
   tests were conducted for getting a system which solves the level plate
   problem and can be mounted in any FDM AM machine. Several benchmark
   models were obtained and compared with current equipment concepts for
   the validity of the product.
   Findings - All tests were performed with high accuracy, enabling the
   production of geometries that could not have been achieved without this
   novel system.
   Practical implications - This development will enable experienced users
   to set aside the problems of calibration and focus on the purpose of
   this type of machines, making prototypes.
   Originality/value - A system architecture has been developed and
   integrated into an open hardware AM system, allowing real-time
   adjustment of the plate during each layer, thus eliminating the need of
   levelling the plate, allowing to achieve easier printing, and without
   increasing the cost significantly.}},

Title = {{Investigation of additive manufacturing surface smoothing process}},
Journal = {{RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{201-208}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The additive manufacturing technologies have been facing an
   extraordinary growth along the past years. This phenomenon might be
   correlated with rise of low-cost FDM technologies into the
   non-professional market segment. In contrast with that, among the main
   disadvantages found in this sort of equipment are the final object
   finishing and low mechanical strength. For that reason, the purpose of
   this paper is to present and characterise a surface treatment which is
   based on solvent vapour attack and that is also known as smoothing
   process. In addition, a concise overview about the theory beneath this
   process is presented besides an experimental study that evaluates the
   main effects on the mechanical properties of object.
   Design/methodology/approach - To analyse the benefits of this process,
   the authors preliminarily investigated the working mechanism that
   supports such surface treatment. It allowed them to identify and select
   a proper solvent for each material. The authors have also established
   that the exposure time repetition numbers (passes) were the main
   variables, whereas temperature, solvent type, drying time, object
   direction and object shape were constants. The main object dimensions,
   surface roughness, absorbed solvent mass and mechanical strength were
   the main study responses.
   Findings - As a result of this work, the peak-peak roughness was reduced
   in 71 per cent, indicating the potential benefit of this process. On the
   other hand, excessive solvent exposure implied on relevant dimensional
   distortions and internal disruptures. It was also possible to see that
   the vapourised solvent penetrate into the object surface and fused
   layers and filaments. As consequence, the mechanical strength was also
   improved.
   Originality/value - Despite the growth that additive manufacturing
   market segment has seen along the past years, the finishing and
   mechanical strength of low-cost equipment still lack for improvements.
   For that reason, applications like solvent vapour attack or smoothing
   process new perspectives for this non-professional segment, whereas
   roughness and mechanical strength are improved after its treatment. As a
   consequence, it is possible to consider a final object to be obtained
   directly from low-cost FDM in combination with smoothing process.}},

Abstract = {{Functionality and cost are two key factors for open architecture machine
   tools. Dynamic reconfiguration technology provides a method to achieve
   more functions at low cost. Hardware dynamic reconfiguration is special
   feature of FPGA devices. In this paper, a dynamic reconfigurable
   interpolator with linear, circular and NURBS interpolations is
   presented. The functions of interpolator can be reconfigured during
   machining. The requirement for logic resource on-chip reduces evidently,
   which makes it feasible to implement complicated interpolations using a
   limited area. Experimental results are presented to verify the
   performance of the dynamic reconfigurable interpolator.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic phenomena on nanoscale have continuously attracted attention
   from various research fields. However, due to the limit of the imaging
   rate, it is difficult to observe the dynamic processes by conventional
   atomic force microscope (AFM). In recent years, a considerable variety
   of important improvements on the AFM system for high-speed imaging have
   been proposed and demonstrated. In this mini review, we briefly present
   the latest research works on the development of high-speed AFM (HSAFM)
   from the view of instrumentation. Besides commercially available
   instruments, many schemes for the design and construction of HSAFM
   system for different applications are summarized. Also, the low-cost
   hardware and software upgrading options from conventional AFM to HSAFM
   are compared. Furthermore, the requirements for each component in the
   AFM control loop are analyzed. Finally, challenges and future works of
   HSAFM are discussed. This review would be beneficial for the development
   of new HSAFM imaging systems.}},

Abstract = {{Presently, mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are being used extensively in
   the defense, private, domestic, etc. fields and each of these emulates a
   personal area network (PAN). A MANET does not require any
   infrastructure; moreover, it can behave as a mobile network. These
   features have boosted the popularity of MANETs in the community. As more
   and more fields become dependent on MANETs, the system needs to be more
   energy aware and low cost. To commercialize MANETs, the routing
   protocols need to be lightweight, secure, and energy efficient, and the
   hardware on which it is to be implemented should be low cost at the same
   time. In this paper, we have proposed a lightweight, energy aware,
   secure routing model for MANETs, which has been implemented on low-cost
   hardware. Our model uses fidelity to allocate trust to a neighbor,
   thereby taking the decision whether to send data via that secure
   neighbor or not. It also uses packets like Report and Recommendation
   that help the protocol to detect and eliminate the malicious nodes from
   the network. To make the protocol energy aware we have formulated new
   battery thresholds, so that the battery can be monitored and losses can
   be minimized. To observe the results we implement this protocol in
   hardware, on the Arduino platform, which is a scalable, reliable, cheap,
   and open source. We observe that our protocol exhibits high packet
   delivery fraction, low normalize routing load, and low end to end delay,
   compared to existing secure routing protocols.}},

Journal = {{INFRARED PHYSICS \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{80}},
Pages = {{145-152}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The working principle of nearly all uncooled microbolometer thermal
   imaging systems is based on the rolling shutter principle. This results
   in time delays between rows giving rise to distorted and blurred images
   which are difficult to correlate with, for example instantaneous
   numerical simulation results for nondestructive evaluation. Until today
   high-end and high-cost thermal cameras need to be used for instantaneous
   measurements. Furthermore, quantitative defect evaluation on average
   conductive materials is difficult to perform as a result of the rolling
   shutter blur of the uncooled cameras. In this contribution, a time delay
   compensation method is designed. The developed algorithm is described
   and a measurement routine is elaborated to measure the inter- and
   intra-frame delays between two pixels. Finally, an artificial global
   shutter image sequence is developed using linear interpolation between
   the original fluctuating frames. We will show that by applying our
   proposed method, the intra-frame delay can be predicted and compensated
   with an accuracy of 16 mu s. Besides, there is only made use of low-cost
   equipment to provide a straight-forward methodology which makes it
   applicable for the further integration of low-cost microbolometers in
   industry. This means that we have made the application of low-cost
   microbolometers feasible for instantaneous measurements. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to develop a low cost open source Controller
   Area Network system that simulates electronic controls in modern
   automotive vehicles and to evaluate its effectiveness as a teaching aid.
   The Arduino UNO microcontroller hoard was chosen as the desired hardware
   platform and the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) using
   the Arduino compiler was chosen as the software development environment.
   Both the Arduino Uno and Arduino IDE/compiler are open source and freely
   available to students and staff with no proprietary intellectual
   property costs.
   The Arduino UNO was interfaced with the Arduino Controller Area Network
   Bus (CANBus) shield which is also open hardware. Unitec Institute of
   Technology practices a holistic approach to teaching. As part of its
   holistic approach to teaching, senior students are encouraged to develop
   technical artefacts that can be used as teaching aids for junior
   students, the junior students are introduced to the artefact as part of
   their course and the artefact is used to encourage junior students to
   increase their technical proficiency so that when they reach a senior
   technical level they can develop artefacts too. The holistic approach is
   considered to he self-sustaining and provides positive role modelling
   for junior students. The project described in this paper was developed
   by a senior student and has been used as a teaching aid for junior
   students congruent with the holistic teaching philosophy practiced at
   Unitec. The code and circuitry was designed by an exchange Masters
   student and was used in the papers, APTE 7504 Vehicle Electronic
   Diagnostics and APTE 6505 Automotive Electronics, to help students
   understand CANBus operation and design features in an Automotive CANBus
   application.}},

   was developed using the open source hardware Arduino Pro Mini. This
   paper describes the process of building SKOMOBO, including sensor

   performance evaluation. Two co-located tests have been undertaken; one
   in the controlled environment and one in the uncontrolled environment.
   Results show SKOMOBO measurements have high correlations with their
   commercial equivalents. In the two different testing environments, the
   R-2 of temperature measurements for all six SKOMOBOs were 1. The R-2 for
   relative humidity and CO2 measurements were above 0.9. The result of

Abstract = {{Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are increasingly
   becoming integral parts of many non-electrical fields of engineering,
   e.g., Precision Agriculture, Avionics, Bionics, Civionics, and so on.
   Modern mechanical engineering is nearly synonymous with Mechatronics,
   and more recently Mechaphonics, viz., study of mechanical systems
   controlled by mobile phone apps, has become popular. Pneumatics, or
   compressed air, and hydraulics are niche areas of mechanical engineering
   with many industrial and other applications, and their performance is
   enhanced by incorporating electronic hardware and computer software.
   Many of these systems are also good examples of so-called smart products
   and Internet of Things. In this paper, an affordable build-your-own
   (BYO) computer control system is designed and developed for hands-on
   instruction in electro-pneumatics education. Results of implementation
   of a proof-of-concept prototype system using low-cost components, open
   source hardware and free open source software, are presented to
   illustrate the practical utility of the proposed system.}},

Abstract = {{Prosopis juliflora is a small weed tree, native to Central and South
   America, and the Caribbean, which has become a major invasive weed in
   Asia, including India, Latin America, Africa and Australia. It has major
   detrimental impact on scarce, underground water resources, takes over
   the local flora ecosystems and affects the soil environment. Manual
   removal of saplings is time-consuming and expensive. Presently, the
   removal of the weed is performed manually which is time-consuming, or
   using very expensive commercial heavy equipment. In this paper, an
   affordable and innovative unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) unmanned ground
   vehicle (UGV) system is designed and developed for autonomous
   identification and removal of the weed seedlings and saplings. Results
   of implementation of a proof-of-concept prototype system using mainly
   commercial off-the-shelf components, open source hardware and free open

   temperature and food levels inside reservoirs, in order to have a
   real-time reading of parameters. In case critical values appear, an
   alarm activates by control center, notifying by either electronic mail

   achieve the objectives. In this paper, underwater acoustic distance
   measurement system based on fast Fourier transform (FFT) overlap using
   low cost hardware platform is presented. Time-of-arrival (TOA)
   estimation is derived based on the intensity of the received signal with
   frequency of interest after computing forward FFT. The extraction of the
   signal from the receiver is performed by using digital signal processing
   algorithms. Strength of the received signal and its distance from the
   receiver are measured during the experiments. The experimental results
   are presented to demonstrate its capabilities.}},

Abstract = {{The Indian `smart cities' have burgeoning population consuming the
   intelligent systems running over the city infrastructure and services.
   One critical set of such services is that of the emergency services
   involving Ambulances, Police and Firefighters. The services provided by
   these officials are often time critical, which makes their easy and
   quick availability a must have attribute. This paper proposes a solution
   to make such services available to those in need ensuring minimum
   response time. The proposed solution is based on capturing live location
   of the emergency services. This will enable the citizen in need to
   connect to the nearest available officials. The primary contribution of
   this paper is that it provides a scalable solution that can be
   extrapolated to entire city where the number of users using this system
   will be in millions. Every emergency service official will have an
   internet and Global Positioning System (GPS) enabled device (Smartphone
   or low cost hardware module) that will keep streaming live location data
   to servers. User when in need can get contact details of the nearest
   available official, which will minimize time involved in the official
   reaching the user. Security of the location data also has been handled
   in the proposed solution. The existing location tracking systems will
   not be able to handle the tremendous data traffic coming from entire
   city population. This paper proposes a back-end architecture that will
   be future ready to handle such huge number of users.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a case study on emerging challenges within
   collaborative innovation projects engaging open communities. Innovation
   driven by open communities has proven to have a significant potential,
   in particular for open source software. However, tools and methodologies
   enabling the supervision of collaborative innovation involving open
   communities, in the perspective of creating open hardware to solve
   societal issues, remains at the early stages. This paper seeks to
   pinpoint the potentialities and challenges of such projects toward
   defining methods to better support a multi-stakeholders open source
   collaboration context. The experimental field of this research concerns
   the smart electricity distribution, and more precisely a public driven
   project of the diffusion of smart-meters in France and their
   appropriation by open source communities, with the involvement of the
   university and a public industrial company. The project seeks to study
   how these communities of users develop in a collaborative manner, new
   products and services using the smart-meter as a support technology. The
   first results show that the open community makes natural connection on
   specific environments such as Smart buildings to materialize usages of
   smart meters.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a pedestrian detection pipeline consisting of an
   Intel RealSense R200 camera used for input to a Single Shot Multibox
   Detector based neural network for pedestrian detection. Unlike prior

   establishes the distance of a pedestrian from the camera using
   stereoscopy in realtime using commonly available low cost hardware.
   Two networks are presented for pedestrian detection, the Single Shot
   Multibox Detector (SSD) 512, and the InceptionV4 network which has been
   modified to use the SSD design for pedestrian detection. Both networks
   are trained on a dataset created from footage captured at a Fulton Hogan
   site. The SSD InceptionV4 network achieves 1\% mAP on the PASCAL VOC
   2007 test dataset and 51\% mAP on the Fulton Hogan dataset. The SSD 512
   network achieves 93\% mAP on the Fulton Hogan dataset and 66\% mAP on

   and Automation (GIEA) so that they can be followed by students in the
   blended learning modality. We focus on how to offer the practical
   training, so that GIEA Engineering students acquire the required
   practical skills. We discuss and propose solutions that combine several
   of the main available tools for teaching practical training: Virtual
   labs (VL) built on OpenSource and free programs, VLs accessible through
   virtual desktops, Home labs, composed of low cost hardware kits, Remote
   Labs with hardware components that can be accessed remotely, and
   Face-to-face practical training, physically at the laboratories of the
   University. This study has been performed at the Escuela Universitaria
   Politecnica de Teruel (EUPT), University of Zaragoza, which plans to
   gradually introduce the blended learning modality in all the courses
   offered to GIEA undergraduate students.}},

   added value for the achievement of projects by students of arts and

   on the other we are enabling students to use open technologies, so that
   they can use them with respect to their licenses.
   These technologies, often presented as difficult to use, with long
   learning curves, compared to other programs whose students and some
   teachers are more accustomed to use, have a greater value if they can be
   used freely and in any type of project. Whether in an academic setting
   or in the final product environment for a particular client.
   It is important to de-emphasize their use with the students and to show
   that they can be used in the classroom in a creative way or to carry out

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a low-cost AC meter designed to continuously

   interface, thus allowing the user to change the firmware to match their
   particular use case using Arduino libraries or standard C language. The
   suggested design is compatible with the Raspberry Pi 3(2), making it a
   suitable real-time measurement accessory for the single board computer.
   The platform features an 8 channel simultaneous sampling
   Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) which allows a high fidelity sampling
   without time offsets. Depending on how the user decides to combine
   current transformers (CTs) and AC-AC voltage adapters for the input
   channels, circuit breakers or appliances can be measured in either one

Abstract = {{Ambient Intelligence is growing phenomena caused by advances of speed
   and size of computational hardware. It is possible to collect data from
   various sensors, devices or services and react to evaluated event and
   start the predefined process. These systems are closely connected with
   Cloud based services as they provide publicly available interface for
   management and visualization, computational and storage capabilities for
   forecasts and other advanced data processing to create ambient
   intelligence environment. The true ambient environments react to the
   presence of people and the sensors and actuators have become part of the
   environment.
   This article presents RoboPhery project aimed to provide abstraction
   layer for interfacing any low cost hardware sensors and actuators with
   MQTT and Time-series Database bindings, that can serve as sensory
   network for Ambient Intelligence environments. The service architecture
   is designed to be so simple at hardware level to support single-board
   microcontrollers like ESP2866, ESP32 modules as well as single-board
   computers based on ARM or x86 architectures. The communication among
   individual devices is handled by the standard MQTT messages. The same
   devices can be configured to support multiple use-cases on configuration
   level to lower the operational costs of the solution.}},

Abstract = {{Achieving data-rates of multiple Gbps in 60 GHz millimeter-wave
   (mm-wave) communication systems requires efficient beam-steering
   algorithms. To find the optimal steering direction on IEEE 802.11ad
   compatible devices, state-of-the-art approaches sweep through all
   predefined antenna sectors. Recently, much more efficient alternatives,
   such as compressive path tracking, have been proposed, which scale well
   even with arrays with thousands of antenna elements. However, such have
   not yet been integrated into consumer devices. In this work, we adapt
   compressive path tracking for sector selection in off-the-shelf IEEE
   802.11ad devices. In contrast to existing solutions, our compressive
   sector selection tolerates the imperfections of low-cost hardware,
   tracks beam directions in 3D and does not rely on pseudo-random beams.
   We implement our protocol on a commodity router, the TP-Link Talon
   AD7200, by modifying the sector sweep algorithm in the IEEE 802.11ad
   chip's firmware. In particular, we modify the firmware to obtain the
   signal strength of received frames and to select custom sectors. Using
   this extension, we precisely measure the device's sector patterns. We
   then select the best sector based on the measured patterns and sweep
   only through a subset of probing sectors. Our results demonstrate, that
   our protocol outperforms the existing sector sweep, increases stability,
   and speeds up the sector selection by factor 2.3.}},

Title = {{Use of Open Source Hardware and Software Platforms to Quantify
   Spectrally Dependent Differences in Photochemical Efficiency and
   Functional Absorption Cross Section within the Dinoflagellate
   Symbiodinium spp.}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE}},

Abstract = {{Active chlorophyll a fluorescence is an essential tool for understanding
   photosynthetic activity within cnidarian/dinoflagellate symbioses.
   Fluorescence measurement is typically achieved by utilizing a blue or
   red monochromatic excitation light source. However, algal photosynthetic
   pigments can differ in their absorption spectra, potentially leading to
   excitation wavelength dependent measurements of maximal and light
   acclimated PSII photosynthetic quantum yield (Fv/Fm or Fq'/Fm') and
   functional absorption cross section (sigma(PSII) or sigma(PSII)). Here
   we utilized an open source hardware development platform to construct a
   multispectral excitation fluorometer to assess spectrally dependent
   differences in photochemistry within four different Symbiodinium species
   (two of each ITS2-type A4 and B1). Multivariate analysis of light
   acclimated photochemical signatures showed separation between most alga
   types. These spectrally dependent differences in light acclimated PSII
   efficiency and PSII functional absorption cross section likely reflect
   changes in light harvesting compounds, their connectivity to the PSII
   reaction centers and the balance between photochemical and
   non-photochemical fluorescence quenching. Additionally, acclimation to
   low (20 iLmol photons M-2 s(-1)) and high (200 mu mol photons m(-2)
   s(-1)) light conditions was examined in two of these symbionts types
   (ITS-2 type A4 and B1) As expected, chlorophyll a cell(-1) decreased
   under high light acclimation in both symbionts. However, only A4 saw a
   subsequent reduction in absorbance whereas cellular volume decreased in
   the B1 (S. minutum) symbiont. In response to high light acclimation,
   Fv/Fm was significantly lower at all excitation wavelengths for the B1
   symbiont where as efficiencies remained the same for A4. However,
   high-light acclimated Fq'/Fm' levels decreased in both symbionts, but
   only when measured using the 615 or 625 nm excitation wavelengths.
   Non-photochemical quenching within the antennae bed was downregulated
   under high light acclimation in the A4 symbiont, but only when measured
   using the 505 and 530 nm excitation wavelengths. Such changes in Fq'/Fm'
   and antennae bed quenching highlight the benefits of spectrally resolved
   photochemical measurements. Additionally, the utilization of Arduino and
   Bitscope hardware exemplifies the potential of open source development
   platforms for construction of highly customizable instrumentation for
   photosynthetic research.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs) have been large, complex
   and expensive. Development of UUVs has been driven by defense and
   commercial requirements. This has allowed for extensive research and
   development budgets and long development cycles. This paper briefly
   discuses these historic drivers and how this situation has changed. It
   focuses on a new compact affordable UUV.
   In 2015, several veterans of the conventional UUV sector set out to
   change the dynamics of the industry, founding Riptide Autonomous
   Solutions. Riptide's first offering was the micro-UUV, a new, highly
   flexible, open source autonomous undersea vehicle. The micro-UUV
   features open hardware and software interfaces giving users a reliable
   and robust platform to advance technology development. The vehicle
   design is optimized for high efficiency with the best hydrodynamic
   signature in its class. The base micro-UUV is 4 7/8 inches in diameter,
   40 inches in length and weighs 22 lbs. The standard system is rated to a
   depth of 300 meters.
   This paper discuses the technical details of this UUV that make it
   distinctive and enabled its rapid development. The entire system was
   taken from design to initial delivery in under 12 months. Flexible and
   open software interfaces and use of modern three dimensional design and
   printing are key enablers of the rapid development. A highly optimized
   hydrodynamic design improves the speed and endurance of the vehicle, as
   does its compact size. Reducing control fins from the typical four to
   three reduces drag and enables active roll control steering, a further
   enhancement of the micro-UUV's performance. In addition to describing
   the novel features and approach of the micro-UUV design this paper will
   discuss the potential for a new aluminum seawater battery to extend the

Abstract = {{This paper presents the usage of Internet of Things concept as a tool
   for retrofitting air conditioning systems. The proposed technology
   consists in an embedded system developed with an open-source hardware

   network. By learning commands from the air conditioner's remote control,
   the system is capable of implementing automatic control of the air
   conditioner equipment. Through a central command unit, it is possible to
   configure timers to turn on and off all devices connected to the
   network. The system also adds intelligence to conventional equipment by
   making use of a motion sensor, avoiding electricity waste. An automatic
   temperature control is implemented through sensors that monitor external
   conditions. By making use of a mesh network based on DigiMesh protocol,
   each device acts like a router, increasing network range and making it
   easier to add or remove new devices. The proposed system was validated
   through case study.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) solution is proposed for
   soil's condition measurement to monitor oil palm plantations (PalmNET)
   according to agricultural meteorological practices. The PalmNET

   condition measurement and a web-server interface for data visualization.
   PalmNET can automatically collect soil moisture data and transmit field
   data through a ZigBee network to a web-server. The PalmNET
   proof-of-concept is a WSN built upon open-source hardware and software,
   which includes two sensor nodes, a sink and a Gateway with a GPRS
   module. The WSN was deployed in Palmar de la Vizcaina Experimental Field
   Station having the following proof of concept objectives: (i) collect
   and centralize soil moisture data and (ii) post data to a web

Abstract = {{Visual sensing can be difficult to incorporate into undergraduate
   robotics and AI assignments. Images, after all, do not provide a direct
   estimate of the geometric conditions within the field of view. Yet
   vision is increasingly compelling as a part of undergraduate AI and
   robotics, given the centrality of pixels in our students' interactions
   with technology and each other. This paper shares a small-footprint
   framework designed to make visual sensing as easy to incorporate into AI
   projects and assignments, e.g., as a source of evidence for localization
   algorithms, as range sensors. The framework leverages (hand-built)
   circular panoramas and the image-matching capabilities provided by
   OpenCV's python library. An example localization project highlights its
   pedagogical accessibility and ease of deployment atop low-cost hardware
   and alongside other sensors.}},

Abstract = {{The bending stiffness of the wind turbine blades has decreased due to
   the trend of wind turbine upsizing. Consequently, the risk of blades
   breakage by hitting the tower has increased. In order to prevent such
   incidents, this study proposes a deflection monitoring system that can
   be installed to already operating wind turbine's blades. The monitoring
   system is composed of an estimation algorithm to detect blade deflection
   and a wireless sensor network as a hardware equipment. As for the
   estimation method for blade deflection, a strain-based estimation
   algorithm and an objective function for optimal sensor arrangement are
   proposed. Strain-based estimation algorithm is using a linear
   correlation between strain and deflections, which can be expressed in a
   form of a transformation matrix. The objective function includes the
   terms of strain sensitivity and condition number of the transformation
   matrix between strain and deflection. In order to calculate the
   objective function, a simplified experimental model of the blade is
   constructed by interpolating the mode shape of a blade from modal
   testing. The interpolation method is effective considering a practical
   use to operating wind turbines' blades since it is not necessary to
   establish a finite element model of a blade. On the other hand, a sensor
   network with wireless connection with an open source hardware is
   developed. It is installed to a 300 W scale wind turbine and vibration
   of the blade on operation is investigated. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper reviews a new real-time measurement instrument dedicated for
   online neutron monitoring with fission chambers in nuclear reactors. The
   instrument implements the higher order Campbelling methods and
   self-monitoring capabilities on an open source development board. The
   board includes an CPU/FPGA System on a Chip.
   The feasibility of the measurement instrument was tested both in
   laboratory with a signal generator and in the Minerve reactor. It is
   shown that the instrument provides reliable and robust count rate
   estimation over a wide reactor power range based on the third order
   statistics of the fission chamber signal. In addition, the system is
   able to identify whether the measured count rate change is due to the
   malfunction of the detector or due to the change in the neutron flux.
   The applied self-monitoring method is based on the spectral properties
   of the fission chamber signal. During the experimental verification, the
   considered malfunction was the change of the polarization voltage. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a low cost hardware decoder design and architecture
   that supports general string matching (SM) using both a primary
   reference buffer (PRB) and a secondary reference buffer (SRB). An SM
   decoding module mainly performs string copy operation. The SM decoding
   module can also support intra block copy and palette decoding because
   both are actually two special cases of general string copy. The proposed
   architecture has four pipeline stages. The theoretical lowest system
   clock frequency required to guarantee worst case string copy operation
   using single-port SRAM is lower than the video output pixel rate, which
   is the product of frame resolution and frame rate. The design uses four
   pieces of SRAMs with size of 24K bytes, 16.5K bytes, 4K bytes, and 3K
   bytes, respectively. The first one is specific to SM and the other three
   are shared by traditional hybrid decoding operations. The SM decoding
   module has 69.5K logic gate count and can achieve 60 fps real time SM
   decoding for 4K (4096 x 2160) video at 218 MHz working frequency.}},

Abstract = {{Sustainability of irrigation practices is an important objective to be
   pursued in many countries, especially in regions where water scarcity
   causes strong conflicts among different water uses. The efficient use of
   irrigation water is a key factor in coping with the food demands of an
   increasing world population and with the negative effects of climate
   change on water resource availability in many areas. In this complex
   context, it is important that farmers can rely on instruments and
   practices that enable a better management of water at the field scale,
   whatever the irrigation method they adopt.
   In this paper, we present an open-hardware device based on the Arduino
   technology that was developed to allow the continuous monitoring of soil
   water potential in the root zone for supporting irrigation scheduling at
   the field scale. The structure of the device is flexible and can be
   adapted to host different types of sensors. The results, obtained
   managing irrigation in a peach orchard, show that adoption of the
   device, together with a simple irrigation scheduling criterion, allowed
   a significant increase of water use efficiency without causing a
   reduction of the quantity and quality of crop production. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{An in-house solution for the verification of dose delivered to a moving
   phantom as required for the clinical implementation of lung stereotactic
   ablative body radiation therapy was developed. The superior-inferior
   movement required to simulate tumour motion during a normal breathing
   cycle was achieved via the novel use of an Arduino Uno (TM), a low-cost
   open-source microcontroller board connected to a high torque servo
   motor. Slow CT imaging was used to acquire the image set and a 4D cone
   beam CT (4D-CBCT) verified the efficacy of contoured margins before
   treatment on the moving phantom. Treatment fields were delivered to a
   section of a CIRS (TM) anthropomorphic phantom. Dose verification to the
   dynamic phantom with Gafchromic EBT3 film using 3 \%-1 mm gamma analysis
   acceptance criteria registered an absolute dose pass rate for IMRT and
   VMAT of 98 and 96.6 \%, respectively. It was verified that 100 \% of the
   PTV received the prescribed dose of 12 Gy per fraction using the dynamic
   phantom, and no major discrepancy between planned and measured results
   due to interplay between multileaf collimator sequences and target
   motion was observed. This study confirmed that the use of an in-house
   solution using open source hardware and software with existing quality
   assurance equipment was appropriate in validating a new treatment

Abstract = {{This paper describes an implementation of a highly scalable parallel
   computational facility with high speedup efficiency using relatively
   low-cost hardware, which consists of a cluster of desktop personal
   computers (PCs) connected via a 10-Gigabit Ethernet. Two-levels of
   parallelization were implemented. Communication between different PCs
   was achieved using message passing interface (MPI) protocol. Domain
   decomposition was automated and based on element numbering. Domain
   continuity was assured largely by re-numbering the elements using a
   ``front squasher{''} code prior to decomposition. Within each PC, the
   shared memory parallelization was implemented using either the open
   multiprocessing (OpenMP) or the MPI protocol. Analysis of three
   different problems with number of degrees-of-freedom ranging from about
   129,000 to about 2,260,000 shows a speedup efficiency generally above
   70\%. Super-linear speedup was achieved in several of the cases examined
   in this study, with the hybrid MPI-OpenMP approach generally performing
   better compared to the pure MPI method for parallelization. The results
   demonstrate the feasibility of acquiring a parallel computing facility
   with relatively modest outlay that is within the reach of consulting or
   engineering offices. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Eye tracking methods are usually focused on obtaining the highest
   spatial precision as possible, locating the centre of the pupil and the
   point of gaze for a series of frames. However, for the analysis of eye
   movements such as saccades or fixations, the temporal precision needs to
   be optimised as well. The results should not only be precise, but also
   stable. Eye tracking using low-cost hardware such as webcams brings a
   new series of challenges that have to be specifically taken into
   account. Noise, low resolution and low frame rates are some of these
   challenges, which in the end are the cause of temporal instabilities
   that negatively affect the results. This paper proposes a measure for
   temporal stability of pupil detection algorithms, applied on video
   streams obtained from webcams. The aim of this metric is to compare and
   evaluate the temporal stability of different algorithms (following a
   multi-layered approach for pupil detection), in order to identify which
   one is more adequate to its use for movement detection using low-cost
   hardware. The obtained results show how the temporal stability of
   different algorithms is affected by several factors. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Switching common-mode voltage (CMV) generated by the pulse width
   modulation (PWM) of the inverter causes common-mode currents, which lead
   to motor bearing failures and electromagnetic interference problems in
   multiphase drives. Such switching CMV can be reduced by taking advantage
   of the switching states of multilevel multiphase inverters that produce
   zero CMV. Specific space-vector PWM (SVPWM) techniques with CMV
   elimination, which only use zero CMV states, have been proposed for
   three-level five-phase drives, and for open-end winding five-, six-, and
   seven-phase drives, but such methods cannot be extended to a higher
   number of levels or phases. This paper presents a general (for any
   number of levels and phases) SVPMW with CMV elimination. The proposed

Abstract = {{In order to develop improved diagnosis and therapies for the highly
   prevalent chronic fibroproliferative diseases, it is of utmost
   importance to construct efficient assays to detect collagen biomarkers.
   We have successfully created a paper-based FRET assay for the fast,
   inexpensive and direct detection of collagen triple helix. We have
   demonstrated that the adsorption of the dye-labeled probe peptide onto
   the GO-immobilized paper quenches the fluorescence of the dye, while the
   hybridization of the probe peptide with the target collagen peptide
   results in the desorption of the probe peptide from GO, thus restoring
   the fluorescence. We have also shown that this novel assay is highly
   specific to the target collagen peptide sequence with little
   interference from other proteins, and it can be applied for quantitative
   detection in complex biological fluids. Our integration of the GO-based
   FRET assay with a patterned paper provides a powerful new tool for the
   detection of collagen molecules with many superior features: tiny
   volumes of samples, multichannel detection mode, easy operation and
   low-cost equipment. This assay may have promising applications to fast
   screen multiple target collagen sequences for the discovery of new
   collagen biomarkers.}},

Journal = {{NEUROCOMPUTING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{214}},
Pages = {{280-296}},
Month = {{NOV 19}},
Abstract = {{Although functionalities of the brain are mostly explained using nerve
   cells and synapses, but there are a larger number of other types of
   cells providing support and protection for neurons in the central
   nervous system (CNS). Among a variety of these non-neuronal cells,
   astrocytes are the most abundant cell types which act as supportive
   cells in the brain. The important role of astrocyte such as
   extracellular regulation, synaptic information regulation, neuronal
   synchronization and feedback to neural activity, make the astrocytes
   play a vital role for interacting with neurons in the brain. On the
   other hand, astrocytes provide feedback to neurons for modulating their
   neuronal activity.
   This paper presents a set of equation as a model to describe the
   mechanisms of neural glial interactions which are implementable on
   digital platforms. The proposed model can be utilized in large scale
   VLSI implementation of the biological neural networks, i.e. neuromorphic
   systems. Simulation results show that the model can precisely reproduce
   different behavior of neural glial interactions. The proposed model is
   investigated in terms of digital implementation feasibility and costs
   while targeting low-cost hardware realization. Hardware synthesis and
   physical realization on FPGA shows that the proposed model can reproduce
   different pathway behavior in neural glial mechanisms with higher
   performance and lower implementation cost compared with the original
   model. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{An open-hardware platform for optogenetics and photobiology}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{In optogenetics, researchers use light and genetically encoded
   photoreceptors to control biological processes with unmatched precision.
   However, outside of neuroscience, the impact of optogenetics has been
   limited by a lack of user-friendly, flexible, accessible hardware. Here,
   we engineer the Light Plate Apparatus (LPA), a device that can deliver
   two independent 310 to 1550 nm light signals to each well of a 24-well
   plate with intensity control over three orders of magnitude and
   millisecond resolution. Signals are programmed using an intuitive web
   tool named Iris. All components can be purchased for under \$400 and the
   device can be assembled and calibrated by a non-expert in one day. We
   use the LPA to precisely control gene expression from blue, green, and
   red light responsive optogenetic tools in bacteria, yeast, and mammalian
   cells and simplify the entrainment of cyanobacterial circadian rhythm.
   The LPA dramatically reduces the entry barrier to optogenetics and
   photobiology experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Today, maker culture as an extension of DIY culture is rapidly spreading
   in the world with the advent of open source hardware. Makers currently
   learn and use practical skills based on different reference designs that
   are available to makers through the Internet. However, Reference design
   of SMAs for makers is not provided sufficiently despite commercial
   applications for shape memory alloys (SMAs) in different industrial
   fields. The objective of this research was to develop reference design
   for actuators based on SMA wires so that makers could easily and quickly
   utilize and learn. This research began by exploring different cases of
   actuators based on SMA wires. Through these case studies, we extracted
   essential parameters and classified cases into the essential parameters
   in order to develop reference design for actuators based on SMA wires.
   In order to prove the validity of reference design developed in this
   research, this reference design was subjected to experiments and tested.}},

   collaborative learning (CL) and industry best practices, integrated with
   information communication technologies, open-source software, and

   embedded systems engineering Master's course. In addition to addressing
   industry requirements in both contents and methodology, the course
   develops capabilities and competencies in problem solving, independent
   learning, teamwork, and technical knowledge. Since PBL methodology alone
   does not ensure teamwork, it was complemented with CL. Design review
   meetings (as described in IEC 61160), deliverables, and organizational
   resources were also introduced to mirror industry demands. This
   structure integrated course content and student academic achievement in
   a simulated industrial environment. The course had students build a
   modular management system for home appliances, implementing control
   software on the ``Arduino{''} open-source platform, as well as using
   wireless communications. The results show that teaching, learning, and
   student assessment processes can be improved by using PBL with CL. In
   addition, the introduction of industry practices, such us peer review

   in the literature regarding the duration of the protocols and the
   exercises and equipment used.
   Objective: To evaluate the benefits of a five-week sensory motor
   training program on the functional performance and postural control of
   young soccer players.
   Methods: The study sample comprised 22 young male soccer players who
   were evaluated using: the Figure-of-Eight Test (F8), Side Hop Test
   (SHT), Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT), and a force platform. The
   players were randomly divided into a control group (N = 10), who
   continued their soccer practice sessions and an intervention group (N =
   12), who continued their soccer practice sessions and were also enrolled
   in a supervised five-week sensory motor training program.
   Results: After the five-week training program, the intervention group
   obtained significant results in the F8, SHT and SEBT, as well as in the
   following parameters: area of pressure of sway center (COP), mean
   velocity and mean frequency of COP.
   Conclusion: The five-week sensory motor training program, carried out
   with easily available and low cost equipment, was effective at improving
   functional performance and postural control in young soccer players. (C)

Abstract = {{Marine processes are observed with sensors from both the ground and
   space over large spatio-temporal scales. Citizen-based contributions can
   fill observational gaps and increase environmental stewardship amongst
   the public. For this purpose, tools and methods for citizen science need
   to (1) complement existing datasets; and (2) be affordable, while
   appealing to different user and developer groups. In this article, tools
   and methods developed in the 7th Framework Programme of European Union
   (EU FP 7) funded project Citclops (citizens' observatories for coast and
   ocean optical monitoring) are reviewed. Tools range from a stand-alone
   smartphone app to devices with Arduino and 3-D printing, and hence are
   attractive to a diversity of users; from the general public to more
   specified maker-and open labware movements. Standardization to common
   water quality parameters and methods allows long-term storage in regular
   marine data repositories, such as SeaDataNet and EMODnet, thereby
   providing open data access. Due to the given intercomparability to
   existing remote sensing datasets, these tools are ready to complement
   the marine datapool. In the future, such combined satellite and citizen
   observations may set measurements by the engaged public in a larger
   context and hence increase their individual meaning. In a wider sense, a
   synoptic use can support research, management authorities, and societies
   at large.}},

Abstract = {{There are currently no standardized objective measures to assess beer
   quality based on the most significant parameters related to the first
   impression from consumers, which are visual characteristics of
   foamability, beer color and bubble size. This study describes the
   development of an affordable and robust robotic beer pourer using
   low-cost sensors, Arduino (R) boards, Lego (R) building blocks and servo
   motors for prototyping. The RoboBEER is also coupled with video capture
   capabilities (iPhone 5S) and automated post hoc computer vision analysis
   algorithms to assess different parameters based on foamability, bubble
   size, alcohol content, temperature, carbon dioxide release and beer
   color. Results have shown that parameters obtained from different beers
   by only using the RoboBEER can be used for their classification
   according to quality and fermentation type. Results were compared to
   sensory analysis techniques using principal component analysis (PCA) and
   artificial neural networks (ANN) techniques. The PCA from RoboBEER data
   explained 73\% of variability within the data. From sensory analysis,
   the PCA explained 67\% of the variability and combining RoboBEER and
   Sensory data, the PCA explained only 59\% of data variability. The ANN
   technique for pattern recognition allowed creating a classification
   model from the parameters obtained with RoboBEER, achieving 92.4\%
   accuracy in the classification according to quality and fermentation
   type, which is consistent with the PCA results using data only from
   RoboBEER. The repeatability and objectivity of beer assessment offered
   by the RoboBEER could translate into the development of an important
   practical tool for food scientists, consumers and retail companies to
   determine differences within beers based on the specific parameters
   studied. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Microbial water quality monitoring for the presence of faecal indicator
   bacteria (FIB) is a mandatory activity in many countries and is key in
   public health protection. Despite technological advances and a need for
   methodological improvements, chromogenic and fluorogenic enzymatic
   techniques remain the mainstays of water quality monitoring for both
   public health agencies and regulated utilities. We demonstrated that
   bioelectroanalytical approaches to FIB enumeration are possible and can
   be achieved using commercially available enzyme-specific resorufin
   glycosides, although these are expensive, not widely available or
   designed for purpose. Following this, we designed two naphthoquinone
   glycosides which performed better, achieving Escherichia coli detection
   in the range 5.0x10(2) to 5.0x10(5) CFUml(-1) 22-54\% quicker than
   commercially available resorufin glycosides. The molecular design of the
   naphthoquinone glycosides requires fewer synthetic steps allowing them
   to be produced for as little as US\$50 per kg. Tests with environmental
   samples demonstrated the low tendency for abiotic interference and that,
   despite specificity being maintained between -glucuronidase and
   -galactosidase, accurate enumeration of E.coli in environmental samples
   necessitates development of a selective medium. In comparison to a
   commercially available detection method, which has U.S. Environmental
   Protection Agency (EPA) approval, our approach performed better at high
   organism concentrations, detecting 500 organisms in 9h compared with
   13.5h for the commercial method. Bioelectroanalytical detection is
   comparable to current approved methods and with further development
   could result in improved detection times. A recent trend for low-cost
   open-source hardware means that automated, potentiostatically controlled
   E.coli detection systems could be constructed for less than US\$100 per
   channel.}},

Abstract = {{Open-source technology not only has facilitated the expansion of the
   greater research community, but by lowering costs it has encouraged
   innovation and customizable design. The field of automated microscopy
   has continued to be a challenge in accessibility due the expense and
   inflexible, noninterchangeable stages. This paper presents a low-cost,
   open-source microscope 3-D stage. A RepRap 3-D printer was converted to
   an optical microscope equipped with a customized, 3-D printed holder for
   a USB microscope. Precision measurements were determined to have an
   average error of 10 m at the maximum speed and 27 m at the minimum
   recorded speed. Accuracy tests yielded an error of 0.15\%. The machine
   is a true 3-D stage and thus able to operate with USB microscopes or
   conventional desktop microscopes. It is larger than all commercial
   alternatives, and is thus capable of high-depth images over
   unprecedented areas and complex geometries. The repeatability is below
   2-D microscope stages, but testing shows that it is adequate for the
   majority of scientific applications. The open-source microscope stage
   costs less than 3-9\% of the closest proprietary commercial stages. This
   extreme affordability vastly improves accessibility for 3-D microscopy

   Lay description The concept of open-source technology stems from the
   developmental model of accessibility and ease of use, enabling an
   environment of continual improvement and open communication. This
   approach has the potential to dramatically change many fields of study
   including that of microscope use in research settings. Automated
   microscopy is often a challenging and inaccessible field due to the cost
   and non-interchangeable stages, the flat plate on which samples are
   placed for analysis. This paper presents a low-cost, open source
   microscope 3-D stage. A RepRap 3-D printer was converted to an optical
   microscope equipped with a customized, 3-D printed holder for a USB
   microscope. Precision measurements were determined to have an average
   error of 10 ?m at the maximum speed and 27 ?m at the minimum recorded
   speed. Accuracy tests yielded an error of 0.15\%. The machine is a true
   3-D stage and thus able to operate with USB microscopes or conventional
   desktop microscopes. Because it is larger than all current commercial
   alternative systems, it is capable of high depth images over
   unprecedented areas and complex geometries. The repeatibility is below
   2-D microscope stages, but testing shows that it is adequate for the
   majority of scientific applications. The open source microscope stage
   costs less than 3\% to 9\% of the closest proprietary commercial stages.
   This extreme affordability vastly improves accessibility for 3-D

Abstract = {{Direct-conversion architectures can offer highly integrated low-cost
   hardware solutions to communication transceivers. However, it has been
   demonstrated that radio frequency (RF) impairments such as amplifier
   nonlinearities, phase noise, and in-phase/quadrature-phase imbalances
   (IQI) can lead to severe degradation of the performance of such systems.
   Motivated by this, the present work is devoted to the quantification and
   evaluation of the effects of RF IQI on wireless communications in the
   context of cascaded fading channels for both single-carrier and
   multicarrier systems. To this end, closed-form expressions are first
   derived for the outage probability ( OP) over N{*} Nakagami-m channels
   for the cases of ideal transmitter ( TX) and receiver ( RX), ideal TX
   and IQI RX, IQI TX and ideal RX, and joint TX/RX IQI. The offered
   expressions, along with several deduced corresponding special cases, are
   subsequently employed in vehicle-to-vehicle ( V2V) communications to
   justify their importance and practical usefulness in the context of
   emerging communication systems. The offered analytic results are
   corroborated by extensive comparisons with respective results from
   computer simulations. It is shown that considering non-ideal RF
   front-ends at the TX and/or RX introduces nonnegligible errors in the OP
   performance that can exceed 20\% under several communication scenarios.
   It is further demonstrated that the effects by cascaded multipath fading
   conditions are particularly detrimental as they typically result in
   considerable performance losses of around or over an order of magnitude.}},

Abstract = {{The development of techniques for the rapid analysis of N-glycans is a
   key step in enabling the roles of glycoproteins in biological processes
   to be studied. Analysis is usually performed through the liberation of
   the carbohydrate moieties from proteins, followed by fluorescent
   labeling and identification using either standardized HPLC or mass
   spectrometry techniques. A simple and robust automated process for the
   release and isolation of N-glycans would greatly improve analytical
   throughput and reproducibility, and is thus highly desirable. Inspired
   by the increasing number of reported projects involving open source
   labware, which allows the design and construction of otherwise
   inaccessible laboratory equipment using low-cost 3D printers, we used
   this technique to fabricate a platform for the automated isolation of
   N-glycans. As a proof of concept, we demonstrated the successful
   recovery of glycan samples from the glycoprotein model fetuin using our
   self-made 3D-printed equipment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Nearly every practical improvement in modeling human motion is well
   founded in a properly designed collection of data or datasets. These
   datasets must be made publicly available for the community could
   validate and accept them. It is reasonable to concede that a collective,
   guided enterprise could serve to devise solid and substantial datasets,
   as a result of a collaborative effort, in the same sense as the open
   software community does. In this way datasets could be complemented,
   extended and expanded in size with, for example, more individuals,
   samples and human actions. For this to be possible some commitments must
   be made by the collaborators, being one of them sharing the same data
   acquisition platform. In this paper, we offer an affordable open source
   hardware and software platform based on inertial wearable sensors in a
   way that several groups could cooperate in the construction of datasets
   through common software suitable for collaboration. Some experimental
   results about the throughput of the overall system are reported showing
   the feasibility of acquiring data from up to 6 sensors with a sampling
   frequency no less than 118 Hz. Also, a proof-of-concept dataset is
   provided comprising sampled data from 12 subjects suitable for gait
   analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we present the results of a low-cost optical monitoring
   station designed for monitoring the kinematics of glaciers in an Alpine
   environment. We developed a complete hardware/software data acquisition
   and processing chain that automatically acquires, stores and
   co-registers images. The system was installed in September 2013 to
   monitor the evolution of the Planpincieux glacier, within the open-air
   laboratory of the Grandes Jorasses, Mont Blanc massif (NW Italy), and
   collected data with an hourly frequency. The acquisition equipment
   consists of a high-resolution DSLR camera operating in the visible band.
   The data are processed with a Pixel Offset algorithm based on normalized
   cross-correlation, to estimate the deformation of the observed glacier.
   We propose a method for the pixel-to-metric conversion and present the
   results of the projection on the mean slope of the glacier. The method
   performances are compared with measurements obtained by GB-SAR, and
   exhibit good agreement. The system provides good support for the
   analysis of the glacier evolution and allows the creation of daily
   displacement maps.}},

Title = {{3D Printing PDMS Elastomer in a Hydrophilic Support Bath via Freeform
   Reversible Embedding}},
Journal = {{ACS BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE \& ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1781-1786}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer is used in a wide range of
   biomaterial applications including microfluidics, cell culture
   substrates, flexible electronics, and medical devices. However, it has
   proved challenging to 3D print PDMS in complex structures due to its low
   elastic modulus and need for support during the printing process. Here
   we demonstrate the 3D printing of hydrophobic PDMS prepolymer resins
   within a hydrophilic Carbopol gel support via freeform reversible
   embedding (FRE). In the FRE printing process, the Carbopol support acts
   as a Bingham plastic that yields and fluidizes when the syringe tip of
   the 3D printer moves through it, but acts as a solid for the PDMS
   extruded within it. This, in combination with the immiscibility of
   hydrophobic PDMS in the hydrophilic Carbopol, confines the PDMS
   prepolymer within the support for curing times up to 72 h while
   maintaining dimensional stability. After printing and curing, the
   Carbopol support gel releases the embedded PDMS prints by using
   phosphate buffered saline solution to reduce the Carbopol yield stress.
   As proof-of-concept, we used Sylgard 184 PDMS to 3D print linear and
   helical filaments via continuous extrusion and cylindrical and helical
   tubes via layer-by-layer fabrication. Importantly, we show that the 3D
   printed tubes were manifold and perfusable. The results demonstrate that
   hydrophobic polymers with low viscosity and long cure times can be 3D
   printed using a hydrophilic support, expanding the range of biomaterials
   that can be used in additive manufacturing. Further, by implementing the
   technology using low cost open-source hardware and software tools, the
   FRE printing technique can be rapidly implemented for research
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{The science education budget of many secondary schools has decreased,
   while shortages and environmental concerns linked to conventional
   Science Education Equipment and Materials (SEEMs) have emerged. Thus, in
   some schools, resourceful educators produce low-cost equipment from
   basic materials and use these so-called improvised SEEMs in practical
   work. However, scattered in the literature are diverse challenges linked
   to the production and/or use of improvised SEEMs. Thus, the purpose of
   the literature review presented here was to design a framework useful in
   the reduction of these challenges. In this regard, we systematically
   gathered, characterised and clarified the challenges, in addition to
   collecting and reflecting on ways of reducing them. This enabled us to
   design the framework which focuses on educator learning and practice in
   the improvisation of SEEMs under specified conditions. Regarding the
   implementation of the framework, we have discussed the role that
   stakeholders including professional development providers and
   researchers may play.}},

Abstract = {{Mesoscale electromechanical systems find applications in fields such as
   medical instrumentation, soft robotics, microscopy, flexible electronics
   and imagining. This paper implements the printed circuit MEMS (PC-MEMS)
   process {[}1] for the fabrication of a `pop-up' flexure-based mesoscale
   system that exploits the simplicity of 2-D manufacturing techniques such
   as sheet-metal operations and laser cutting to realize a 3-D mechanism.
   The fabrication of a laminated Delta robot with prismatic actuation is
   presented to exemplify this process. A working device with actuation and
   functional components such as linear guides, stepper motors and limit
   switches is designed and fully realized. Because the mechanism is popped
   out of the plane to achieve its 3D shape, we present a stiffness
   analysis to arrive at the out-of-plane (or `pop-out') angles that the
   planar system must accommodate so that constraints/limits on actuator
   torque/force can be can satisfied while producing an operational system.
   The simplicity of the processes makes it a candidate for the use in the
   emerging open-source hardware technologies for fabricating low-cost,
   complex, electromechanical systems. (C) 2016 The Society of

Title = {{MultispeQ Beta: a tool for large-scale plant phenotyping connected to

Abstract = {{Large-scale high-throughput plant phenotyping (sometimes called
   phenomics) is becoming increasingly important in plant biology and
   agriculture and is essential to cutting-edge plant breeding and
   management approaches needed to meet the food and fuel needs for the
   next century. Currently, the application of these approaches is severely
   limited by the availability of appropriate instrumentation and by the
   ability to communicate experimental protocols, results and analyses. To
   address these issues, we have developed a low-cost, yet sophisticated
   open-source scientific instrument designed to enable communities of
   researchers, plant breeders, educators, farmers and citizen scientists
   to collect high-quality field data on a large scale. The MultispeQ
   provides measurements in the field or laboratory of both, environmental
   conditions (light intensity and quality, temperature, humidity, CO2
   levels, time and location) and useful plant phenotypes, including
   photosynthetic parameters-photosystem II quantum yield (FII),
   non-photochemical exciton quenching (NPQ), photosystem II
   photoinhibition, light-driven proton translocation and thylakoid proton
   motive force, regulation of the chloroplast ATP synthase and potentially
   many others-and leaf chlorophyll and other pigments. Plant phenotype
   data are transmitted from the MultispeQ to mobile devices, laptops or
   desktop computers together with key metadata that gets saved to the
   PhotosynQ platform (https://photosynq.org) and provides a suite of
   web-based tools for sharing, visualization, filtering, dissemination and
   analyses. We present validation experiments, comparing MultispeQ results
   with established platforms, and show that it can be usefully deployed in
   both laboratory and field settings. We present evidence that MultispeQ
   can be used by communities of researchers to rapidly measure, store and
   analyse multiple environmental and plant properties, allowing for deeper
   understanding of the complex interactions between plants and their
   environment.}},

Journal = {{MACHINES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The use of lasers to weld polymer sheets provides a means of
   highly-adaptive and custom additive manufacturing for a wide array of
   industrial, medical, and end user/consumer applications. This paper
   provides an open source design for a laser polymer welding system, which
   can be fabricated with low-cost fused filament fabrication and
   off-the-shelf mechanical and electrical parts. The system is controlled
   with free and open source software and firmware. The operation of the
   machine is validated and the performance of the system is quantified for
   the mechanical properties (peak load) and weld width of linear low
   density polyethylene (LLDPE) lap welds manufactured with the system as a
   function of linear energy density. The results provide incident laser
   power and machine parameters that enable both dual (two layers) and
   multilayer (three layers while welding only two sheets) polymer welded
   systems. The application of these parameter sets provides users of the
   open source laser polymer welder with the fundamental requirements to
   produce mechanically stable LLDPE multi-layer welded products, such as
   heat exchangers.}},

   allow novices from their early steps in the maker's world to create
   their own digital objects connected to the cloud, easily defining custom

Abstract = {{The commercial data acquisition systems used for seismic exploration are
   usually expensive equipment. In this work, a low cost data acquisition
   system (Geophonino) has been developed for recording seismic signals
   from a vertical geophone. The signal goes first through an
   instrumentation amplifier, INA155, which is suitable for low amplitude
   signals like the seismic noise, and an anti-aliasing filter based on the
   MAX7404 switched-capacitor filter. After that, the amplified and
   filtered signal is digitized and processed by Arduino Due and registered
   in an SD memory card. Geophonino is configured for continuous
   registering, where the sampling frequency, the amplitude gain and the
   registering time are user-defined. The complete prototype is an open
   source and open hardware system. It has been tested by comparing the
   registered signals with the ones obtained through different commercial
   data recording systems and different kind of geophones. The obtained
   results show good correlation between the tested measurements,
   presenting Geophonino as a low-cost alternative system for seismic data
   recording. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present the results of a feasibility study of an earthquake early
   warning system (EEWS) for the Campania region (southern Italy) using
   schools as specific targets. The study considered the seismogenic zones
   as sources of potential earthquakes for the area, the Italian
   accelerometric network as the recording network for seismic event
   occurrence, and the performances of the software platform PRESTo (Plus)
   for data analysis and processing. We analyze the distribution of
   lead-times for all possible threatening seismic sources for each
   municipality in the region under study by extracting the lead-time value
   corresponding to the 5th, 10th and 25th percentiles of the
   distributions. We discuss the results for the 5th percentile in order to
   analyze the worst-case scenario: in the case of a single site, the
   lead-time is expected to be larger than this value in the 95 \% of the
   cases. Since the population distribution in Campania is uneven and most
   of the people live nearby the coast, whilst the most destructive
   earthquakes occur along the Apennine chain, we can conclude that an
   efficient EEWS can allow most of the schools in the area to undertake
   some mitigating actions. The testing of the EEWS was carried out in the
   high school ITIS `E. Majorana', located at Somma Vesuviana, about 80 km
   from the seismogenic Irpinia region. For this purpose, the Sentinel, an
   actuator made up of low-cost hardware (i.e., Arduino(A (R))), was
   developed in close cooperation with students and teachers of the school
   to receive alert messages from the PRESTo (Plus) platform and warn the
   school users in case of a seismic event. The EEWS and the Sentinel were
   successfully tested during some blind drills performed during normal
   school activities.}},

Abstract = {{Cross-sectional analysis is one of the important areas for physical
   failure analysis. Focus Ion Beam (FIB) and mechanical polish sample
   preparation are commonly used and necessary techniques in the
   semiconductor industry and Failure Analysis (FA) Company (Wills and
   Perungulam, 2007). However, each technique has its own limitation.
   Mechanical polishing technique easily induces artifact by mechanical
   force, especially on advance technology node. FIB can eliminate
   mechanically damaged artifact, but have the limitation on
   cross-sectional view area. Another potential technique will be plasma
   FIB, it used very high milling current and fast milling speed (Hrncir et
   al., 2013). However, it comes with a very high cost and having the
   contamination issue. The contamination issue greatly affects the low kV
   Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) imaging quality. In recent
   semiconductor industry FA, low kV SEM imaging is preferable, because
   high kV imaging will introduce delamination artifacts especially on
   organic material from packaged sample. In this paper, Fast Laser
   Deprocessing Techniques (FLDT) application is further enhanced on large
   area cross-sectional FA with fast cycle time and low-cost equipment.
   This is to prevent from mechanical damage. In short, the proposed FLDT
   is a cost-effective and quick way to deprocess a sample for defect
   identification in cross-sectional FA. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The miniaturization, sophistication, proliferation, and accessibility of
   technologies are enabling the capture of more and previously
   inaccessible phenomena in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, more
   information has not translated into a greater understanding of disease
   complexity to satisfy diagnostic and therapeutic needs. Challenges
   include noncompatible technology platforms, the need for wide-scale and
   long-term deployment of sensor technology (among vulnerable elderly
   patients in particular), and the gap between the big data acquired with
   sensitive measurement technologies and their limited clinical
   application. Major opportunities could be realized if new technologies
   are developed as part of open-source and/or open-hardware platforms that
   enable multichannel data capture sensitive to the broad range of motor
   and nonmotor problems that characterize PD and are adaptable into
   self-adjusting, individualized treatment delivery systems. The
   International Parkinson and Movement Disorders Society Task Force on
   Technology is entrusted to convene engineers, clinicians, researchers,
   and patients to promote the development of integrated measurement and
   closed-loop therapeutic systems with high patient adherence that also
   serve to (1) encourage the adoption of clinico-pathophysiologic
   phenotyping and early detection of critical disease milestones, (2)
   enhance the tailoring of symptomatic therapy, (3) improve subgroup
   targeting of patients for future testing of disease-modifying
   treatments, and (4) identify objective biomarkers to improve the
   longitudinal tracking of impairments in clinical care and research. This
   article summarizes the work carried out by the task force toward
   identifying challenges and opportunities in the development of
   technologies with potential for improving the clinical management and
   the quality of life of individuals with PD. (c) 2016 International

Abstract = {{The maker movement has shown how off-the-shelf devices can be combined
   to perform operations that, until recently, required expensive
   specialized equipment. Applying this philosophy to microfluidic devices
   can play a fundamental role in disseminating these technologies outside
   specialist labs and into industrial use. Here we show how nanoliter
   droplets can be manipulated using a commercial DVD writer, interfaced
   with an Arduino electronic controller. We couple the optical setup with
   a droplet generation and manipulation device based on the ``confinement
   gradients{''} approach. This device uses regions of different depths to
   generate and transport the droplets, which further simplifies the
   operation and reduces the need for precise flow control. The use of
   robust consumer electronics, combined with open source hardware, leads
   to a great reduction in the price of the device, as well as its
   footprint, without reducing its performance compared with the laboratory
   setup.}},

Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON PRIVACY AND SECURITY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{19}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{We introduce a novel biometric based on distinctive eye movement
   patterns. The biometric consists of 20 features that allow us to
   reliably distinguish users based on differences in these patterns. We
   leverage this distinguishing power along with the ability to gauge the
   users' task familiarity, that is, level of knowledge, to address insider
   threats. In a controlled experiment, we test how both time and task
   familiarity influence eye movements and feature stability, and how
   different subsets of features affect the classifier performance. These
   feature subsets can be used to tailor the eye movement biometric to
   different authentication methods and threat models. Our results show
   that eye movement biometrics support reliable and stable continuous
   authentication of users. We investigate different approaches in which an
   attacker could attempt to use inside knowledge to mimic the legitimate
   user. Our results show that while this advance knowledge is measurable,
   it does not increase the likelihood of successful impersonation. In
   order to determine the time stability of our features, we repeat the
   experiment twice within 2 weeks. The results indicate that we can
   reliably authenticate users over the entire period. We show that lower
   sampling rates provided by low-cost hardware pose a challenge, but that
   reliable authentication is possible even at the rate of 50Hz commonly
   available with consumer-level devices. In a second set of experiments,
   we evaluate how our authentication system performs across a variety of
   real-world tasks, including reading, writing, and web browsing. We
   discuss the advantages and limitations of our approach in detail and
   give practical insights on the use of this biometric in a real-world
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless Sensor and Actuators Networks (WSANs) constitute one of the
   most challenging technologies with tremendous socio-economic impact for
   the next decade. Functionally and energy optimized hardware systems and
   development tools maybe is the most critical facet of this technology
   for the achievement of such prospects. Especially, in the area of
   agriculture, where the hostile operating environment comes to add to the
   general technological and technical issues, reliable and robust WSAN
   systems are mandatory. This paper focuses on the hardware design
   architectures of the WSANs for real-world agricultural applications. It
   presents the available alternatives in hardware design and identifies
   their difficulties and problems for real-life implementations. The paper
   introduces SensoTube, a new WSAN hardware architecture, which is
   proposed as a solution to the various existing design constraints of
   WSANs. The establishment of the proposed architecture is based, firstly
   on an abstraction approach in the functional requirements context, and
   secondly, on the standardization of the subsystems connectivity, in
   order to allow for an open, expandable, flexible, reconfigurable, energy
   optimized, reliable and robust hardware system. The SensoTube
   implementation reference model together with its encapsulation design
   and installation are analyzed and presented in details. Furthermore, as
   a proof of concept, certain use cases have been studied in order to
   demonstrate the benefits of migrating existing designs based on the
   available open-source hardware platforms to SensoTube architecture.}},

Abstract = {{3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, is the
   computer-guided process of fabricating physical objects by depositing
   successive layers of material. It has transformed manufacturing across
   virtually every industry, bringing about incredible advances in research
   and medicine. The rapidly growing consumer market now includes
   convenient and affordable desktop 3D printers. These are being used in
   the laboratory to create custom 3D-printed equipment, and a growing
   community of designers are contributing open-source, cost-effective
   innovations that can be used by both professionals and enthusiasts. User
   stories from investigators at the National Institutes of Health and the
   biomedical research community demonstrate the power of 3D printing to
   save valuable time and funding. While adoption of 3D printing has been
   slow in the biosciences to date, the potential is vast. The market
   predicts that within several years, 3D printers could be commonplace
   within the home; with so many practical uses for 3D printing, we
   anticipate that the technology will also play an increasingly important
   role in the laboratory.

Abstract = {{The open-source release of self-replicating rapid prototypers (RepRaps)
   has created a rich opportunity for low-cost distributed digital
   fabrication of complex 3-D objects such as scientific equipment. For
   example, 3-D printable reactionware devices offer the opportunity to
   combine open hardware microfluidic handling with lab-on-a-chip
   reactionware to radically reduce costs and increase the number and
   complexity of microfluidic applications. To further drive down the cost
   while improving the performance of lab-on-a-chip paper-based
   microfluidic prototyping, this study reports on the development of a
   RepRap upgrade capable of converting a Prusa Mendel RepRap into a wax
   3-D printer for paper-based microfluidic applications. An open-source
   hardware approach is used to demonstrate a 3-D printable upgrade for the
   3-D printer, which combines a heated syringe pump with the
   RepRap/Arduino 3-D control. The bill of materials, designs, basic
   assembly, and use instructions are provided, along with a completely
   free and open-source software tool chain. The open-source hardware
   device described here accelerates the potential of the nascent field of
   electrochemical detection combined with paper-based microfluidics by
   dropping the marginal cost of prototyping to nearly zero while
   accelerating the turnover between paper-based microfluidic designs.}},

Abstract = {{Additive manufacturing with 3-D printers may be a key technology enabler
   for entrepreneurs seeking to use disruptive innovations such as business

   much of the traditional supply chain. Although many expect 3-D printing
   to take off at the household level and previous work has shown
   significant returns for those choosing to do so, there are still
   significant barriers to entry for typical consumers. Our analysis
   demonstrates that for an individual to make an abnormally high return on
   their investments in 3-D printers, they must serve others to achieve
   high utilization rates. The impetus to do so is created by a service
   that can undercut traditionally manufactured products due to
   affordability and customizability. Low-cost, open-source 3-D printers
   are now priced within range of individual entrepreneurs who can take
   advantage of the long tail of consumers with highly varied interests.
   The margin advantage, net present value, and return on investment (ROI)
   analysis provided herein could form the basis of thousands of new
   small-business ventures in the coming years.}},

Abstract = {{Direct-conversion radio (DCR) receivers can offer highly integrated
   low-cost hardware solutions for spectrum sensing in cognitive radio (CR)
   systems. However, the DCR receivers are susceptible to radio frequency
   (RF) impairments, such as in-phase and quadrature-phase imbalance,
   low-noise amplifier nonlinearities, and phase noise, which limit the
   spectrum sensing capabilities. In this paper, we investigate the joint
   effects of RF impairments on energy detection-based spectrum sensing for
   CR systems in multi-channel environments. In particular, we provide the
   novel closed-form expressions for the evaluation of the detection and
   false alarm probabilities, assuming Rayleigh fading. Furthermore, we
   extend the analysis to the case of CR networks with cooperative sensing,
   where the secondary users suffer from different levels of RF
   imperfections, considering both scenarios of error free and imperfect
   reporting channel. Numerical and simulation results demonstrate the
   accuracy of the analysis as well as the detrimental effects of RF
   imperfections on the spectrum sensing performance, which bring
   significant losses in the spectrum utilization.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{JUN 16}},
Abstract = {{Cervical spinal cord injury can disrupt connections between the brain
   respiratory network and the respiratory muscles which can lead to
   partial or complete loss of ventilatory control and require ventilatory
   assistance. Unlike current open-loop technology, a closed-loop
   diaphragmatic pacing system could overcome the drawbacks of manual
   titration as well as respond to changing ventilation requirements. We
   present an original bio-inspired assistive technology for real-time
   ventilation assistance, implemented in a digital configurable Field
   Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The bio-inspired controller, which is a
   spiking neural network (SNN) inspired by the medullary respiratory
   network, is as robust as a classic controller while having a flexible,
   low-power and low-cost hardware design. The system was simulated in
   MATLAB with FPGA-specific constraints and tested with a computational
   model of rat breathing; the model reproduced experimentally collected
   respiratory data in eupneic animals. The open-loop version of the
   bio-inspired controller was implemented on the FPGA. Electrical test
   bench characterizations confirmed the system functionality. Open and
   closed-loop paradigm simulations were simulated to test the FPGA system
   real-time behavior using the rat computational model. The closed-loop
   system monitors breathing and changes in respiratory demands to drive
   diaphragmatic stimulation. The simulated results inform future acute
   animal experiments and constitute the first step toward the development
   of a neuromorphic, adaptive, compact, low-power, implantable device. The
   bio-inspired hardware design optimizes the FPGA resource and time costs
   while harnessing the computational power of spike-based neuromorphic
   hardware. Its real-time feature makes it suitable for in vivo
   applications.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{The paper describes the strategy adopted to assess the structural
   condition of the tallest historic tower in Mantua (Italy) after the
   Italian seismic sequence of May-June 2012 and exemplifies the
   application of health monitoring using (automated) operational modal
   analysis. The post-earthquake survey (including extensive visual
   inspection, historic and documentary research, non-destructive (ND)
   material testing, and ambient vibration tests) highlighted the poor
   state of preservation of the upper part of the tower; subsequently, a
   dynamic monitoring system (consisting of a few accelerometers and one
   temperature sensor) was installed in the building to address the
   preservation of the historic structure, and automated modal
   identification was continuously performed. Despite the low levels of
   vibration that existed in operational conditions, the analysis of data
   collected over a period of about 15 months allowed to assess and model
   the effects of changing temperature on modal frequencies and to detect
   the occurrence of abnormal behavior and damage under the changing
   environment. The monitoring results demonstrate the potential key role
   of vibration-based structural health monitoring, implemented through
   low-cost hardware solutions and appropriate software tools, in the
   preventive conservation and the condition-based maintenance of historic

   based on metasurface}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Real-time high-resolution (including super-resolution) imaging with
   low-cost hardware is a long sought-after goal in various imaging
   applications. Here, we propose broadband single-shot and single-sensor
   high-/super-resolution imaging by using a spatio-temporal dispersive
   metasurface and an imaging reconstruction algorithm. The metasurface
   with spatio-temporal dispersive property ensures the feasibility of the
   single-shot and single-sensor imager for super-and high-resolution
   imaging, since it can convert efficiently the detailed spatial
   information of the probed object into one-dimensional time- or
   frequency-dependent signal acquired by a single sensor fixed in the
   far-field region. The imaging quality can be improved by applying a
   feature-enhanced reconstruction algorithm in post-processing, and the
   desired imaging resolution is related to the distance between the object
   and metasurface. When the object is placed in the vicinity of the
   metasurface, the super-resolution imaging can be realized. The proposed
   imaging methodology provides a unique means to perform real-time data
   acquisition, high-/super-resolution images without employing expensive
   hardware (e.g. mechanical scanner, antenna array, etc.). We expect that
   this methodology could make potential breakthroughs in the areas of
   microwave, terahertz, optical, and even ultrasound imaging.}},

Title = {{Accessible bioprinting: adaptation of a low-cost 3D-printer for precise
   cell placement and stem cell differentiation}},
Journal = {{BIOFABRICATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The precision and repeatability offered by computer-aided design and
   computer-numerically controlled techniques in biofabrication processes
   is quickly becoming an industry standard. However, many hurdles still
   exist before these techniques can be used in research laboratories for
   cellular and molecular biology applications. Extrusion-based bioprinting
   systems have been characterized by high development costs, injector
   clogging, difficulty achieving small cell number deposits, decreased
   cell viability, and altered cell function post-printing. To circumvent
   the high-price barrier to entry of conventional bioprinters, we designed
   and 3D printed components for the adaptation of an inexpensive
   `off-the-shelf' commercially available 3D printer. We also demonstrate
   via goal based computer simulations that the needle geometries of
   conventional commercially standardized, `luer-lock' syringe-needle
   systems cause many of the issues plaguing conventional bioprinters. To
   address these performance limitations we optimized flow within several
   microneedle geometries, which revealed a short tapered injector design
   with minimal cylindrical needle length was ideal to minimize cell strain
   and accretion. We then experimentally quantified these geometries using
   pulled glass microcapillary pipettes and our modified, low-cost 3D
   printer. This systems performance validated our models exhibiting:
   reduced clogging, single cell print resolution, and maintenance of cell
   viability without the use of a sacrificial vehicle. Using this system we
   show the successful printing of human induced pluripotent stem cells
   (hiPSCs) into Geltrex and note their retention of a pluripotent state 7
   d post printing. We also show embryoid body differentiation of hiPSC by
   injection into differentiation conducive environments, wherein we
   observed continuous growth, emergence of various evaginations, and
   post-printing gene expression indicative of the presence of all three
   germ layers. These data demonstrate an accessible open-source 3D
   bioprinter capable of serving the needs of any laboratory interested in
   3D cellular interactions and tissue engineering.}},

Title = {{Monoscopic photogrammetry to obtain 3D models by a mobile device: a
   method for making facial prostheses}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD \& NECK SURGERY}},

Volume = {{45}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The aim of this study is to present the development of a new
   technique to obtain 3D models using photogrammetry by a mobile device
   and free software, as a method for making digital facial impressions of
   patients with maxillofacial defects for the final purpose of 3D printing
   of facial prostheses.
   Methods: With the use of a mobile device, free software and a photo
   capture protocol, 2D captures of the anatomy of a patient with a facial
   defect were transformed into a 3D model. The resultant digital models
   were evaluated for visual and technical integrity. The technical process
   and resultant models were described and analyzed for technical and
   clinical usability.
   Results: Generating 3D models to make digital face impressions was
   possible by the use of photogrammetry with photos taken by a mobile
   device. The facial anatomy of the patient was reproduced by a {*}.3dp
   and a {*}.stl file with no major irregularities. 3D printing was
   possible.
   Conclusions: An alternative method for capturing facial anatomy is
   possible using a mobile device for the purpose of obtaining and
   designing 3D models for facial rehabilitation. Further studies must be
   realized to compare 3D modeling among different techniques and systems.
   Clinical implication: Free software and low cost equipment could be a
   feasible solution to obtain 3D models for making digital face
   impressions for maxillofacial prostheses, improving access for clinical
   centers that do not have high cost technology considered as a prior
   acquisition.}},

Abstract = {{Supporting learners affectively while carrying out stressful educational
   activities is an open research issue. It requires the appropriate
   infrastructure for recognizing emotional states and reacting accordingly
   in runtime. In this paper, we describe the open platform that we have
   implemented (named AICARP v2) to detect changes in physiological signals
   that can be associated with stressful situations, and when this happens,
   it recommends the learner to relax by delivering modulated sensorial
   support in terms of light, sound, or vibration at a relaxation breath
   rate. In this way, by taking advantage of ambient intelligence, the
   learner can perceive the recommended action without interrupting the
   learning activity (in this case, practicing the oral exam of a second
   language). The signal acquisition of the system (which combines sensors
   from Libellium e-Health platform with others integrated ad hoc) has been
   compared with a commercial system (J\&J Engineering I-330-C2), obtaining
   similar outcomes as to identifying significant changes in the
   physiological signals when the learner experiments an emotional
   reaction. However, the cost of AICARP v2 is much lower, and at the same
   time, it is open hardware and flexible and, thus, has the advantage of
   providing runtime data processing. User studies have served to evaluate
   participants' perception of the sensorial support, as well as to
   calibrate the delivery rule and to evaluate the effectiveness of the
   support provided to them.}},

Abstract = {{Smart meters are an enabling technology for many smart grid

   possibilities for smart meters with flexible hardware and computation
   features, starting from low-cost 8 bitmicro controllers up to powerful
   single board computers that can run Linux. The metering platform
   features a current transformer which allows a non-intrusive installation
   of the current measurement unit. The suggested design can switch loads,
   offers a variable sampling frequency, and provides measurement data such
   as active power, reactive and apparent power. Results indicate that
   measurement accuracy and resolution of the proposed metering platform
   are sufficient for a range of different applications and loads from a
   few watts up to 5 kW.}},

Abstract = {{The efficient modeling, simulation, and implementation of biological
   neural networks are key objectives of the neuromorphic research field,
   leading to potential applications, such as assisting the search for new
   solutions to cure brain diseases, improved performance of robots, and
   the fundamental study of neural network behavior. This brief proposes a
   modified biological Hindmarsh-Rose (HR) neuron model that is more suited
   for efficient implementation on digital platforms. Simulation results
   show that the model can reproduce the desired behaviors of the neuron.
   The proposed model is investigated, in terms of digital implementation
   feasibility and cost, targeting a low-cost hardware implementation.
   Hardware implementation on a field-programmable gate array shows that
   the modified model mimics the biological behavior of different types of
   neurons, with higher performance and considerably lower hardware
   overhead cost compared with the original HR model.}},

Abstract = {{Open reduction internal fixation of proximal humerus fractures is often
   accomplished with proximal humerus locking plates. While these plates
   have a good track record, they can become symptomatic and require
   removal once the fracture has healed. Open hardware removal is
   associated with a number of additional risks to the patient, including
   infection, scarring, nerve damage, and blood loss. In addition, the
   recovery time after open hardware removal may be prolonged, thereby
   predisposing the patient to postoperative stiffness. The purpose of this
   article is to describe a technique for removing proximal humerus locking
   plates arthroscopically. Although technically demanding, the benefits of
   this technique include smaller incisions, quicker recovery time,
   decreased risk of infection, and reduced blood loss. Arthroscopy also
   provides the surgeon with the ability to address concomitant
   intra-articular pathology at the time of surgery. Additionally, we use a
   bone-void filler to reduce the risk of fracture through stress caused by
   previous screw holes.}},

Abstract = {{Fuzzy logic control has been successfully utilized in various industrial
   applications; it is generally used in complex control systems, such as
   chemical process control. Today, most of the fuzzy logic controls are
   still implemented on expensive high-performance processors. This paper
   analyzes the effectiveness of a fuzzy logic control using a low-cost
   controller applied to a water level control system. The paper also gives
   a low-cost hardware solution and practical procedure for system
   identification and control. First, the mathematical model of the process
   was obtained with the help of Matlab. Then two methods were used to
   control the system, PI (Proportional, Integral) and fuzzy control.
   Simulation and experimental results are presented.}},

Abstract = {{The need for automated analyzers for industrial and environmental
   samples has triggered the research for new and cost-effective strategies
   of automation and control of analytical systems. The widespread
   availability of open-source hardware together with novel analytical
   methods based on pulsed flows have opened the possibility of
   implementing standalone automated analytical systems at low cost. Among
   the areas that can benefit from this approach are the analysis of
   industrial products and effluents and environmental analysis. In this
   work, a multi-pumping flow system is proposed for the determination of
   phosphorus in effluents and polluted water samples. The system employs
   photometric detection based on the formation of molybdovanadophosphoric
   acid, and the fluidic circuit is built using three solenoid micropumps.
   The detection is implemented with a low cost LED-photodiode photometric
   detection system and the whole system is controlled by an open-source
   Arduino Uno microcontroller board. The optimization of the timing to
   ensure the color development and the pumping cycle is discussed for the
   proposed implementation. Experimental results to evaluate the system
   behavior are presented verifying a linear relationship between the
   relative absorbance and the phosphorus concentrations for levels as high
   as 50 mg L-1.}},

Abstract = {{The availability of free and open source hardware designs that can be
   replicated with low-cost 3D printers provides large values to scientists
   who need highly-customized low-volume production scientific equipment.
   Digital manufacturing technologies have only recently become widespread
   and the return on investment (ROI) was not clear, so funding for open
   hardware development was historically sparse. This paper clarifies a
   method for determining an ROI for the development of scientific free and
   open source hardware (FOSH). By using an open source hardware design
   that can be manufactured digitally, the relatively minor development
   costs result in enormous ROIs for the scientific community. A case study
   is presented of a syringe pump released under open license, which
   results in ROIs for funders ranging from hundreds to thousands of
   percent after only a few months. It is clear that policies encouraging
   FOSH scientific hardware development should be adopted by organizations
   interested in maximizing return on public investments for science.}},

Abstract = {{OpenPET is an open source, modular, extendible, and high-performance
   platform suitable for multi-channel data acquisition and analysis. Due
   to the flexibility of the hardware, firmware, and software
   architectures, the platform is capable of interfacing with a wide
   variety of detector modules not only in medical imaging but also in
   homeland security applications. Analog signals from radiation detectors
   share similar characteristics-a pulse whose area is proportional to the
   deposited energy and whose leading edge is used to extract a timing
   signal. As a result, a generic design method of the platform is adopted
   for the hardware, firmware, and software architectures and
   implementations. The analog front-end is hosted on a module called a
   Detector Board, where each board can filter, combine, timestamp, and
   process multiple channels independently. The processed data is formatted
   and sent through a backplane bus to a module called Support Board, where
   1 Support Board can host up to eight Detector Board modules. The data in
   the Support Board, coming from 8 Detector Board modules, can be
   aggregated or correlated (if needed) depending on the algorithm
   implemented or runtime mode selected. It is then sent out to a computer
   workstation for further processing. The number of channels (detector
   modules), to be processed, mandates the overall OpenPET System
   Configuration, which is designed to handle up to 1,024 channels using
   16-channel Detector Boards in the Standard System Configuration and
   16,384 channels using 32-channel Detector Boards in the Large System
   Configuration.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the low cost of easy-to-use components of open-source hardware
   and software, the Internet of Things may be pervading through everything
   everywhere. The dependability of the Internet of Things is critical
   because the services will be concerned with real life. However, the
   inexpensive hardware provides limited resources for communication. In
   this paper, we present exact all-terminal reliability of the wireless
   networks of which the number of links of each node is bounded. First, we
   analyze the all-terminal reliability of the regular wireless network,
   where any two nodes are connected by a wireless link consisting of a
   pair of radio modules. The reliability polynomial is derived from the
   Tutte polynomial that is the seminal work of the algebraic graph theory.
   Second, we analyze the all-terminal reliability of the wireless network
   including the random mesh network under the assumption that if the
   module fails, all radio links connected through a radio module are cut
   off. We consider both the fault of the communication module and the
   fading of the wireless channel in the indoor channel condition. For
   improving the reliability, we also propose a fault-tolerant method
   giving redundant radio modules into each node. We also analyze
   cost-effectiveness. We also calculate the mean-time-to-failure (MTTF)
   for wireless networks. We show that the random mesh network of which
   each node includes three or more the radio-broadcast modules is more
   dependable than any other regular network of which each node comprises
   four point-to-point modules if it is the connected graph in the static
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT) has
   been shown to be efficacious for chronic tic disorders (CTDs), but
   utilization is limited by a lack of treatment providers and perceived
   financial and time burden of commuting to treatment. A promising
   alternative to in-person delivery is voice over Internet protocol
   (VoIP), allowing for remote, real-time treatment delivery to patients'
   homes. However, little is known about the effectiveness of VoIP for
   CTDs. Therefore, the present study examined the preliminary efficacy,
   feasibility, and acceptability of VoIP-delivered CBIT (CBIT-VoIP).
   Methods: Twenty youth (8-16 years) with CTDs participated in a
   randomized, waitlist-controlled pilot trial of CBIT-VoIP. The main
   outcome was pre- to post-treatment change in clinician-rated tic
   severity (Yale Global Tic Severity Scale). The secondary outcome was
   clinical responder rate (Clinical Global Impressions - Improvement
   Scale), assessed using ratings of `very much improved' or `much
   improved' indicating positive treatment response.
   Results: Intention-to-treat analyses with the last observation carried
   forward were performed. At post-treatment (10-weeks), significantly
   greater reductions in clinician-rated, (F(1,18) = 3.05, p<0.05, partial
   eta(2) = 0.15), and parent-reported tic severity, (F(1,18) = 6.37,
   p<0.05, partial eta(2) = 0.26) were found in CBIT-VoIP relative to
   waitlist. One-third (n = 4) of those in CBIT-VoIP were considered
   treatment responders. Treatment satisfaction and therapeutic alliance
   were high.
   Discussion: CBIT can be delivered via VoIP with high patient
   satisfaction, using accessible, low-cost equipment. CBIT-VoIP was
   generally feasible to implement, with some audio and visual challenges.
   Modifications to enhance treatment delivery are suggested.}},

Title = {{Computational Effective Fault Detection by Means of Signature Functions}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 7}},
Abstract = {{The paper presents a computationally effective method for fault
   detection. A system's responses are measured under healthy and ill
   conditions. These signals are used to calculate so-called signature
   functions that create a signal space. The current system's response is
   projected into this space. The signal location in this space easily
   allows to determine the fault. No classifier such as a neural network,
   hidden Markov models, etc. is required. The advantage of this proposed
   method is its efficiency, as computing projections amount to calculating
   dot products. Therefore, this method is suitable for real-time embedded
   systems due to its simplicity and undemanding processing capabilities
   which permit the use of low-cost hardware and allow rapid
   implementation. The approach performs well for systems that can be
   considered linear and stationary. The communication presents an
   application, whereby an industrial process of moulding is supervised.
   The machine is composed of forms (dies) whose alignment must be
   precisely set and maintained during the work. Typically, the process is
   stopped periodically to manually control the alignment. The applied
   algorithm allows on-line monitoring of the device by analysing the
   acceleration signal from a sensor mounted on a die. This enables to
   detect failures at an early stage thus prolonging the machine's life.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, resistive strain gages designed and fabricated in inkjet
   printing technology with three different silver nanoparticle inks are
   presented. Inks have different Ag content (15, 20 or 25. wt\%) and
   solvents (water type or organic type). Strain gages were printed on a
   50. mu m thick polyimide and 140 mu m thick PET-based substrate with
   different printer types (professional and desktop). All printed sensors
   have the same size (17. mm. x. 5. mm). To determine the change of
   resistance due to bending of the steel beam, tensile tests were
   performed up to 1500 microstrains. Due to performed cycles of loading
   and unloading of the steel beam, gauge factor and stability of the
   response of the strain gages are measured. Resistance change was
   measured with Keithley SourceMeter 2410. For acquisition of measured
   data, in-house software tool was developed. Measured gauge factors of
   the sensors are in the range between 1.07 and 2.03 (depending on a used
   ink, substrate and printer). Results of this research indicate the
   strain gages with good GF can be produced even with low-cost equipment,
   such as desktop printer EPSON C88+ and PET-based substrate.}},

Abstract = {{The deformation monitoring of structures and buildings is an important
   task field of modern engineering surveying, ensuring the standing and
   reliability of supervised objects over a long period. Several commercial
   hardware and software solutions for the realization of such monitoring
   measurements are available on the market. In addition to them, a
   research team at the University of Applied Sciences in Neubrandenburg
   (NUAS) is actively developing a software package for monitoring purposes
   in geodesy and geotechnics, which is distributed under an open source
   licence and free of charge.
   The task of managing an open source project is well-known in computer
   science, but it is fairly new in a geodetic context. This paper
   contributes to that issue by detailing applications, frameworks, and
   interfaces for the design and implementation of open hardware and
   software solutions for sensor control, sensor networks, and data
   management in automatic deformation monitoring. It will be discussed how
   the development effort of networked applications can be reduced by using

Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{A critical parameter to assess the environmental status of water bodies
   is the transparency of the water, as it is strongly affected by
   different water quality related components (such as the presence of
   phytoplankton, organic matter and sediment concentrations). One
   parameter to assess the water transparency is the diffuse attenuation
   coefficient. However, the number of subsurface irradiance measurements
   obtained with conventional instrumentation is relatively low, due to
   instrument costs and the logistic requirements to provide regular and
   autonomous observations. In recent years, the citizen science concept
   has increased the number of environmental observations, both in time and
   space. The recent technological advances in embedded systems and sensors
   also enable volunteers (citizens) to create their own devices (known as
   Do-It-Yourself or DIY technologies). In this paper, a DIY instrument to
   measure irradiance at different depths and automatically calculate the
   diffuse attenuation K-d coefficient is presented. The instrument, named
   KdUINO, is based on an encapsulated low-cost photonic sensor and Arduino
   (an open-hardware platform for the data acquisition). The whole
   instrument has been successfully operated and the data validated
   comparing the KdUINO measurements with the commercial instruments.
   Workshops have been organized with high school students to validate its
   feasibility.}},

   open source data-sharing network. The hardware is built using several
   low-cost, open-source, mass-produced components. The system
   automatically ingests data into HydroServer, a standards-based server in
   the open source hydrologic information system (HIS) created by the
   Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Sciences
   Inc. (CUAHSI). By publishing data in this way, they are discoverable
   through the geographic information system (GIS)-based CUAHSI tools,
   HydroDesktop and HydroShare. In addition, because they follow WaterML
   encoding, open hardware data stored in the HIS can be included in
   international catalog such as the global earth observation system of
   system catalog. A recipe for building the system is provided. Multiple

Abstract = {{The smart e-bike monitoring system (SEMS) is a platform for the
   real-time acquisition of usage data from electrically-assisted bikes
   (also called pedelecs or e-bikes). It is autonomous (runs off the bike
   battery), replicable (open source and open hardware), scalable
   (different fleet sizes) and modular (sensors can be added), so it can be
   used for further research and development. The system monitors location
   (global positioning system), rider control data (level of assistance)
   and other custom sensor input in real time. The SEMS data feeds an
   online interface for data analysis, for riders to view their own data
   and for sharing on social media. The basic system can be replicated by
   other researchers and can be extended with modules to explore various
   issues in e-bike research. The source code and hardware design are
   publicly available, under the General Public License, for non-commercial
   use. SEMS was implemented on 30 bikes and collected data during 10
   months of real-word trials in the UK. This study details the design and
   implementation of the hardware and software, discusses the system use
   and explores features for future design iterations. The SEMS turns
   singular e-bikes into a networked fleet and is an example of the

Abstract = {{Coral reefs hosts nearly 25\% of all marine species and provide food
   sources for half a billion people worldwide while only a very small
   percentage have been surveyed. Advances in technology and processing
   along with affordable underwater cameras and Internet availability gives
   us the possibility to provide tools and softwares to survey entire coral
   reefs. Holistic ecological analyses of corals require not only the
   community view (10s to 100s of meters), but also the single colony
   analysis as well as corallite identification. As corals are
   three-dimensional, classical approaches to determine percent cover and
   structural complexity across spatial scales are inefficient,
   time-consuming and limited to experts. Here we propose an end-to-end
   approach to estimate these parameters using low-cost equipment (GoPro,
   Canon) and freeware (123D Catch, Meshmixer and Netfabb), allowing every
   community to participate in surveys and monitoring of their coral
   ecosystem. We demonstrate our approach on 9 species of underwater
   colonies in ranging size and morphology. 3D models of underwater
   colonies, fresh samples and bleached skeletons with high quality texture
   mapping and detailed topographic morphology were produced, and Surface
   Area and Volume measurements (parameters widely used for ecological and
   coral health studies) were calculated and analysed. Moreover, we
   integrated collected sample models with micro-photogrammetry models of
   individual corallites to aid identification and colony and polyp scale
   analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Open source hardware has the potential to revolutionise the way we build
   scientific instruments; with the advent of readily available 3D
   printers, mechanical designs can now be shared, improved, and replicated
   faster and more easily than ever before. However, printed parts are
   typically plastic and often perform poorly compared to traditionally
   machined mechanisms. We have overcome many of the limitations of 3D
   printed mechanisms by exploiting the compliance of the plastic to
   produce a monolithic 3D printed flexure translation stage, capable of
   sub-micron-scale motion over a range of 8 x 8 x 4 mm. This requires
   minimal post-print clean-up and can be automated with readily available
   stepper motors. The resulting plastic composite structure is very stiff
   and exhibits remarkably low drift, moving less than 20 mu m over the
   course of a week, without temperature stabilisation. This enables us to
   construct a miniature microscope with excellent mechanical stability,
   perfect for time-lapse measurements in situ in an incubator or fume
   hood. The ease of manufacture lends itself to use in containment
   facilities where disposability is advantageous and to experiments
   requiring many microscopes in parallel. High performance mechanisms
   based on printed flexures need not be limited to microscopy, and we
   anticipate their use in other devices both within the laboratory and
   beyond. (C) 2016 Author(s).}},

Abstract = {{The PCCR (Pupil Center Corneal Reflection) method became dominant for
   finding human's diverse eye gaze directions through the research on the
   eye tracking technology that has been done for a very long period of
   time. The initial studies on the eye tracking technology were related to
   the general human interface for operating equipment and devices, then it
   has been promoted to the field of various purposes such as a market
   research in a recent study analyzing customer's behaviors. In
   particular, a real time eye gaze tracking system is most important for
   many HCI applications including stereoscopic synthesis, intend
   extraction, behavior analysis and etc. In order to make an eye gaze
   tracking system to be real time, the system must have an efficient pupil
   detection algorithm and ambience-independent image processing as well as
   reduced complexity, small size and number of circuit components. This
   paper proposes a method for getting clean images compared to the
   previous systems to reduce image processing overhead. Because it also
   helps reducing the number of image frames to be dropped during the image
   processing, the proposed method can provide a sufficient performance
   even on a low cost hardware system by reducing the transmission traffic.

Abstract = {{This paper proposes the use of OSHW to successfully penetrate the
   Internet of Things (IoT) market by using a social platform with a new
   interdisciplinary perspective rather than through the use of existing
   technical approaches. Snowball sampling was used in this study to survey
   300 people who work and have had experiences with online brand
   communities for open source hardware (OSHW) at Fab Lab Seoul. The
   findings of this study indicate that content, consumer support, user
   interface, and reward are among the five factors that trigger an online
   brand community to develop a social OSHW platform. However, this study
   also found that brand reputation was insignificant relative to
   activating a social media platform for open-source software. In
   addition, activating a social platform for OSHW can positively affect to
   the brand community's loyalty for OSHW, which means that social platform
   innovation for OSHW can help form the positive attitude necessary to
   develop and diffuse an OSHW culture in a rapidly changing ICT ecosystem.
   This can be an important strategy for OSHW business and can contribute
   to the growth of the IoT market in South Korea. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{10}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to articulate the need for an open,
   extensible robot platform to support swarm robotic research using vision
   and to propose one such platform. The platform proposed here is intended
   for research which trades smaller population size with more
   sophisticated individual robot capabilities. The validation of proposed
   swarm robotic algorithms using real-world hardware is essential, but is
   fraught with difficulty due to the expense and complexity of developing
   and maintaining multiple operational units. A number of open hardware
   platforms have been proposed, although most prioritize small size and
   low cost over advanced capabilities such as vision. We are interested in
   a number of different research directions which utilize vision as a core
   capability and find the existing open hardware platforms to be
   insufficient (and existing commercial platforms too expensive). In this
   paper we describe a set of desirable characteristics for an open,
   extensible visually-guided robot platform. We then present our solution,
   the BuPiGo (pronounced buppy-go), describing the hardware itself and a
   model developed for simulation purposes. We also present some initial
   results on using the BuPiGo for visual homing an individual navigation
   task that we hope to exploit for swarm tasks in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Machines in general and robots in particular, appeal greatly to children
   and youth. With the widespread availability of low-cost open source
   hardware and free open source software, robotics has become central to
   the promotion of STEM education in schools, and active learning at
   college/university level. With robots, children in developed countries
   gain from technological immersion, or exposure to the latest
   technologies and gadgets. Yet, developing countries like India still lag
   in the use of robots at school and even college level. In this paper, an
   innovative and low-cost educational outdoor mobile robot is developed
   for deployment by school children during volunteer trash pickup. The
   wheeled mobile robot is constructed with inexpensive commercial
   off-the-shelf components, including single board computer and
   miscellaneous sensors. It is remote controlled by children using smart
   phone app or video game controller. The robot is also equipped with air
   quality sensors to display air pollution levels to the children and
   public. The project can improve STEM education, environmental literacy
   and civic engagement among school children, while providing
   interdisciplinary service learning opportunities for college and
   university students. Results of a prototype mobile robot design,
   development, and deployment are presented to illustrate the
   effectiveness of the approach.}},

Abstract = {{Electrophysiology has recently evolved into an interactive,
   high-throughput endeavor. Recording from dozens to hundreds of
   electrodes is today routine; novel means of manipulating the system in
   real time, through electrical stimulation, optogenetics or sensory
   manipulation are allowing us to decipher neural circuit function at an
   unparalleled rate. To contribute to the wide dissemination of such
   techniques, we present an open hardware project, High-Channel Count
   Electrophysiology (HiCCE), aiming to produce low-cost, high-channel
   count (>= 128 channels) electrophysiology instrumentation capable of
   fast data acquisition rates, real-time processing and feedback
   capabilities. Our design is centered on an open standard, FPGA Mezzanine
   Card (FMC), which permits a varied choice of FPGA carrier architectures
   suited to different laboratory experimental needs. The HiCCE-128, a
   low-cost high-performance 128-channel data acquisition board for small
   voltage signals, is being introduced. It is a FMC module that can be
   operated from any FPGA carrier conforming to the FMC/VITA57 standard.
   This specialized board with a low input referred noise of about 3 mu V
   is capable of acquiring 128 channels simultaneously at 31.25 kS/s per
   channel with 16 effective bits of resolution. We present the global
   architecture and some preliminary measurement to illustrate its
   potential for electrophysiological and medical applications.}},

   We have also developed an android application running on a smart phone

   obstacle detection and prevention algorithm based on ultrasonic ranging
   sensor. For monitoring purpose we have considered only temperature and
   humidity in the present work. But there is provision to connect other
   sensors too, viz. explosive detector or nuclear radiation detector based
   on requirement. The digital one wire temperature and humidity sensors
   are mounted to monitor real time temperature and humidity of the
   surrounding medium. The data of these parameters are displayed on the
   android application running remotely. In addition to this, the car is
   capable of transmitting live streaming video through an IP based Webcam,
   which helps in remotely monitoring and controlling the movement. The
   system has a provision of storing the data and retrieving it from the
   online database for analysis. In this paper we have discussed the
   hardware design, software aspects and test results of the system.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the possibility of performing workload forensics and/or
   malware detection in microprocessors through exclusively hardware-based
   methodologies. Specifically, we first introduce a general architecture
   which a hardware-based forensics or malware detection method would need
   to follow, as well as the various processor-level information which
   could potentially be harnessed to ensure system security and/or
   integrity. In contrast to traditional forensics and/or malware detection
   methods implemented at the operating system (OS) and/or the hypervisor
   level, whose data logging and monitoring systems are vulnerable to
   spoofing attacks at the same level, moving implementation to hardware
   ensures immunity to such attacks. This work focuses on two recent
   incarnations of this general concept, illustrating the effectiveness of
   hardware-based forensics and/or malware detection. Several other recent
   methods related to this topic are also discussed. Experimental results
   corroborate that even a low-cost hardware implementation can facilitate
   highly successful forensics analysis and/or malware detection, while
   taking advantage of its innate immunity to software-based attacks.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a methodology for learning of languages programming
   using open hardware tools. It has chosen as study case, the teaching of
   Python language due to versatility, structure and robustness that this
   language provides in the design and construction of hardware and
   software elements in devices such as Arduino or Raspberry PI. However,
   this methodology can be employed in the teaching of other type of
   programming languages such as C, Java, or Dart. It has selected as
   educational framework of the methodology some sections of the model
   known as Stage Self Direct Learning (SSDL) which provides a conceptual
   base that serves as reference model allowing to build a methodology in
   which the students will be participant of their own educational process.
   In order to enhance the learning process in the students, in the
   structure of course, it has designed an e-learning course taking as
   platform to ILIAS (Integriertes Lern-, Informations-und
   Arbeitskooperations-System). It is an open source platform with some
   features such as Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM)
   resources, forums, surveys, taxonomy services, exercises and assessment.
   During the development of course, different kinds of resources were
   created and shared through this platform, these were subject to
   discussion providing a space for the exchange of ideas and experiences
   associated with the main topics of this course. The methodology
   established allowed to encourage the interest of the students in the
   learning and use of programming languages as likewise using them in the
   design of projects that require the use of open hardware resources.}},

Abstract = {{The availability of low-cost hardware such as cameras and microphones
   has fostered the development of wirelessly interconnected devices that
   are able to retrieve from the environment, in addition to scalar data,
   the audio and video streams. Transfering the large multimedia content
   while guaranteeing QoS requirements is a very challenge to solve, given
   that multimedia applications convey a large mass of data that requires
   high transmission rate and intensive treatment. Therefore, in this
   paper, we propose a Geographic Multipath Routing Protocol (GMRP) that
   satisfies the realistic characteristics of multimedia transmission in
   wireless sensor networks.
   Simulations results show a significant contribution and indicate that
   GMRP achieves lower average delay, higher packet delivery ratio and
   ensures load balancing in the network.}},

Abstract = {{A heuristic predictive line-of-sight (LOS) guidance law is introduced to
   intercept a high-speed maneuvering target. A combination of continuous
   ant colony system and tabu search optimization algorithms is proposed to
   generate the optimal predictive commands of LOS guidance law. Prediction
   is driven by the previous positions of the target to estimate the next
   positions of it. Thus, the guidance system is continually solving a
   dynamic optimization problem in order to determine the acceleration
   commands by minimizing a cost function subject to actuators saturation.
   This innovation distinguishes the proposed guidance law from the classic
   LOS guidance, described by a simple relation between the deviation from
   the LOS and the guidance commands and use only the current measurement.
   The performance of the proposed guidance law is verified by carrying out
   several simulations of three dimensional scenarios. By still requiring
   simple and low-cost hardware in the new guidance law, simulation results
   show that the proposed heuristic predictive line-of-sight guidance law
   can prepare comparable performance in the whole case studies which show
   the robustness and adaptability of the proposed scheme.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a very simple beamsteering system which can steer
   the axial beam of any arbitrarily-large circular array in 2 dimensions,
   using 3 hybrids and 3 or 4 variable phaseshifters, depending on the
   variant of the method. It is particularly suited to mm-wave arrays for
   5G backhaul links among small cells, where the nodes would typically be
   mounted on non-rigid platforms which would require a beam-alignment and
   tracking capability over some limited range in azimuth and elevation
   around the beam axis, to compensate for platform motions.
   By minimizing the number of expensive RF components irrespective of the
   array size, this technique also facilitates low cost hardware
   implementation which is particularly important for large-scale
   deployments in future 5G wireless networks.
   The method makes use of the axial radiation patterns of phase-modes,
   which are generated by an additional 4 hybrids and imposed on an
   arbitrary number of antenna elements by a simple ``pill-box{''} radial
   TEM waveguide feed structure. Phase modes have been used in past
   applications, but almost exclusively in the azimuthal plane of circular
   ring arrays, whereas the present technique employs their radiation
   patterns in the axial direction, orthogonal to the plane of the array.
   Higher-order phase modes differing in order by ``1{''} may be similarly
   combined to increase the radial steering range, e.g. for mobile
   satellite antennas.
   An adaptive beam-tracking algorithm for such beamsteerers is also

Abstract = {{The growing availability of robotic platforms and open-source software
   presents a striking opportunity for the advancement of scientific
   instrumentation. Multirotors are particularly versatile platforms which
   offer some clear advantages for marine-based research missions including
   mapping and surveying of coastal, glacial, or marine features,
   photogrammetry, remote atmospheric or water sample collection, specimen
   tracking, and rare-event monitoring. The Olin College Intelligent
   Vehicle Laboratory has been actively developing on multirotor platforms
   to autonomously perform these missions, with special focus on
   photogrammetric and breath condensate sample collection from cetaceans.
   A critical part of our work is the design of an intelligent controller
   which will allow the multirotor to land on the deck of a research vessel
   or vessel of opportunity following the completion of a mission. A
   central control computer that may be located on the vessel will call the
   multirotor to return to the research vessel's deck, which has continued
   to travel during the mission. A global positioning system (GPS) attached
   to a specialized platform on the deck of the boat provides the current
   position of the landing platform to the multirotor. Once the multirotor
   arrives above the perceived location of the landing platform, a downward
   facing camera mounted onto the vehicle is used to identify a fiducial
   element that is located on the platform. Using the fiducial element and
   known state of the vehicle, a visual surveying methodology is used to
   allow the vehicle to land accurately on the specialized landing
   platform.
   Unlike in most simulated or controlled environments, the deck of a
   vessel of opportunity can move unpredictably in 5 axes (roll, pitch,
   yaw, longitudinal, latitudinal) due to oceanic characteristics and
   weather conditions. At present, trained multirotor pilots are the
   standard for controlling air vehicles, especially under these
   conditions. The scalability, risk, and cost of using a highly skilled
   human pilot limits the usefulness of these platforms in large-scale
   research missions. We are aiming to minimize the cost and risk
   associated with these platforms by making them accessible to untrained
   pilots as well as allowing for use of multiple platforms at one time and
   allowing for easy design of missions that the vehicle can conduct
   semi-supervised.
   Beyond obvious physical changes to the multirotor, including reinforcing
   structures or waterproofing, the multirotor itself must behave
   adaptively and sensitively to its environment. Our multirotors are
   equipped with the open hardware/software PixHawk autopilot system, which
   automatically rejects small environmental disturbances and provides
   telemetry data, such as GPS position and state of the vehicle which we
   use for our controller. A camera mounted to a stabilizing gimbal at the
   nose of the multirotor captures HD images, and a wireless video link
   transmits these images and the data from the autopilot to the
   vessel-mounted computer for processing. Our landing platform is also
   equipped with a GPS and streams information to the central computer.
   Two types of error are calculated by the computer: macro-error and
   micro-error. Macro-error refers to the gross positions of the landing
   platform and the vehicle using GPS signals. Microerror refers to the
   position of the vehicle in reference to the position of the landing
   platform fiducial element. These are used to determine the appropriate
   thrust and directional vectors to give to the vehicle to make a
   successful landing.
   In Spring of 2016, we implemented successful fiducial identification
   using computer vision techniques which extract vehicle state and image
   information to determine relative location of the vehicle to a known
   fiducial. Using this, we have developed a preliminary controller which
   allows for station-keeping of the vehicle above an identified fiducial
   on the ground. In the Summer of 2016, we will continue to develop the
   control scheme for fiducial identification, vehicle navigation, and
   landing procedure through field tests at locations including Buzzards
   Bay, Lake Waban, and the Gloucester Harbor.
   Our technology depends upon, and is itself, open-source. This allows for
   rapid iteration of controller design and means that what we develop can
   be made widely available to the marineresearch community for immediate
   use or customization. By putting these powerful tools in the hands of
   marine researchers, the need for completing missions manually can be
   eliminated. Landing on a vessel of opportunity is a significant step
   towards fully autonomous aerial instrumentation for marine-based
   research.}},

Abstract = {{High-throughput ADN sequencing technologies, also known as Next
   Generation Sequencing (NGS), have a huge impact in the development of
   bioinformatic tools. NGS generate massive amounts of data that support
   biomedical research, and assessing the quality of these data is a
   crucial task but also an important computational challenge. In the last
   ten years Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) have emerged as one of the
   major paradigms for solving complex problems using parallel computing
   techniques on commodity hardware. This paper presents Sodium, a high
   performance tool that efficiently evaluates the quality of NGS data
   using GPUs. Our experimental evaluation, performed on low-cost hardware,
   shows promising results. In particular, we observe acceleration values
   of up to 2 digits when our proposal is compared with FastQC, one of the
   most popular tools to evaluate the quality of NGS sequences.}},

   management decisions include information from data collected about the
   crops health development, which need to be gathered in a timely basis.
   There are several means of obtaining information about the plants
   health, including manual data collection from sensors installed in the
   soil and/or its vicinity, mobile sensor systems, for example embedded
   sensors in UAVs, or aircrafts, or other vehicles, and satellite imagery,
   to name just a few examples. The adoption of UAVs in such applications
   has gaining a lot of attention in recent years due to ease of access,
   low cost and available flight control software. UAV systems may carry
   several sensors, which include RGB, infrared, multispectral and
   hyper-spectral cameras. These cameras are respectively more powerful, in
   terms of data quality, as well as more expensive. The current paper
   contribution include the platform model, design and characterization of
   a multispectral camera system made from two low cost, commercial of the
   shelf cameras that can be integrated in a small UAV. These
   aforementioned cameras are compatible with open source hardware, namely

Abstract = {{Security protocols based on elliptic curves are gradually becoming the
   standard for a wide range of applications. However, the intensive
   mathematical computations involved in elliptic curve cryptography (ECC),
   create performance bottlenecks for a number of applications involving
   web servers, cloud computing infrastructures, and data centers.
   Side-by-side, software implementations of ECC are plagued with several
   implementation specific attacks. Reconfigurable hardware accelerators
   for ECC can solve both these problems. It can provide the necessary
   speeds to match the performance requirements of the applications, and
   can also provide an isolated environment, which can prevent several
   known attacks. In this paper, we demonstrate a reconfigurable hardware
   accelerator for OpenSSL's implementation of ECC, and show how a low cost
   hardware platform is sufficient to double performance.}},

Abstract = {{Innovative and quality education for all is a major precondition for
   smart nations. Children and youth are fascinated by mechanisms, machines
   and robots. Therefore, robotics using inexpensive open source hardware
   and software is increasingly being used in innovative STEM education.
   But, developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America are well
   behind the curve in the use of robots in schools and colleges. An
   innovative and extremely affordable robotic system is developed in this
   paper, whereby school children anywhere can go online and race multiple
   indoor mobile robots over the Internet. Virtual reality and force
   feedback are used to make the racing realistic and interactive. Children
   will be introduced to building their own inexpensive mobile robots using
   commercial, off-the-shelf components and materials. Advanced learners,
   e.g., college and university students, can modify and improve the
   hardware and software for Internet-based teleoperation. The project can
   be used to introduce or improve robotics education at a low cost among
   school children, while providing opportunities in service learning for
   college/university students.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is focused in the inclusion of open software tools and
   standard hardware devices into advanced mobility aids. Its urgency is
   due to the incorporation need of the numerous advances in mobile
   robotics to the area of the Assistive Technologies, and more
   specifically in the field of the so called Intelligent Wheelchairs (IW).
   In this paper we propose a common core for IWs based both on an open
   robotic platform and an open and a well extended software for robotics
   (ROS ``Robotic Operating System{''}). Such an IW core has got a
   distributed architecture whose processing nodes are linked through a CAN
   standard bus, which connects the low level control functions based on
   low cost and highly portable Cortex platforms. This paper describes also
   the autonomous navigation algorithm developed for the Intelligent
   Wheelchair by using an Extended Kalman Filter. In the chosen approach
   the absolute position of the IW (a mobile robot) is estimated using
   sensor fusion which combines data from two of the sensory systems
   included in the described open platform: the dead-reckoning system and a
   visual system based on QR landmarks located on the ceiling. Within this
   context, the paper demonstrates the potential of the platform proposal
   in relation to the quick and easy incorporation of recent advances in
   mobile robotics.}},

Abstract = {{Having a shared and accurate sense of time is critical to distributed
   Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the Internet of Things (IoT). Thanks to
   decades of research in clock technologies and synchronization protocols,
   it is now possible to measure and synchronize time across distributed
   systems with unprecedented accuracy. However, applications have not
   benefited to the same extent due to limitations of the system services
   that help manage time, and hardware-OS and OS-application interfaces
   through which timing information flows to the application. Due to the
   importance of time awareness in a broad range of emerging applications,
   running on commodity platforms and operating systems, it is imperative
   to rethink how time is handled across the system stack. We advocate the
   adoption of a holistic notion of Quality of Time (QoT) that captures
   metrics such as resolution, accuracy, and stability. Building on this
   notion we propose an architecture in which the local perception of time
   is a controllable operating system primitive with observable
   uncertainty, and where time synchronization balances applications'
   timing demands with system resources such as energy and bandwidth. Our
   architecture features an expressive application programming interface
   that is centered around the abstraction of a timeline -a virtual
   temporal coordinate frame that is defined by an application to provide
   its components with a shared sense of time, with a desired accuracy and
   resolution. The timeline abstraction enables developers to easily write
   applications whose activities are choreographed across time and space.
   Leveraging open source hardware and software components, we have
   implemented an initial Linux realization of the proposed timeline-driven
   QoT stack on a standard embedded computing platform. Results from its
   evaluation are also presented.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose an on-line system that discovers and drives
   collision-free traversable paths, using a variational approach to dense
   stereo vision. Our system is light weight, can be run on low cost
   hardware and is remarkably quick to predict the semantics. In addition
   to the scene's path affordance it yields a segmentation of the local
   scene as a composite of distinctive labels - e.g, ground, sky, obstacles
   and vegetation. To estimate the labels, we combine a very fast and light
   weight (shallow) image classifier which considers informative feature
   channels derived from colour images and dense depth maps estimates.
   Unlike other approaches, we do not use local descriptors around pixel
   features. Instead, we encompass label-predicted probabilities with a
   variational approach for image segmentation. Akin to dense depth map
   estimation, we obtain semantically segmented images by means of convex
   regularisation. We show how our system can rapidly obtain the required
   semantics and paths at VGA resolution. Extensive experiments on the
   KITTI dataset support the robustness of our system to derive
   collision-free local routes. An accompanied video supports the
   robustness of the system at live execution in an outdoor experiment.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel approach to noninvasive biometric maternity
   verification and baby-switching prevention in maternity wards based on
   dual biometric fingerprint scanner. The proposed system is expected to
   solve issues that have occurred in many countries regarding stealing or
   mixing the identities of newborn babies. The solution is based on a
   device that acquires biometric samples from the mother and her newborn
   baby right after birth and generates the unique reference of the pair.
   The same device is used to verify the bound of biometric samples before
   the mother and the baby are allowed to leave the maternity ward. The
   privacy of stored templates is provided by cancelable biometrics while
   the auxiliary data are secured with strong cryptographic protection. The
   main contribution of the proposed approach is a very high level of proof
   of maternity for each newborn baby, as well as, the prevention of
   replacing identities of newborn babies in maternity wards, with a system
   that can be realized via low cost hardware.}},

Abstract = {{Weather information is relevant to people's life, but also directly
   affects the development of all walks of life. So, how to quickly
   effective monitoring meteorological information is an important research
   aspect of contemporary society in the development of science and

   platform as the core digital processor. It used temperature \& humidity
   sensor and atmospheric pressure sensor to collect environmental
   temperature and humidity and air pressure elevation information, and can
   get the current date and time by the clock module. This system can not
   only display the detection environment information on the LCD module,
   and can through the wireless module upload this information to PC. The
   whole system has the characteristic, of low cost, lower power
   consumption and higher collection speed. It not only can be used to
   detect stable family environment, can also be used in complex

Abstract = {{The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) vision relies on reliable
   low-power wireless technologies and a complete standardized protocol

   Currently IEEE802.15.4-2015 TSCH provides reliability over low-power
   wireless technologies and the IETF has defined a protocol stack that is
   suitable to constrained devices. Open-source initiatives contributing to
   the development of network stacks for embedded devices, and the
   availability of open hardware platforms that facilitate prototyping IIoT
   applications contributes to the adoption of IIoT technologies.
   To realize the IIoT vision, this demo presents the Open-WSN and OpenMote
   projects, which provide both an open-source software implementation of
   the IEEE low-power wireless technologies and the IETF protocol stack,

Abstract = {{In the era of rapid development of ``green energy{''} and storage
   devices, microgrids implemented in line with the concept of distributed
   generation can be an effective form of power management. There is a need
   for an efficient, optimal and reliable control of the combined
   infrastructure. The article presents a flexible, configurable
   microgrid's resources control system, which executes the task of meeting
   the electricity demand of local households with regard to economic
   issues. The system developed by the authors varies from the typical
   solutions available on the market - each user integrates its resources
   with the microgrid for personal gain. A decentralized control structure
   using controllers located in each household, built on open code
   optimizers and low-cost hardware was developed. In order to minimize the
   chances of a failure, a solution redundant in the aspects of
   communication and hot standby control devices was developed. A
   configurable optimization task, which takes into account settlement
   system between participants, as well as the possible need for withdrawal
   of the device, e.g. due to damage was defined. A comprehensive
   verification was done, using simulations for the sample microgrid with
   different ways of generating and storing.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we study the assembly of chips with copper pillars and

   self-alignment of micro optics and photonic chips. Different flux and
   fluxless processes of assembly arc studied and we compare the yield,
   cleanliness and the quality of the metallic joint. The latter is
   evaluated by observation of cross sections and by shear strength
   measurement. During this work, we developed a fluxless method of
   assembly for self alignment of photonic devices which uses a
   pre-treatment step in order to improve wettability. Compared to other
   fluxless processes (formic acid, plasma, vacuum ultra violet), the
   method developed only requires low cost equipment and performs more
   efficiently than formic acid in term of wettability for SnAg bumps onto
   Au pads. We discuss the potential consequences of the different
   processes on the self-alignment for optical chips.}},

Abstract = {{In the era of Internet of Things (IoT), the development of Wireless
   Sensor Networks (WSN) arises different challenges. Two of the main
   issues are electromagnetic interference and the lifetime of WSN nodes.
   In this paper, we show and evaluate experimentally the relation between
   interference and energy consumption, which impacts the network lifetime.
   We present a platform based on commercially available low-cost hardware
   in order to evaluate the impact of electromagnetic interference in 2.4
   GHz ISM band on energy consumption of WSN. The energy measurements are
   obtained separately from each electronic component in the node.
   Interference and energy measurements are conducted in an anechoic
   chamber and in an office-type lab environment. X-MAC protocol is chosen
   to manage the Radio Duty Cycle of the nodes and its energy performance
   is evaluated. The energy consumption transmitter nodes is analyzed
   particularly in this work. Moreover, this energy consumption has been
   quantified and differentiated according to the number of (re-)
   transmissions carried out by the transmitter as well as the number of
   ACK packets sent by the receiver for a single packet. Finally, we use a
   model of real battery to calculate the lifetime of the node for
   operation within different interference level zones. This study lays the
   basis for further design rules of communication protocols and
   development of WSNs.}},

Abstract = {{The proliferation of ubiquitous computing has led to the development of
   various types of sensor devices for human-computer interaction (HCI).
   However, the availability of developer tools is lacking in comparison
   with the development of sensor devices. This shortcoming has been
   partially addressed by the introduction of open source hardware but it
   is difficult to develop applications using this alone. In this paper, a
   framework for sensor device application development has been illustrated
   by using a visual language and interconnections between the PC and

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new cost-effective data acquisition system using
   open-source hardware and Matlab/Simulink. The proposed data acquisition
   (DAQ) system has features that it uses the framed data protocol based on
   hex encoding, it can acquire multiple data which are not of the same
   type at different sample rates, and the system receives data through USB
   communication or serial communication. The software of the proposed
   system consists of the firmware of a microcontroller and user-defined
   Simulink function block. The firmware of a microcontroller is in the
   form of a header file, and the data acquisition can be easily achieved
   by calling a few functions defined in the header file. The developed
   user-defined Simulink block can get multiple data at different sample
   rates by configuring the GUI parameters appropriately. For
   implementation of the system, we use the Arch Max, which is the
   open-source hardware with an ARM Cortex-M4 core, and also use a
   user-defined c-code S-function of Matlab/Simulink. For the demonstration
   of the superiority of the implemented system, we compare the proposed
   system's performance with that of the data acquisition system provided
   in Matlab/Simulink Instrument Control Toolbox. Finally we illustrate how
   presented system can be actually used by applying the proposed system to
   DC motor control.}},

Abstract = {{Biologically inspired vision systems, such as convolutional networks,
   have begun to rival humans in some vision tasks. A key difference
   between such systems and the human visual system is that the latter
   dedicates most of its resources to a small fraction of the visual field
   (the fovea), which it moves frequently and rapidly to acquire a series
   of rich representations of small parts of a scene. We are developing an
   artificial system to approximate this aspect of human vision on a robot.
   The main components are a novel foveating lens, and a novel gimbal that
   can perform rapid and precise stereo camera orientation. This paper
   focuses on the gimbal design, which we are releasing under an open
   hardware license. We expect that it will serve as both an advanced robot
   vision system, and a source of further insight into human vision.}},

   magnet brushless DC (BLDC) motors are especially appropriate for
   applications that require a high level of accuracy and performance. The
   advanced control strategies when applied into BLDC motor drive systems
   may further enhance their performance. However, these methods are
   relatively complex and computationally intensive, which may hamper the
   implementation. Fuzzy logic control algorithm has been developed in this
   investigation and embedded into a commercially available motion control
   system for the position control of BLDC motors. BLDC motor drives
   offered by PicoMotion Inc. and Motion Control Framework software
   platform have been selected for the experiments due to their
   compactness, flexibility and the open hardware and software concept they
   have been created upon. The obtained comparative results with respect to
   the built in PI control law have confirmed that the implementation of
   more advanced control strategies on inexpensive hardware and software
   platforms, nowadays available on the market for the control of BLDC
   motors, can be practically feasible and can enhance their performance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explains the design and implementation of a low cost
   Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) system. The system is designed
   using open source hardware and offthe-shelf components for a cost of
   below 8 USD. The device identification system makes use of the
   current-peak signature to uniquely identify devices turned ON at any
   instance in time. A current sensor is used at the utility service
   entrance for measuring the current drawn by the devices. The positive
   current peak data for different devices was used to obtain the devices'

Abstract = {{Power Park comprised of multiple modular microgrids exhibits advantages
   including: better control flexibility, higher scalability, higher
   reliability, etc. The energy management system (EMS) of the Power Park
   can be divided into three layers, namely, converter layer, microgrid
   module layer and Power Park layer. In order to realize system control
   objectives in different layers, Beaglebone Black (BBB) is implemented
   for both microgrid module controller and Power Park Controller. BBB is a
   low-power open-source hardware single-board computer. Different control
   algorithms are implemented in each layer to realize respective control
   objectives. In converter layer control, converter controllers are
   scheduled to operate based on local information to realize systematic
   coordination in distributed control. In microgrid module layer, BBB
   coordinates various converters based on the Field-Area Network (FAN)
   communication. Functions like secondary voltage/frequency regulation,
   contingency analysis, etc. are executed to enhance control accuracy
   within the module. In Power Park layer, Park-Area Network (PAN) is
   implemented for communication between the central controller and
   multiple module controllers. Unit Commitment (UC), Economic Dispatch
   (ED) and Optimal Power Flow (OPF) are executed to schedule the
   coordination among modules as well as power exchange with utility grid
   to realize economic optimization.}},

Abstract = {{The sign language translator is a bridge between those who comprehend
   sign languages and those who do not, which is the majority of humanity.
   However, conventional signal language translators are bulky and

   translation of the American Sign Language. The device is portable and
   can be implemented with low-cost hardware. The prototype recognizes
   gestures for the numbers 0 to 9 and the 26 English alphabets, A to Z.
   The glove experimentally achieved, based on 1080 trials, an overall
   detection accuracies of over 92 \%, which is comparable with current
   high-end counterparts. The proposed device is expected to bridge the
   communication gap between the hearing and speech impaired and members of

Abstract = {{The Neurons in the human brain continuously generate the various types
   of Brainwave frequencies which are known as Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Theta
   waves. The proposed research is intended to find out the implications
   and effects of various external parameters using a customized framework
   by using well known methods after studying brainwave responses to
   various parameters of environment. There are continuously varying
   changes in human brain waves known as affective and cognitive responses.
   There are brain wave measuring devices available which measures EEG but
   they are proprietary and come in a big system widely used by medical
   professionals. These devices are very much expensive too and don't
   provide raw data access which can be utilized for later processing. The
   EEG data can be ported too on mobile phones and there are references
   found by which it has been ported to open source mobile phones for brain
   mapping. Many communication technologies have been developed in past
   years but development of communication systems for physically disabled
   people is the need of the day. As per the UNESCO's policy for Education
   for all, every human has right to learn and learning can only be
   possible for the disabled if a person is able to communicate. m-Sense
   (mobile Sense) is basically a mobile application with a low cost
   hardware which measures brainwave parameters and takes necessary actions
   based on the developed embedded algorithms. There has been continuous
   effort in the field of Brain Computer Interface (BCI) in the past few
   years and now this is the time to give a little shift to this technology
   to integrate brain with mobile devices.
   m-Sense is basically an Android based mobile application which connects
   to the EEG Sensor TGAM Chip B3 (cube) Band which is product of
   Neuro-Bridge, Japan having one dry EEG sensor with quite good form
   factor and Bluetooth data connectivity powered by small battery. A user
   with disability can wear the EEG headset and once connected with the
   mobile device he/she can perform various basic tasks of making a voice
   call or sending a text message. The mobile application can be configured
   with auto passkey for the B3 Band Bluetooth address and can be connected
   easily wherein a user can also see the actions being taken on the mobile
   device. The user can make a call by just changing the brain wave level
   for attention or meditation and based on the preloaded encoding
   algorithm in the mobile application various alphabets or digits can be
   generated. Details for the same are discussed in first part of this
   paper. People with disabilities can also control various home appliances
   or can change TV channels with B3 Band if it is connected with Bluetooth
   enable Arduino open source platform having controlling relays. This is
   discussed in the later part of the paper.}},

Abstract = {{With the proliferation of hand-held devices in recent years, wireless
   video streaming has become an extremely popular application. Internet
   video streaming to mobile devices, however, faces several challenges,
   such as unstable connections, long latency, and high jitter. Bitrate
   adaptive streaming and video transcoding are widely used to overcome
   such problems. However, there are still several shortcomings of these
   approaches. Bitrate adaptive streaming cannot provide fine-grained
   adaptation. Moreover, video transcoding is expensive and is hard to
   apply for live streaming.
   In this work, we propose to use a low-cost video transcoding solution
   running at the wireless edge, such as home WiFi Access Points (APs).
   Instead of having expensive server-based transcoding, we designed and
   implemented a real-time video transcoding solution on a low-cost
   hardware, Raspberry Pi. By running our transcoding solution at the
   wireless edge, it can provide more agile adaptation to sudden network
   dynamics and is able to incorporate clients' feedback quickly. Our
   transcoding solution is transparent, low-cost, and scalable. Thus it
   allows broad and quick deployment in home WiFi APs (and also in cellular
   base stations). The evaluations reveal that our system enhances the
   performance of video streaming compared with other bitrate adaptive
   solutions. It provides higher video bitrates (at least 2.1x) without
   causing video stall or rebuffering.}},

Abstract = {{We developed an algorithm for automatically detecting small and poorly
   contrasted (dim) moving objects in real-time, within video sequences
   acquired through a steady infrared camera. The algorithm is suitable for
   different situations since it is independent of the background
   characteristics and of changes in illumination. Unlike other solutions,
   small objects of any size (up to single-pixel), either hotter or colder
   than the background, can be successfully detected. The algorithm is
   based on accurately estimating the background at the pixel level and
   then rejecting it. A novel approach permits background estimation to be
   robust to changes in the scene illumination and to noise, and not to be
   biased by the transit of moving objects. Care was taken in avoiding
   computationally costly procedures, in order to ensure the real-time
   performance even using low-cost hardware. The algorithm was tested on a
   dataset of 12 video sequences acquired in different conditions,
   providing promising results in terms of detection rate and false alarm
   rate, independently of background and objects characteristics. In
   addition, the detection map was produced frame by frame in real-time,
   using cheap commercial hardware. The algorithm is particularly suitable
   for applications in the fields of video-surveillance and computer
   vision. Its reliability and speed permit it to be used also in critical
   situations, like in search and rescue, defence and disaster monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to present a real time application for air
   condition systems using hand recognition and tracking. The hardware
   requirements of the system, limited by only a simple USB web cam and a
   Beagle Board, which is a compact and low cost hardware. Our approach
   uses a simple motion detection trying to eliminate unnecessary regions
   of the image and a recognition algorithm based on Haar classifiers. An
   intelligent method and a practical application for detecting four hand
   movement instructions have been proposed for air condition systems in
   smart homes using Beagle Board. The system translates the detected
   gestures into different functional inputs and interfaces to air
   conditioner. The proposed method is also intelligent because it has an
   optimized multi layered neural network which is also optimized by a
   swarm-intelligence-based global optimization algorithm, Artificial Bee
   Colony Algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Even if, the European Directive 2008/96/CE gives great emphasis to road
   Safety Inspections (SIs) as an effective tool for safety management of
   existing roads, relevant issues remain in the use of SIs as source of
   information to prioritize measures and treatment sections with the
   highest safety benefit-cost ratio. In the framework of the IASP research
   program co-financed by the European Commission in the 2007, an
   inspection procedure aimed at improving the effectiveness and the
   reliability of the methodology has been defined and a Risk Index (RI) is
   calculated as a surrogate measure of safety. After the first
   implementation in the IASP project, further developments were carried
   out to improve the quality and efficiency of the safety inspections of
   road network by using low cost equipment (GPS, Tablet, Camera) and
   specific software tools to support the inspectors' task. The paper shows
   how the procedure, developed according to the Italian practice, was
   adapted to comply with the checklists and evaluation criteria of the
   Polish guidelines. Methods for conducting Road Safety Inspections (SIs)
   in Italy and Poland are described and compared. The different hazard
   categories of the two procedures were harmonized to an equivalent risk
   score taking into account also the regional crash type distribution.
   Finally, experimental application on about 100 km of road network in
   both countries shows the applicability of the procedure and gave the
   opportunity for a comparison of frequency and severity of safety issues
   in Italian and Polish two lane rural roads.}},

   such as steering angle, throttle pressed percentage, linear
   accelerations, etc. are fused to classify driver behaviour through an
   expert system. This development has been exposed in real-traffic

   The current technology is inaccessible to smaller community groups,

   build an open-source hardware and software framework to enable
   hydroclimatic monitoring in a more cost effective manner. At present,
   several prototype system components have been designed, fabricated, and
   tested. Our design demonstrates that a complete hydroclimatic monitoring
   system can be deployed at 1/8th the cost of modern commercially
   available systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability to interface
   with existing water quality sensors, allowing stakeholders the ability
   to use instruments they may already own.}},

Abstract = {{The electrocardiographic signal (ECG) reflects the electrical behavior
   of the human heart. The ECG signal is composed by different waveforms:
   P, Q, R, S and T. The R wave is normally the easiest waveform to
   identify on the ECG. The R wave is also the component with the highest
   amplitude and its detection allows the estimation of the heart rate.
   This paper is devoted to present the design of a digital filter
   implemented on an open hardware platform called Arduino to detect the R
   wave of the ECG signal. The filter design is based on the integration of
   a smooth filter and the first order derivative. The implemented digital
   filter has been tested using different ECG signals generated by a
   patient simulator. Finally, this paper shows a positive performance of
   the implemented filter in tests related to R wave detection even in the
   presence of unwanted noise components.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents prototype implementation of low-cost, open hardware,
   static - gesture recognition system. The implemented system has three
   major components: A Glove and Sensor Unit (GSU) - consisting of a pair
   of gloves embedded with custom made, low-cost flex and contact sensors,
   a Primary Supporting Hardware (PSH) that maps change in input values
   from GSU, a Secondary Supporting Hardware (SSH) that processes the input
   values and recognizes the gesture accurately. When a gesture is signed,
   the GSU tracks the change in orientation of the fingers, which results
   in a change in voltage levels of the sensors. This change is mapped by
   the PSH and passed on to SSH which comprises of two ATmega328P
   microcontrollers, one connected to each of the glove. The two
   microcontrollers are connected in a master-slave configuration and
   communication between them is facilitated through an XBee module. The
   performance of this gesture recognition system is evaluated using a data
   set comprising of 36 unique gestures. These gestures represent a total
   of 120 gestures that include all gestures across five globally used sign
   languages. A gesture recognition engine that resides in the master
   microcontroller processes the input and identifies the gesture. The
   gesture recognition engine comprises of a two stage
   selection-elimination embedded intelligence algorithm that is used to
   enhance the system efficiency from 83.1\% to 94.5\% without any
   additional hardware. The cost of the system is USD 30, which the authors
   believe on commercialization, could be brought under USD 9.}},

Abstract = {{In resource-constrained applications, elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)
   is preferable for the property of shorter key size with comparable
   security. Binary extension fields are usually used for area-optimized
   implementations, since the complex carry-propagation logics are avoided
   over these fields. However, efficient ECC implementations over (general)
   prime fields are still challenging for low-area constraint. As a popular
   implementation platform for cryptographic algorithms, Field Programmable
   Gate Array (FPGA) attracts more and more attentions for these
   applications due to its nice properties of flexibility and short
   development cycle. In this paper, we propose a compact and efficient
   arithmetic logical unit (ALU) by highly integrating the functions of
   Montgomery modular multiplications, additions and subtractions over
   general prime fields. Then we design a low-cost hardware architecture
   for generic elliptic curve point multiplications for FPGA platforms.
   Experimental results indicate that the implementation only occupies 105
   Slices, 2 DSP blocks and 2 BRAMs in Spartan-6 FPGA. To the best of our
   knowledge, our implementation is the smallest for general prime fields
   in FPGAs.}},

Abstract = {{The deformation monitoring of structures and buildings is an important
   task field of modern engineering surveying, ensuring the standing and
   reliability of supervised objects over a long period. Several commercial
   hardware and software solutions for the realization of such monitoring
   measurements are available on the market. In addition to them, a
   research team at the Neubrandenburg University of Applied Sciences
   (NUAS) is actively developing a software package for monitoring purposes
   in geodesy and geotechnics, which is distributed under an open source
   licence and free of charge. The task of managing an open source project
   is well-known in computer science, but it is fairly new in a geodetic
   context. This paper contributes to that issue by detailing applications,
   frameworks, and interfaces for the design and implementation of open
   hardware and software solutions for sensor control, sensor networks, and
   data management in automatic deformation monitoring. It will be
   discussed how the development effort of networked applications can be
   reduced by using free programming tools, cloud computing technologies,
   and rapid prototyping methods}},

Abstract = {{To distinguish the classes of unknown data, classification is an
   important technique. If implemented on hardware these techniques provide
   more accuracy, faster response in real time predictions than any

   In this paper a cost effective implementation of a statistical
   classifier has been proposed on Raspberry Pi, an open source hardware

   applications that were evaluated with children with cerebral palsy while
   doing their therapies. Our emphasis was on providing support for the
   distension muscle exercises as they are identified as the most painful
   activities that take place in a physical therapy session. The
   application was based on a Wiimote control, connected to a personal

Abstract = {{Introducing new communication equipment or system to the Tracking and
   Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) ground segment is a complicated
   process that involves a lengthy development and test cycle. Complexity
   arises due to the presence of the variety of signaling formats,
   operation and user constraints, monitor and control parameters, and the
   requirement to ensure the new piece of ground equipment or system meets
   the functional and performance requirements for all different
   combinations of system configuration parameters and operational
   scenarios. The development cycle starts with extensive software
   simulations to establish the performance parameters of the new equipment
   or system followed by a prototyping stage. The prototype system
   undergoes a battery of tests in a laboratory environment to verify that
   it is capable of meeting the performance levels derived from the
   software simulations. Testing must be performed using simulated signals
   generated either using software or hardware. The current practice is to
   use a chain of test equipment, each piece in the chain dedicated to a
   single function. This requires manual setup between different test
   configurations and test reporting is also handled manually. This is
   costly both in terms of test hardware investment and the manpower
   involved. The options available to reduce the cost are to use either a
   software or hardware simulator that can combine multiple functions in a
   single unit. Software simulation involves generating signal files that
   can be played back repeatedly. Depending on the data rate being
   simulated, each test file can occupy several Terabytes (TBs); in
   addition, it requires a playback system which tends to be relatively
   expensive to acquire and maintain. On the other hand, with more advanced
   signal processing technology the hardware simulation can be achieved
   with low cost Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). A low cost hardware
   simulator that can support data rates up to 25 Mbps is selected for the
   simulation system. The simulator supports baseband digital data formats
   and different modulation and coding schemes used in the TDRSS. Channel
   impairments applicable for communicating with orbiting platforms and
   signal impairments generated by the TDRSS itself are also simulated by
   the system; these include stressing profiles of delay, Doppler, and
   multipath. Hardware distortions of customer platforms are simulated by a
   set of software defined distortion filters designed according to the
   user constraints specified in the Space Network user's guide. In order
   to reduce the time spent during the prototype testing phase, an
   automated test system is being developed. Simulator architecture and the
   test automation approach will be presented.}},

Abstract = {{Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) Demand Access System
   (DAS) sustainment is aimed at modernizing the existing DAS using
   low-cost hardware components as well as a more robust monitor and
   control architecture. A key part of the system is the DAS receiver,
   which supports the Pseudo Noise (PN) modulation waveforms of the TDRSS.
   The receiver in the current DAS system is a custom design that has been
   increasingly difficult to maintain, due to hardware obsolescence and a
   lack of sufficient inventory of spare units. In addition, the receivers
   suffer from performance issues, which tend to limit the customer base
   subscribing to the DAS service. The DAS sustainment effort attempts to
   rectify the performance shortfall of the current receiver and address
   hardware obsolescence by making software portability a key design goal.
   As part of the DAS sustainment effort, two low-cost receivers were
   developed: one of them based on a commercial spread-spectrum receiver
   implemented on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), and the other a
   Software Defined Radio (SDR) implemented on a server class computer. The
   two receiver prototypes underwent extensive testing in a laboratory
   environment as well as on-air testing with orbiting customers. Receiver
   design details and test results are presented. The potential usages of
   such TDRSS compatible, low cost and small footprint of receivers in
   CubeSat are discussed.}},

   membrane-based filtration that utilize open source hardware and
   software, increasing the flexibility of a system to changing performance
   requirements while simultaneously minimizing the expense in time and

Abstract = {{The expectations of point-of-care technologies (POCT) are being
   increasingly shaped by the patient-centric narrative of 135 (predictive,
   preventive, personalized, participatory, and population based) medicine.
   Shifting the focus of our healthcare system to a personalized and
   preemptive approach will depend partly on the availability of
   field-deployable measurement technologies that provide rapid biometric
   information to providers and patients. In order to respond to the
   changing healthcare paradigm and hasten the integration of emerging
   sensor materials into clinically useful point-of-care (POC) approaches,
   it is essential that the sensor materials community understand and
   appreciate the clinical context, expectations, and aspirations of the
   healthcare consumers. After reviewing the drivers of the P5 medicine
   initiative, we review the context within which the POCT will be used,
   and some of the challenges associated with delivering portable, fast
   response, and highly reliable measurement technologies that can be used
   with complex biofluids in a range of settings by a variety of users. We
   conclude by emphasizing the potential synergies of linking POCT's to the
   ``connected health{''} model which integrates mobile technologies,
   low-cost hardware, healthcare IT systems, big data analytics, and the
   Internet of Things (IoT) to connect all stakeholders for a timely
   sharing of pertinent health information necessary for timely and

Abstract = {{In order to support the remote training of Mission Critical Operators, a
   standard interface and interconnection architecture had to be developed.
   While many others have created schemes for remote operation of
   equipment, many tend to either be customized to a target hardware, lack
   the requisite security protocols, or not be scalable. We have created
   such an architecture, leveraging existing commercial or open source
   hardware and software, and creating customizations where necessary to
   integrate the parts into an entire system. The result is an experience
   that connects students with industrially relevant hardware and software
   in a manner that approximates an industrial operator involved in
   remotely troubleshooting or configuring a networked remote resource.}},

Abstract = {{Delay optimization is a today's topic. Delay is an important quality of
   service (QoS) parameter. In this paper, we present a technique that uses
   IP-addresses to encode the way a packet passes through the network
   without using a lookup table as well as a hardware accelerator to use
   this encoded information. Using this method, the time a packet that is
   delayed in the router is decreased dramatically, and the time to
   calculate the routing information is predictable. We show in simulation
   that this lookup is possible in about 5,6 ns. The worst-case execution
   time (WCET) for routing information calculation is easy to estimate and
   is constant for a given path through the network and a given router. The
   new router design will save money and power compared to common designs.}},

Abstract = {{There are some data centers that are located far from the main data
   center for ensuring continuity of company's Information Technology
   operations in case the main data center encounters a serious downtime
   especially for companies engaged to work in distributed manner to
   increase quality-of-service to their customers. Environmental downtime
   is a significant cost to organizations and makes them unable to do
   business because what happens in the data center affects everyone. In
   addition, the amount of electrical energy consumed by data center
   increases with the amount of computing power installed. One strategy of
   reducing energy consumption in data centers is to adjust the temperature
   and humidity data. Installation of physical Information Technology and
   facilities related to environment on monitoring temperature, humidity,
   power, flood, smoke, air flow, room entry is the most proactive way to
   reduce the unnecessary costs of expensive hardware replacement or
   unplanned downtime and decrease energy consumed by servers. In this
   paper, we present remote system for monitoring auxiliary data centers
   implemented using open-source hardware platforms, Arduino, Raspberry Pi,
   and the Gobetwino. The objective of collecting temperature and humidity
   data allows monitoring server's health and gets alerts if things start
   to go wrong. When the temperature hits 50 degrees C., the supervisor at
   remote headquarters would get a SMS, then take appropriate actions that
   make sense to reduce electrical costs and preserve functionality of
   servers in auxiliary data centers. The data center environmental
   monitoring represents a step forward towards addressing awareness
   monitoring of energy efficiency and data centers located far with
   ability to receive a notification by email. (C) 2016 Published by

   stakeholders in the design and deployment of digital assistive
   technology is increasingly being recognized as important. The
   Do-It-Yourself Assistive Technology (DIY-AT) approach investigates
   methodologies and tools to support accessible making practices. In prior
   work, we successfully used a DIY-AT approach to develop TalkBox, an
   open-source direct-selection communication board for those with little
   or no functional verbal communication. In this paper, we describe a
   follow-up project in which we use TalkBox as a prototyping platform to
   facilitate co-design and co-fabrication of DIY-AT. We present results
   from (1) a workshop in which users with disabilities and their
   parents/caregivers fabricated their own TalkBoxes, and (2) a
   collaborative co-design session with a nonverbal child and his mother
   wherein the potential for TalkBox variants led to novel design
   decisions. We illustrate the outcome of our process by describing the
   multi-vocabulary variant called Hot Swappable TalkBox, in which RFID
   technology is used to afford easy switching among different vocabulary
   sets.}},

   students to creatively explore haptic environments without writing code.
   To investigate haptic e-learning without user programming, we developed
   HandsOn, a conceptual model for exploratory, embodied STEM education
   software; and implemented it with the SpringSim interface and a task
   battery for high school students. In two studies, we confirm that
   low-cost devices can render haptics adequately for this purpose, find
   qualitative impact of SpringSim on student strategies and curiosity, and
   identify directions for tool improvement and extension.}},

Abstract = {{Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) are promising communication devices
   between humans and machines. BCI based on non-invasive neuroimaging
   techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG) have many applications,
   however the dissemination of the technology is limited, in part because
   of the price of the hardware. In this paper we compare side by side two
   EEG amplifiers, the consumer grade OpenBCI and the medical grade g. tec
   g. USBamp. For this purpose, we employed an original montage, based on
   the simultaneous recording of the same set of electrodes. Two set of
   recordings were performed. During the first experiment a simple adapter
   with a direct connection between the amplifiers and the electrodes was
   used. Then, in a second experiment, we attempted to discard any possible
   interference that one amplifier could cause to the other by adding
   ``ideal{''} diodes to the adapter. Both spectral and temporal features
   were tested - the former with a workload monitoring task, the latter
   with an visual P300 speller task. Overall, the results suggest that the
   OpenBCI board - or a similar solution based on the Texas Instrument
   ADS1299 chip - could be an effective alternative to traditional EEG
   devices. Even though a medical grade equipment still outperforms the
   OpenBCI, the latter gives very close EEG readings, resulting in practice
   in a classification accuracy that may be suitable for popularizing BCI
   uses.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, many services and applications need to be secured. In this
   paper we present the design and the initial development of a new
   security-oriented open hardware and software platform easy to be
   integrated and capable of hiding significant complexity behind a set of
   simple high-level APIs. This SoC platform is called SEcube (TM) (Secure
   Environment cube). It is a single-chip design that embeds three main
   cores: a highly powerful processor, a Common Criteria certified
   smartcard, and a flexible FPGA. The SEcube (TM) platform provides
   several functional entry levels, ranging from the hardware to software
   APIs amenable to become service-ready in a near future. This way,
   developers who do not feel comfortable on security aspects can use the
   easy-to-use API abstraction layer and experience the Cube as a
   high-security black box. Conversely, security experts can avail of the
   open source character, and verify, change, or write from scratch the
   entire system, starting from the elementary low-level blocks.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet of Things promises an always-connected future where the
   objects surrounding us will communicate in order to make our lives
   easier, more secure, etc. This evolution is a research opportunity as
   new solutions must be found to problems ranging from network
   interconnection to data mining. In the networking community, innovative
   solutions are being developed for the Device Layer of the Internet of
   Things, which includes the IoT wireless protocols. In order to study
   their performance, researchers turn more often to real world platforms,
   commonly designated by the term ``testbeds{''}, on which they may
   implement and test the protocols and algorithms. This is even more
   important in the Industrial IoT field, where environments are perturbed
   by industrial systems like automated production systems. In this paper,
   after a brief presentation of the context of testbeds, we introduce WiNo
   and OpenWiNo, an open hardware and software framework for
   fast-prototyping in the field of the Internet of Things. Compared to
   existing platforms, the solution WiNo+OpenWiNo offers a wide array of
   Physical layers and easy integration of various sensors as it is
   developed as part of the Arduino ecosystem. It also allows research
   teams to easily and quickly deploy their own testbed into real
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a low-cost, re-configurable Modular Intelligent Node
   for Distribution systems (MIND). It can serve as a sustainable and
   general-purpose module for monitoring and automation of power
   distribution systems. MIND is designed and built with low-cost hardware,
   interconnectivity with other modules, and highly reconfigurable design
   of hardware and software to support newly added monitoring and
   automation tasks. For tasks requiring limited computational power, MIND
   uses its local hardware, otherwise it uses the computational power of
   other MINDS within the same network or cloud services. The tests here
   show time synchronization and then application of MIND for power quality
   metering in an IEC 61850 framework. In this study, MIND is synchronized
   to the UTC time using the IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP) V2
   protocol and the RMS calculation is done according to the IEC 6100-4-30
   standard. Results show the accuracy of the time synchronization, the
   ability to track the voltage sags and swells, and the reporting latency.}},

Abstract = {{This paper compares the performance of single pseudo-noise (PN) and dual
   PN (DPN) sequences for time of arrival (ToA) estimation in underwater
   acoustic (UWA) localization. The single PN scheme uses the correlation
   of a local PN sequence and the received PN signal to estimate the ToA.
   The DPN scheme utilizes the cross correlation of the two received PN
   segments in one signal frame to calculate the ToA. Both simulation and
   field test results show that the DPN design outperforms the single PN
   scheme, as the DPN scheme is robust to the severe underwater acoustic
   channel dispersion and the high carrier frequency offset (CFO) in
   low-cost hardware systems where the atomic clock is unavailable.}},
