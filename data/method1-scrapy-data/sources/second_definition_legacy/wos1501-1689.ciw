AB The DAT Smart Home - located in Milan, Italy, within the premises of the Don Gnocchi Rehabilitation Institute - has a threefold purpose. Within the rehabilitation and Assistive Technology counselling activities of the Institute, it serves as a physical setting where clients with disabilities learn and experience how to make the most effective use of technology for their independence at home. For professionals and the general public it serves as a demonstration and educational laboratory to get knowledge of technologies for home automation and home care at distance. Within the Bioengineering Centre of the Institute, it serves as a research lab where innovative devices, sensors, applications and protocols can be tried out and further developed for home care, independence and quality of life. In order to meet these three goals the home has been designed according to a modular and flexible approach that allows for quickly configuring and customizing the technological environment according to the needed setting case by case. An open design concept has been adopted to accommodate for new devices and standards the current advancement in home automation technology is bringing about.

AB Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may be used as an alternative treatment for depressed patients who do not tolerate or respond adequately to treatment with a conventional antidepressant. This randomized, open-label, multicenter study compared the effectiveness of the SNRI venlafaxine extended release (VXR) with that of conventional antidepressants (CA) in patients who were referred to an outpatient psychiatric specialty care setting for treatment after failure to tolerate or respond to at least 4 weeks of treatment with a CA in a primary care setting. Patients with a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D-17) score >= 17 were randomly assigned to treatment with an alternative CA or VXR. Remission was defined as a score <= 7 on the HAM-D-17. Efficacy analyses were carried out on 3,097 patients from the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (1,632 VXR; 1,465 CA). The antidepressants prescribed most frequently in the CA group were paroxetine (21.3%), citalopram (20.1 %), sertraline (19.1 %), fluoxetine (17.0%), and mirtazapine (7.9%). After 24 weeks of treatment, the VXR group demonstrated a significantly higher remission rate than did the CA group (59.3% VXR; 51.5% CA; P<.0001; odds ratio: 1.37; 95% CI. 1.19-1.58; P<.01). Despite the limitations of the open design, the results of this study suggest that venlafaxine extended release may be more effective than the conventional antidepressants used in this study when treating depressed patients who do not tolerate or respond adequately to treatment with a conventional antidepressant.

AB In this paper, we describe the development of a web-enabled design platform for collaborative MEMS design. The proposed distributed module modeling and evaluation framework with a client-knowledge server architecture, KS-DMME, allows multiusers/designers in different locations to participate in the same design process. Under this framework, concurrent integrated MEMS design and simulation models can be built using both local and distributed resources, and the design collaboration can be realized by exchanging services between modules based upon a standard CORBA communication protocol. A prototype web-enabled design system, e-MEMS Designer (previously Web-MEMS Designer) is implemented through concurrent integration of multiple distributed and cooperative knowledge sources and software based on web service technologies. By use of the developed prototype system, MEMS design and simulation can be carried out in an integrated but open design environment on the web. A case study is provided for a microgripper design.

AB Aspirin is widely used for its antiplatelet activity, but it harbors a risk of severe adverse gastrointestinal effects, such as bleeding and perforation, especially in elderly people. Our aim to assess the prevalence of upper gastrointestinal lesions and the effect of aspirin on the gastrointestinal mucosa in asymptomatic subjects taking minidose aspirin (100 to 325 mg per day) for more than 3 months. A prospective, open design was used. Patients attending the ophthalmology and cardiology outpatient clinics who had a medical history of more than 3 months of regular aspirin consumption were referred for esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Of the 90 patients referred for EGD, 44 were symptomatic (epigastric pain or dyspepsia) and were excluded from the study. The 46 asymptomatic patients included 22 men and 24 women of mean age 70 10 years (range, 36 to 87 years); 32% were current or former smokers. Mean daily aspirin dose was 129.34 +/- 76.61 mg. Only 24% were taking a gastroprotective agent. EGD revealed ulcer or erosions in 47.83% of the patients: erosive gastroduodenitis in 13 patients, gastric ulcer in 14, duodenal ulcer in 2, and gastric and duodenal ulcers in 2. Urease test for Helicobacter pylori infection was positive in 26%. Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed no factor other than aspirin predictive of a positive endoscopy. Minidose aspirin treatment is associated with a high prevalence of ulcerations of the stomach and duodenum.

AB Complexity demand of modern communication systems, particularly in the wireless domain, grows at an astounding rate, a rate so high that the available complexity and even worse the design productivity required to convert algorithms into silicon are left far behind. This effect is commonly referred to as the design productivity crisis or simply the design gap. Since the design gap is predicted to widen every year, it is of utmost importance to look closer at the design flow of such communication systems in order to find improvements. While various ideas for speeding up designs have been proposed, very few have found their path into existing EDA products. This paper presents requirements for such tools and shows how an open design environment offers a solution to integrate existing EDA tools, allowing for a consistent design flow, considerably speeding up design times.

AB The open model for solutions development is quickly extending from software to other technology areas, such as hardware and services. Specifically, just as open source has spawned a revolution in the technical, business, and legal model for software, open hardware will provide a swell of collaborative innovation that will create entirely new markets and provide significant business benefits to the most creative, most reliable, and most adaptable semiconductor, EDA, System-On-Chip (SoC) and systems houses. The open-source software stack with Linux as its cornerstone is increasingly the preferred choice for newly venture-funded companies. Open hardware will also change the world of SoC venture investing. While the degree of openness and the business model may vary, SoC products have to be increasingly developed through a collaborative model that helps assemble IP blocks and services from multiple sources. In this paper we describe the open standards model for hardware, chip, and tool innovation, and we argue the a systematic IP valuation methodology will help the success of this. environment, in that it will allow each member of the value chain especially small VC-backed companies - to capture enough value to desire to participate.

AB To make the complex mechanical equipment work in good service, the technology for realizing an embedded open system is introduced systematically, including open hardware configuration, customized embedded operation system and open software structure. The ETX technology is adopted in this system, integrating the CPU main-board functions, and achieving the quick, real-time signal acquisition and intelligent data analysis with applying DSP and CPLD data acquisition card. Under the open configuration, the signal bus mode such as PCI, ISA and PC/104 can be selected and the styles of the signals can be chosen too. In addition, through customizing XPE system, adopting the EWF (Enhanced Write Filter), and realizing the open system authentically, the stability of the system is enhanced. Multi-thread and multi-task programming techniques are adopted in the software programming process. Interconnecting with the remote fault diagnosis center via the net interface, cooperative diagnosis is conducted and the intelligent degree of the fault diagnosis is improved.

AB An open condition-monitoring system combined C/S (Client/Server) with B/S (Brower/Server) pattern was introduced. It consists of three parts of software: SE (Server-Terminal), ADE ( Analysis-Diagnosis-Tenninal) and DAE (Data-Acquisition-Terminal). SE can monitor every connection request from ADE or DAE user and determinate whether ADE or DAE can be run on client's PC. As a result, the system security is improved in a sense. Additionally, the system hardware part comprises two kinds of terminal portable instruments: DASOC(data-acquisition system on chip based-on the Cygnal MCU) and DSAI(dynamic signal analysis instrument based on an embedded OS:XPE). DASOC and DSAI can realize data-acquisition, signal analysis and data-transmission based-on internet. The system structure mode has been applied to a certain power plant's enterprise information network in Tianjin. Results show that the system is successful.

AB This paper describes the fundamentals of a research project which is being launched in the emerging field of Ambient Intelligence as defined by the European Union's 6th Research Program on Information Society. Massively multi-agent systems is the natural technique for implementing Ambient Intelligence. Adaptivity is one of the key features of ambient systems. Ensuring that the evolution of an ambient system is predictable and desirable is a challenging open design issue. We propose a user-driven approach to adaptation. We call it "Adaptive Modeling" because it relies on the architectural style known as Adaptive Object-Models. This provides us with a design method and tool for agents to be used in this context. Systems built with this method allow non-programmer domain experts to locally modify the structure and behavior of agents at runtime, and thus obtain system-level adaptation. Expert-driven adaptation should ensure the appropriateness of the system's behavior with respect to its requirements. We illustrate our method with an existing multi-agent system. Work is under way for extending it with other features, notably faulttolerance, as well as "agent-driven adaptation" by replacing expert users with monitoring agents endowed with the same expertise.

AB The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) is the largest fully public repository for high-throughput molecular abundance data, primarily gene expression data. The database has a flexible and open design that allows the submission, storage and retrieval of many data types. These data include microarray-based experiments measuring the abundance of mRNA 5 genomic DNA and protein molecules, as well as nonarray-based technologies such as serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) and mass spectrometry proteomic technology. GEO currently holds over 30000 submissions representing approximately half a billion individual molecular abundance measurements, for over 100 organisms. Here, we describe recent database developments that facilitate effective mining and visualization of these data. Features are provided to examine data from both experiment and gene-centric perspectives using user-friendly Web-based interfaces accessible to those without computational or microarray-related analytical expertise.

AB A comparatively simple approach to highly parallel simulation of Petri nets on commodity, desktop PC hardware is suggested. A mapping. described in the programming language of Petri net semantics to the SIMD architecture of NVidia 5-series and 6-series GPUs is provided, and a prototype simulator is tested on both conflict-intensive and conflict-free Petri net models. In all cases, the prototype parallel simulator is seen to deliver substantial performance,gains over its serial counterparts. Limitations of the approach and open design issues are also described.

AB The study objective was to evaluate, by means of automated office and phone-transmitted home blood pressure (OBP and HBP) recordings, the effects of a fixed combination of valsartan 160 mg and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 mg in hypertensive patients previously uncontrolled with the combination of an angiotensin receptor antagonist and HCTZ. From 241 selected patients, 171 (71%) had uncontrolled hypertension OBP and HBP [mean baseline OBP and HBP systolic and diastolic (SBP/DBP): 157/91 and 152/87 mmHg]. In this open-design study, patients were directly switched from other angiotensin receptor blocker combination products to valsartan/HCTZ for 6 weeks. The same validated automated device was used for OBP and HBP recordings. At baseline, mean HBP was 152 +/- 15/87 +/- 10 mmHg and mean OBP was 157 +/- 12/91 9 mmHg. After 6 weeks of treatment with valsartan 160 mg and HCTZ 25 mg, a significant decrease in BP was observed both at home (146 +/- 17/83 +/- 12 mmHg) and at the office (151 +/- 18/87 +/- 11 mmHg), with a difference from baseline of -4 mmHg, p < 0.001 for DBP and of -6 mmHg for SBP, p < 0.001. The percentage of patients with office and home control was 24% and 23% respectively, with a kappa index at 0.459. Elevated OBP only (office hypertension) was observed in 3.6% and elevated HBP only (masked hypertension) in 10% of patients. In conclusion, treatment with valsartan and HCTZ 25 mg in patients with confirmed uncontrolled hypertension induced a clinically relevant decrease in BP with approximately 23% of additional patients strictly controlled with a single tablet. The use of an automated oscillometric device at the office and at home allowed the detection of controlled subjects with good agreement.

AB Chloasma (melasma), an acquired hypermelanosis, is often recalcitrant to various treatments and an amenable, as well as safe, pigment-reducing modality is needed. We investigated that the reducing effect of proanthocyanidin, a powerful antioxidant, on chloasma in a one-year open design study. Proanthocyanidin-rich grape seed extract (GSE) was orally administered to 12 Japanese woman candidates with chloasma for 6 months between August 2001 and January 2002 and to 11 of these 12 for 5 months between March and July 2002. Clinical observation, L* value (lightening) and melanin index, and size (length and width) measurements of chloasma were performed throughout the study period. The first 6 months of GSE intake improved or slightly improved chloasma in 10 of the 12 women (83%, p < 0.01) and following 5 months of intake improved or slightly improved chloasma in 6 of the 11 candidates (54%, p < 0.01). L* values also increased after GSE intake (57.8 +/- 2.5 at the start vs 59.3 +/- 2.3 at 6 months and 58.7 +/- 2.5 at the end of study). Melanin-index significantly decreased after 6 months of the intake (0.025 +/- 0.005 at the start vs 0.019 +/- 0.004 at 6 months) (p < 0.01), and also decreased at the end of study (0.021 +/- 0.005) (p < 0.05). GSE is effective in reducing the hyperpigmentation of women with chloasma. The beneficial effects of GSE was maximally achieved after 6 months and these was no further improvement after this period. The latter GSE intake for 5 months may prevent chloasma from becoming worse prior to the summer season. GSE is safe and useful for improving chloasma. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB As pharmacokinetics represents a bridge between pharmacological concentrations and clinical regimens, the pharmacokinetic exploration of the therapeutic dose range is a major outcome. This study was aimed at assessing pharmacokinetic linearity of i.v. vinorelbine through an open design with intra-patient dose escalation (3 doses/group). Three groups of six patients received either 20-25-30 mg/m(2); or 25-30-35 mg/m(2); or 30-35-40 mg/m(2). The inclusion criteria were: histologically confirmed tumour with at least one assessable target lesion, age 25-75 years, WHO PS less than or equal to2, normal haematology and biochemistry, life expectancy greater than or equal to3 months. The pharmacokinetics was evaluated in both whole blood and plasma over 120 h. Twenty-six patients were recruited and 18 were evaluable for pharmacokinetics. The toxicity consisted in grade less than or equal to3 leucopenia and neutropenia (<20% of courses) and two grade 4 constipation with rapid recovery (2/54 courses). Compared to blood, plasma was demonstrated to underestimate the pharmacokinetic parameters. In blood, the drug total clearance was about 0.6 l/h/kg, with minor contribution of renal clearance, steady state volume of distribution close to 13 l/h/kg, and elimination half-life at about 40 h. A pharmacokinetic linearity was demonstrated up to 40 mg/m(2), and even up to 45 mg/m(2) when pooling data from another study. A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship was evidenced on leucopenia and neutropenia when pooling the data from the two studies.

AB OBJECTIVE Adult GH deficiency (GHD) is linked to endothelial dysfunction and vascular disease. We examined the effect of 12 months of GH therapy on endothelial function, C-reactive protein (CRP) and coronary risk.
   DESIGN Open-design intervention study.
   PATIENTS Fourteen GH-deficient patients (nonsmokers, without diabetes, hypertension or vascular disease) studied before, 6 months and 12 months after GH therapy.
   MEASUREMENTS Flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) thrombomodulin (TM), E-selectin, CRP, lipid profile, blood pressure and anthropometric data were recorded. We used the Framingham equation to calculate coronary risk.
   RESULTS FMD improved (7.5 +/- 1.62 vs. 11.93 +/- 1.52, P = 0.038). Overall there was no change in IMT, TM, E-selectin or CRP. The correlation between TM and FMD showed a trend for statistical significance (r = -0.54, P = 0.056). Changes in CRP correlated with change in IGF-1 (r = -0.67, P = 0.012); E-selectin correlated with high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (r = -0.60, P = 0.028), triglycerides (r = 0.68, P = 0.01) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) (r = 0.71, P = 0.006). Systolic (127.36 +/- 4.47 vs. 120.36 +/- 3.50, P = 0.017) and diastolic (84.71 +/- 2.73 vs. 76.93 +/- 2.03, P = 0.005) blood pressure decreased. HDL-cholesterol increased (0.70 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.93 +/- 0.06, P = 0.001). WHR decreased (0.90 +/- 0.02 to 0.88 +/- 0.02, P = 0.043) without changes in weight or body mass index (BMI). Ten-year absolute (P = 0.009) and relative (P = 0.002) cardiac risk decreased.
   CONCLUSION Biophysical test of endothelial function (FMD) improved after 12 months of GH therapy but there was no significant change in biochemical endothelial or inflammatory markers. Calculated coronary risk decreased mainly due to reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and increase in HDL-cholesterol.

AB Study Design. Open design cross-sectional questionnaire.
   Objectives. The aims of this study are to determine the frequency of low back pains in the younger population and the factors that have an influence on this frequency.
   Summary of Background Data. Low back pain is one of the most important social problems that causes injuries in the younger population. Low back pain frequency is around 30% among adolescents, and 88% of those with low back pain experiences in adolescence have low back pain in later years. Therefore, identifying and, if possible, preventing the associated factors in adolescence and young adulthood is essential for the solution of this social problem.
   Methods. A total of 1,552 students from a total of 8,000 who had come from all parts of Turkey for university registration accepted to participate in the study and were given a questionnaire about low back pain experiences, disability, and possible associated factors.
   Results. Low back pain frequency was found to be 40.9%. This rate increases with age. Abandonment of moderate level physical activity and traumas such as slipping on ice and falling down the stairs were identified as associated factors.
   Conclusions. Regular physical activity and the prevention of falls might be ways for decreasing the frequency of low back pain experiences among the youth and significantly influencing the frequency of low back pain in adult population.

AB The aim of this study was to assess the effect of estrogen, two regimens of continuous combined hormone replacement therapy (HRT), tibolone and raloxifene on serum lipid, apolipoprotein A(1) and B and lipoprotein(a) levels in Greek postmenopausal women.
   A total of 350 postmenopausal women were studied in a prospective open design. Women were assigned to one of the following regimens depending on the presence of risk factors for osteoporosis, climacteric symptoms and an intact uterus: conjugated equine estrogen 0.625 mg (CEE, n = 34), continuous combined CEE 0.625 mg plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 5 mg, (n = 80), continuous combined 17beta-estradiol 2 mg plus norethisterone acetate (NETA) 1 mg (n = 58), tibolone 2.5 mg (n = 83) and raloxifene HCl 60 mg (n = 50). Forty-five postmenopausal women with no indications for HRT served as controls. Total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholestrol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), apolipoprotein A, (ApoA(1)), apolipoprotein B (ApoB) and lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) levels were assessed in each subject at baseline, and at 6 and 12 months of therapy. All therapy regimens lowered TC levels compared to baseline (4.2-8.0% decrease). This effect was more prominent in the subgoup of women with high baseline TC levels (9.1-20.4% decrease). LDL cholesterol decreased significantly in CEE, CEE/MPA and raloxifene groups (-11.2%, -11.9% and -11.0%, respectively). Hypercholesterolemic women exhibited a steeper decrease in LDL cholesterol (10.6-27.8% in all therapy groups). TG levels increased significantly in the CEE and CEE/MPA groups (23.7% and 21.8%, respectively), while estradio/NETA had no effect on TG levels. Tibolone decreased TG levels markedly, by 20.6%, while raloxifene had no TG-lowering effect. HDL cholesterol and ApoA(1) were increased by CEE and CEE/MPA (HDL cholesterol, 7.4% and 11.8%, respectively; ApoA(1), 17.8% and 7.9%, respectively) and decreased by tibolone (HDL cholesterol, -13.6%; and ApoA(1), -9.9%). All therapy regimens except raloxifene lowered Lp(a) levels, with tibolone having the more pronounced effect (-13.2 to -29.0%). In conclusion, each therapy regimen had a different effect on lipid-lipoprotein levels, exerting favorable and unfavorable modifications. Hypercholesterolemic women seemed to benefit more from the cholesterol-lowering effect of estrogen replacement therapy/HRT. The choice for a particular regimen should be based on individual needs, indications and lipid-lipoprotein profile.

AB Permanent continuous power quality monitoring is beginning to be recognized as an important aid for managing power quality. Preventive maintenance can only be initiated if such monitoring is available to detect the minor disturbances that may precede major disruptions. This paper establishes the need to encourage interoperability between power quality instruments from different vendors. It discusses the frequent problem of incompatibility between equipment that results from, the inherent inflexibilities in existing designs. A new approach has been proposed to enhance interoperability through the use of open systems in their design. It is demonstrated that it is possible to achieve such open design using existing software and networking technologies. The benefits and disadvantages to both the end-users and the equipment manufacturers are also being discussed.

AB This study examined the influence of various conflict management mechanisms embedded into computer-supported collaborative concept mapping systems on the behaviour and learning of elementary students. Four conflict management mechanisms were compared: an assign design, in which the mapping control was designated to a particular group member; a rotate design, in which the mapping control was rotated among the group members; a give design, in which the child with mapping control could relinquish control to another group member; and an open design, in which every group member simultaneously had mapping control. Ninety-six fifth and sixth grade Taiwanese students participated in this study. They were arranged into assign, rotate, give, or open three-member groups to generate collaboratively shared concept maps. Student interactions, attitudes, and achievement were analysed. The results suggest that each conflict management mechanism has a different effect on the elementary students.

AB A current focus of many instrumentation and Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) designers is the area of Synthetic Instrumentation. This instrumentation, which consists of physically separate building blocks or modules, provides the opportunity to reduce the system's overall hardware content by eliminating common hardware functionality located within each traditional instrument. This modular design provides opportunities for lower lifecycle cost, smaller physical packages and increased capabilities through module upgrades. However, the design of synthetic instrumentation and its integration into an ATE system poses technical challenges not typically seen with traditional instrumentation.
   Traditional instrument developers are now faced with the challenge of determining how their existing and future modules, for example a digitizer or waveform generator, satisfy a portion of the requirements of a synthetic instrument. ATE developers are challenged to identify the proper set of modules, primarily Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS), that together satisfy the system level requirements. In addition, they must address instrumentation concurrency, synchronization, switching, and develop a software and hardware architecture that supports future upgrades as technology advances. Each of these issues requires a strong system engineering discipline that can develop a robust system architecture.
   In 2002 SEI began a program to integrate synthetic instrumentation that provided the functionality of a spectrum analyzer, A/D converter, counter timer, UART and AVMUX into a legacy Air Force Test Station. In 2003 SEI continued with an additional program that consisted of design and development of a synthetic instrument that provided the functionality of a power meter, spectrum analyzer, frequency time interval counter, oscilloscope and digital multi meter. During each of these programs SEI worked directly with commercial instrument manufacturers, electrical designers and the military to establish the system requirements and resulting architecture. This paper will describe the key technical issues encountered while defining the system architecture including concurrency, modularity, synchronization, and maintaining an open hardware and software architecture. In addition, the resultant system architecture will be described.

AB In contrast to the effects seen in younger adults, depressed elderly subjects have shown more modest antidepressant responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). We theorized that higher stimulation intensities in older depressed subjects with prefrontal atrophy might be needed to stimulate underlying cortex. In an open design with patients on stable baseline medications, we treated 18 treatment-resistant elderly depressed subjects (mean age 61.2 +/- 7.3) with 15 rTMS sessions over 3 weeks. We adjusted the delivered TMS intensity to account for MRI measured prefrontal atrophy. The skull to prefrontal cortex distance increased with age, whereas the skull to motor cortex distance did not. All subjects tolerated the higher doses well. The average intensity used was 114% of motor threshold (MT) with a range from 103-141% MT There was an average 35% decline over the 3 weeks in HRSD scores. After 3 weeks, of treatment, 27% (5118) met response criteria (>50% improvement), with four of these five also meeting criteria for remission (exit Hamilton Depression Score <8). These initial pilot findings support the need for blinded studies using prefrontal TMS in an elderly population, testing whether TMS, delivered at stimulation intensities calculated to overcome atrophy, is more effective than TMS without adjusting for atrophy.

AB In design of high performance heatsinks, it is vital to understand how the primary constraints of volumetric footprint and hydraulic operating point limit maximum thermal performance. This paper provides a framework to establish apriori maximum attainable levels of air-side cooling performance for a given class of fin geometry over a basis of continuously varied footprint and hydraulic constraints. A model of packaging volume required for air moving devices to deliver flow and pressure is developed. It is shown how single fin thermal model results may be extrapolated to multiple fan-heatsink combinations within an open design space. A method to identify fin-fan combinations to achieve maximum system volumetric conductance levels is presented. The methodology is extendable to other volumetricaly constrained heat exchanger problems.

AB The present simulation study elaborates on a FE CFD model (Gerogiorgis and Ydstie, 2003) developed for a candidate carbothermic aluminium reactor (Johansen and Aune, 2002), aimed at industrial implementation of carbothermic Al production. Carbothermic reduction is an alternative to the conventional Hall-Heroult electrolysis process and is characterized by cost and environmental advantages as well as by a challenging complexity. Process technology encompasses a wide spectrum of phenomena (convection, diffusion, reaction, evaporation, electric field) that occur simultaneously in a multiphase configuration, the geometry of which is an open design problem and remains to be determined without prior experience or even abundance of experimental data. The strong interaction among Joule heating, endothermic reaction, natural Boussinesq convection and turbulent flow phenomena is of paramount importance for understanding reactor performance; conducting CFD simulations is an efficient way to advance with the latter goal, since reliable high-temperature measurements of state variables are remarkably laborious, uncertain and expensive. The quadruple PDE problem (electric charge, heat, momentum and gas volume balances) for the slag flow in the ARP reactor is solved via a commercial CFD software suite (FEMLAB(R) v. 2.3) to obtain potential, temperature, velocity and gas volume fraction distributions in a two-dimensional domain, representing in detail the complete second stage of the proposed carbothermic reactor. The new challenge is the present paper is to accurately calculate the volume fraction of the gas generated within the molten slag and understand how the proposed geometry affects production, via the instantaneous thermodynamic equilibrium assumption. The main objective of this CFD study is to extract conclusions regarding the reactive slag flow, the extent of space utilization and the existence of dead volumes, and to provide design guidelines. A steady state sensitivity analysis of state variable distributions (namely, potential, temperature, velocity and gas volume fraction) with respect to a key design variable (the imposed voltage profile) reveals the reactor heating potential, the geometry of the Al region and the nontrivial operation, design and optimization problems.

AB Background and objective. Nitric oxide (NO) is an almost ubiquitous messenger molecule and is implicated in several disorders. N-G monomethyl L-arginine (L-NMMA:546C88) is an inhibitor of all three NO synthases (NOS), the enzymes that catalyse the production of NO. The present study was performed to evaluate the dose-response relation of L-NMMA to improve the design and interpretation of studies in migraine sufferers and other diseases.
   Methods. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design, six healthy volunteers were randomised to receive three different doses of L-NMMA (0.3 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg) or placebo (5% dextrose) intravenously (iv) over 5 min on four different days. On a fifth study day, in an open design, the same subjects received L-NMMA in the dose 6 mg/kg iv over 15 min. The effect of L-NMMA on the maximal mean blood velocity (V-mean) in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) (transcranial Doppler), the luminal diameter of the radial artery (high-frequency ultrasound), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate and electrocardiogram were repeatedly followed every 5 min until 60 min after start of the infusion, then every 15 min during the following hour, and at 3 h and 4 h.
   Results. Inhibition of NOS had no effect on V-mean in MCA or on the diameter of the radial artery, but MAP increased and heart rate decreased dose dependently. With a dose of 6-mg/kg L-NMMA infused over a 15-min period, the maximum MAP increase was 20% 20 min after the start of L-NMMA infusion. The maximum decrease of heart rate was 24% 15 min after start of the L-NMMA infusion.
   Conclusion. L-NMMA in a dose that caused marked changes in systemic blood pressure and heart rate had no effect on cerebral and radial arteries in man.

AB The importance of exact patient positioning in radiation therapy increases with the ongoing improvements in irradiation planning and treatment. Therefore, new ways to overcome precision limitations of current positioning methods in fractionated treatment have to be found. The Department of Medical Physics at the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) follows different video-based approaches to increase repositioning precision. In this context, the modular software framework FIVE (Fast Integrated Video-based Environment) has been designed and implemented. It is both hardware- and platform-independent and supports merging position data by integrating various computer-aided patient positioning methods. A highly precise optical tracking system and several subtraction imaging techniques have been realized as modules to supply basic video-based repositioning techniques. This paper describes the common framework architecture, the main software modules and their interfaces. An object-oriented software engineering process has been applied using the UML, C++ and the Qt library. The significance of the current framework prototype for the application in patient positioning as well as the extension to further application areas will be discussed. Particularly in experimental research, where special system adjustments are often necessary, the open design of the software allows problem-oriented extensions and adaptations.

TI Gabapentin in antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia: results of
   1-year follow-up
SO JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS
LA English
DT Article

ID SCHIZOPHRENIA; HALOPERIDOL; CLOZAPINE
AB Background: In a previous study, improvement of antipsychotic-induced blefarospasm, and involuntary oral-mandibulo movements were observed with the use of the anticonvulsant drug gabapentin among affectively ill patients who had been exposed to maintenance neuroleptics. The results reported in the present paper represent the sequel to the previous study. Methods: The purported efficacy of gabapentin in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia has been assessed in an open design 1-year follow-up study, in which 30 schizoaffective, bipolar I and schizophrenic patients from seven Italian centres were evaluated by means of AIMS. The results showed a statistically significant time-related decrease in AIMS scores. The mean percentage of improvement at AIMS was 47.5+/-18.2%. An improvement of more than 35% after 1 year in 76% of the subjects who completed the trial (n = 25) and in 63.3% of the entire sample admitted to the study was revealed. Limitation: Open trial. Conclusion: The introduction of new antipsychotic drugs has probably already limited the problems related to tardive dyskinesia. However, this type of side-effect is also observed during the course of treatment with atypical neuroleptics albeit with a lesser frequency. The fact that gabapentin treatment may have further improved clinical conditions of patients in whom therapeutic protocols had already been modified, appears to suggest exertion of a possible synergic action by the new neuroleptics on tardive dyskinesia.

AB Background: The safety and efficacy of the combination of risperidone and topiramate in the long-term treatment of mania were assessed in a 12-month, multicenter open study.
   Method: Subjects (N = 58) who met DSM-IV criteria for bipolar disorder and for a manic episode received both risperidone and topiramate for the treatment of their manic symptoms. Patients with mixed episodes were excluded. Risperidone could be discontinued at any point, but patients had to be on topiramate therapy for at least 12 months to be considered completers. Efficacy was assessed with the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and a modified version of the Clinical Global Impressions for Bipolar Disorder (CGI-BP-M). Safety was assessed with systematic collection of side effect data, weight, and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) scores, to address the risk of switch into depression.
   Results: 41 patients (70.7%) completed the study. There was a significant improvement on the YMRS (p < .001) and the CGI-BP-M subscales for manic symptoms (p < .005) and long-term outcome (p < .005) from week 2 onward. Relapse rates were significantly lower during the 12-month study period compared to the precedent year (p < .0001). There was no increase in depressive symptoms as measured by the HAM-D. 37 patients (63.8 %) experienced at least 1 adverse event, the most frequent of which was somnolence (N = 7, 12.1%). At endpoint, the patients' mean weight had decreased an average of 1.1 +/- 0.4 kg.
   Conclusion: Despite the limitations inherent to the open design, this naturalistic study suggests that the combination of risperidone and topiramate may be a valuable option for the short- and long-term treatment of mania.

AB The authors investigated the microlevel processes of collaborative reasoning in heterogeneous peer dyads working on an open-design task in elementary geometry. Special attention was paid to the nature of student social interaction, problem-solving strategies, and mathematical language and how they shape collaborative problem-solving processes. Qualitative case-based analyses of 3 focal dyads reveal that collaborative reasoning was supported by equal participation in social interaction, consisting of joint negotiation of problem-solving strategies and active conceptualization and visualization of the situation. Challenges to collaboration were manifested in the existence of divergent strategies and verbal conceptualizations where negotiation did not lead to the construction of a shared understanding. In summary, the study demonstrates the power of microlevel process analyses in revealing the interpersonal dynamics of collaborative reasoning and shows how those dynamics mediate the learning opportunities in peer interactive dyads.

TI Force-feedback joystick as a low-cost haptic interface for an

SO APPLIED PHYSICS A-MATERIALS SCIENCE & PROCESSING
LA English
DT Article
ID TOOL; DISSECTION; SURFACE
AB In order to manipulate materials at the nanometer scale, new methods and devices have to be developed. A nanomanipulator interface was designed and implemented in a commercial atomic-force-microscope (AFM) system. With the aid of a positioning joystick, direct positioning of the AFM probe with nanometer precision was possible. A commercial force-feedback joystick served as a haptic interface and provided the user with real-time feeling of the tip-sample interactions. Due to the open design, the manipulator interface could be used with other microscopes of the SPM family. In addition, the nanomanipulator and an UV-laser microbeam for photoablation were combined on an inverted optical microscope. To test the nanomanipulator, human metaphase chromosomes were dissected using both photoablation and mechanical AFM manipulation. The experimental results show that by combining both methods, biological material can be manipulated on different size scales in one integrated instrument. The effects of manipulation on the chromosome were studied in detail by AFM. Sub-400 nm cuts were achieved by photonic ablation. Chromosomal fragments of a size less than of 500 nm could be isolated. By means of mechanical microdissection, different cut sizes ranging from 80 um to 500 nm could be easily obtained by applying different load forces.

AB Rapid Translation System (RTS) is a cell-free protein production system employing an enhanced Escherichia coli lysate to perform coupled in vitro transcription-translation reactions. A continuous supply of energy substrates, nucleotides and amino acids combined with the removal of by-products guarantees a high yield of protein production. The gene to express is either cloned into a plasmid vector or introduced as a PCR product amenable to automation. The main property of this alternative system to cellular expression systems is its open design allowing direct manipulation of the reaction conditions and applications that are impossible or difficult in cell-based systems. RTS offers new promising possibilities in the postgenomic era.

AB Core-based IC design introduces more test challenges, especially in an open design environment. Macro Test is an effective test strategy. However, the measurement of plenitude of transfers and effects which crucially affects the test protocol expansion remains a problem, and the high-level abstraction of description of cores contributes to this measurement difficulty. In this paper, transparentability is defined to represent the ability that a core can be treated as transparent to the core-under-test in test phase. Then some measuring factors of it independent of circuit structure are proposed. And they are further classified into transparentability level 1 and level 2. The two levels of transparentability may be used as a common measurement, even if the core is described in RT level or hi-her abstraction level, and they are not limited to be used in Macro Test. The differences between transparentability and conventional testability are also discussed.

AB Objective: Our aim was to compare the effect of lacidipine and chlorthalidone on cardiovascular outcome as a primary parameter and blood pressure as a secondary in elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension in a prospective study with an open design. Methods: 1882 males and females outpatients greater than or equal to60 years were randomly assigned to the administration of chlorthalidone 12.5.mg o.d. or lacidipine 4 mg o.d. Patients were recruited if sitting systolic blood pressure was greater than or equal to160 mmHg with a diastolic blood pressure equal or lower than 95 mmHg. Primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Results: At randomization mean systolic blood pressure was 178.1 mmHg in the lacidipine and 178.2 mmHg in the chlorthalidone group, the corresponding mean diastolic values being 86.9 and 86.8 mmHg. In both lacidipine and chlorthalidone groups treatment caused a significant (p<0.001) and marked systolic blood pressure reduction which was maintained throughout the treatment period with a significant (p<0.001) and steady although less marked reduction in diastolic blood pressure as well. At the end of treatment period (median 32 months), the reduction was 36.8/8.1 mmHg (systolic/diastolic) in the chlorthalidone and 38.4/7.9 mmHg in the lacidipine group, the final on treatment blood pressures being 142.0/79.2 and 143.2/79.5 mmHg, respectively. Treatments were similarly effective in males and females and in age groups between 60 and 69 years (n=763), 70 and 79 years (n=744) and greater than or equal to80 years (n=375). Similar reductions were obtained in a subgroup of patients (n=209) followed in double-blind fashion for 1 year. The overall incidence of the primary endpoints was 9.3% with no significant between-group difference. Total mortality was also similar between groups. Conclusions: In elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension, administration of lacidipine or chlorthalidone markedly reduced systolic blood pressure with no difference in the incidence of cardiovascular events and total mortality.

AB An increasing interest towards the utilization of open hardware and software platforms for industrial control applications has arisen during the last decade. Some of the most important developed projects are OSACA in Europe, OSEC in Japan and OMAC in the US. All these efforts are directed to the definition of an open architecture for controllers of manufacturing systems. The PC (personal computer) as the control platform facilitates the conectivity, standardization and availability of components, and the cost reduction. An aspect, however, remains scarcely analized: the application of these concepts on equipments designed with a propietary control structure. An open control system for an SCARA industrial robot YAMAHA YK7000 has been developed to analize its viability and evaluate difficulties and limitations. The controller follows the guidelines defined by the OMAC architecture (Open Modular Architecture for Controllers). The control functions were implemented on a dual platform (two PCs): The first PC supports the critical functions. executing the paths planning and axes control tasks with a commercial axes control card. The second one supports the functions of user interfacing with the user and other non-critical time applications. Both computers are connected by a TCP/IP link.

AB C-arm volume reconstruction has become increasingly popular over the last years. These imaging systems generate 3D data sets for various interventional procedures such as endovascular treatment of aneurysms,or orthopedic applications. Due to their open design and mechanical instability, C-arm imaging systems acquire projections along non-ideal scan. trajectories. Volume reconstruction from filtered 2D X-ray projections requires a very precise knowledge of the imaging geometry. We show that the 3D image quality of C-arm cone beam imaging devices can be improved by proper design of the calibration phantom.

AB Through the design of a densified (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.98)MnO3 (LSM) embedded 8% YSZ ceramic wafer with a well defined, readily observable triple-phase boundary (TPB), we have demonstrated that (Cr,Mn)(3)O-4 spinel crystals grow preferentially on the YSZ side of the TPB during cathodic polarization of a half-cell at 800degreesC in the presence of a chromia-forming stainless steel electrical contact. In all examples studied, chromium species transfer to the TPB region is seen well before any observable degradation of the half-cell performance. Because solid Cr2O3 was not observed at or near the TPB, it is believed that the open design allows rapidly equilibration of deposited Cr2O3 with the gaseous Cr species, while the more stable spinel phases remain at the interface. The results presented here show that, if the TPB region is not blocked by solid species, little if any effects due to chromium poisoning are observed.

AB The Portland State Aerospace Society (PSAS) is a small, low-budget amateur aerospace group. PSAS is currently developing medium-sized sub-orbital rockets with the eventual goal of inserting nanosatellites (satellites that weigh less than 10 kg) into orbit. Because achieving orbit requires a navigation system able to guide the rocket along an orbital trajectory, PSAS is pioneering an open source and open hardware avionics system that is capable of active guidance.
   In this paper, we describe how free software and open hardware have dramatically changed the capabilities of amateur aerospace groups like PSAS. We show how we have applied existing and custom free software to the avionics and ground support systems of a sub-orbital sounding rocket, and discuss what further work must be done.
   We conclude that the sophistication and complexity achieved by current amateur avionics projects-which are beginning to challenge the distinction between amateur and professional-would not be possible without the use of free software.

TI Effect of thalidomide in patients with chronic heart failure
SO AMERICAN HEART JOURNAL

DT Article
ID NECROSIS-FACTOR-ALPHA; RECEPTORS; CYTOKINES; RESPONSES
AB Background Congestive heart failure (CHF) is characterized by enhanced immune activation, which possibly plays a pathogenic role in this disorder. We therefore examined whether immunomodulation with thalidomide could improve cardiac performance in patients with CHF.
   Methods Nine patients with chronic symptomatic CHF and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <40%, who were receiving "optimal" conventional cardiovascular treatment, were given 200 mg thalidomide daily in an open design for a period of 6 weeks. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and LVEF were measured at baseline and on completion of the study.
   Results Two patients withdrew because of side effects. Sedation was common and required dose reduction in 6 of 7 patients completing the study. Plasma levels of TNF-alpha were elevated at baseline compared with levels in healthy control. patients, but decreased significantly from 33.9 +/- 10.1 pg/ml to 19.3 +/- 6.1 pg/ml during therapy (P<.05). LVEF increased in all patients from 26%+/-9% to 34%+/-10% at the end of the observation period (P<.05).
   Conclusions in this pilot study, therapy with thalidomide in patients with CHF resulted in decreased TNF-alpha levels and increased cardiac performance. Although few patients were included, our results suggest that thalidomide should be further investigated as an immunomodulating agent in CHF.

AB The effects of estrogen replacement therapy on lipid and glucose metabolism as related to abdominal fat distribution were investigated in fifty-one healthy postmenopausal women aged 52-53 years. They were randomized to treatment with either estradiol 2 mg or placebo daily for three months in a double-blind design. Forty-six women continued with estradiol for another nine months in an open design with the addition of medroxyprogesterone for ten days every three months. Intra-abdominal and subcutaneous abdominal fat, and intrapelvic and subcutaneous pelvic fat was estimated by computed tomography before and after one year of estrogen treatment. Euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp, oral glucose tolerance test and analyses of blood lipids were performed after 3 and 12 months of treatment. Estrogen replacement therapy decreased body fat mass as well as intra-abdominal and intrapelvic fat, but not the subcutaneous fat compartments. LDL cholesterol decreased and HDL cholesterol increased, whereas triglycerides were not changed by one year of estrogen treatment. Insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance were not affected by estrogen treatment. In postmenopausal women estrogen treatment for one year decreased intra-abdominal and intrapelvic fat compartments, but this was not related to changes in plasma lipid levels. Insulin sensitivity and plasma triglycerides were not affected by estrogen treatment.

ID BIPOLAR DISORDER; SCHIZOPHRENIA; LITHIUM; SCALE
AB Background: A number of open studies and preliminary results of unpublished double-blind trials have suggested that the novel antipsychotic risperidone may be effective and well tolerated in the treatment of acute mania in bipolar disorder. Methods: A total of 174 patients entered this large, open, multicentre trial. Inclusion criteria were: current manic, hypomanic or mixed episode (DSM-IV), and a Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score of > 7. Assessments included the YMRS, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), Clinical Global Impression (CGI), and Udvalg for Kliniske Undersogelser (UKU) subscale for neurological side effects. Results: There were significant reductions (P < 0.0001) on the YMRS, PANSS and HAM-D scores and a significant improvement (P < 0.0001) in CGI ratings at the endpoint. There were no statistically significant increments in the severity of extrapyramidal symptoms according to the UKU. Risperidone was generally well tolerated. The mean dose of risperidone at the endpoint was 4.9 +/- 2.9 mg/day. Conclusions and clinical implications: This open study provides further evidence that risperidone is safe and effective in combination with mood stabilisers in the manic phase of bipolar disorder. Limitations: The open design and the use of concomitant medications make unclear to what extent the positive results were entirely related to risperidone. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

SO JOURNAL OF MICROMECHANICS AND MICROENGINEERING

DT Article
AB Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) design and manufacturing are inherently multi-physical and multi-disciplinary; no single person is able to perform a full development process for a MEM device or system. In this paper we develop a WWW-based design platform for collaborative design of MEMS. The proposed web-based distributed object modeling and evaluation framework with client-knowledge server architecture, KS-WebDOME, allows multi-users/designers in different locations to participate in the same design process. Under this framework, concurrent integrated MEMS design and simulation models can be built using both local and distributed resources, and the design collaboration can be realized by exchanging services between modules based upon CORBA standard communication protocol. To facilitate the rapid construction of the concurrent integrated design models for MEMS, a prototype design system, Web-MEMS Designer, is implemented through concurrent integration of multiple distributed and cooperative knowledge sources and software. By use of the developed prototype system, MEMS design and simulation can be carried out simultaneously and intelligently in an integrated but open design environment on the web. The case of a microgripper design for micro-robotic assembly systems is provided to illustrate how designers in different teams and organizations may participate and collaborate in MEMS design.

AB The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the general utility of the first dedicated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) unit enabling upright, weight-bearing positional evaluation of the spinal column (pMRI) during various dynamic-kinetic maneuvers (kMRI) in patients with degenerative conditions of the spine.
   This study consisted of a prospective analysis of cervical and lumbar imaging examinations. All studies were performed on a recently introduced whole body MRI system (Stand-Up(TM) MRI, Fonar Corp, Melville, NY). The system operates at 0.6T using an electromagnet with a horizontal field, transverse to the longitudinal axis of the patient's body. Depending upon spinal level, all examinations were acquired with either a cervical or lumbar solenoidal radiofrequency receiver coil. This unit is configured with a top/front-open design, incorporating a patient-scanning table with tilt, translation and elevation functions. The unique motorized patient handling system developed for the scanner allows for vertical (upright, weight bearing) and horizontal (recumbent) positioning of all patients. The top/front-open construction also allows dynamic-kinetic flexion and extension maneuvers of the spine. Patterns of bony and soft tissue change occurring among recumbent (rMRI) and upright neutral positions (pMRI), and dynamic-kinetic acquisitions (kMRI) were sought.
   Depending on the specific underlying pathologic degenerative condition, significant alterations observed on pMRI and kMRI that were either more or less pronounced than on rMRI included: fluctuating anterior and posterior disc herniations, hypermobile spinal instability, central spinal canal and spinal neural foramen stenosis and general sagittal spinal contour changes. No patient suffered from feelings of claustrophobia that resulted in termination of the examination.
   In conclusion, the potential relative beneficial aspects of upright, weight-bearing (pMRI), dynamic-kinetic (kMRI) spinal imaging on this system over that of recumbent MRI (rMRI) include: the revelation of occult disease dependent on true axial loading, the unmasking of kinetic-dependent disease, and the ability to scan the patient in the position of clinically relevant signs and symptoms. This imaging unit also demonstrated low claustrophobic potential and yielded relatively high-resolution images with little motion/chemical-shift artifact.

AB Objective: To investigate the effects of I mg 17beta-estradiol continuously combined with 2.5, 5, 10, or 20 mg dydrogesterone on the serum lipid profile of postmenopausal women.
   Design: Serum lipid profile was measured in two 1-year studies performed in healthy, nonhysterectomized, postmenopausal women. One study (n = 182) had an open design and investigated oral 17beta-estradiol I mg daily continuously combined with dydrogesterone 2.5 mg daily; the other study (n = 326) had a double-blind, randomized design and investigated oral 17beta-estradiol I mg daily continuously combined with dydrogesterone at doses of 5, 10, or 20 mg daily.
   Results: With all four dosages of dydrogesterone, serum total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly reduced (-4.6% to -7.6% and -6.3% to -11.6%, respectively), whereas high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was significantly increased (+4.3% to +7.4%). Serum apolipoprotein A I and B also improved significantly, reflecting the favorable changes in high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, as did lipoprotein(a).
   Conclusion: Oral 17beta-estradiol I mg daily continuously combined with dydrogesterone 2.5 to 20 mg daily has beneficial effects on serum lipid profile in postmenopausal women.

ID EXPOSURE; NURSES
AB Objective: Patients admitted to the trauma intensive care unit (TICU) often require bedside imaging procedures such as radiographs, fluoroscopic placement of enteral feeding tubes, and insertion of vena cava filters. The potential for scattered radiation exposure is a concern to healthcare workers. Our study's purpose was to measure the level of scattered ionizing radiation present in a TICU.
   Design and Setting: This prospective study was conducted over 3 months in an open-design, ten-bed TICU of a Level I trauma center.
   Interventions and Measurements., Fifteen dosimeters were placed in selected areas of the TIN to measure the amount of scattered radiation present. Standard radiation protection precautions were used throughout the study period. At the end of each month, data from the dosimeters were sent to the manufacturer for analysis.
   Main Results: One thousand seventy-four radiologic studies were performed at the bedside during the study period (803 portable chest radiographs, 103 abdominal radiographs, 303 extremity radiographs, 223 spine radiographs, and 15 fluoroscopic procedures). Dosimetry analysis showed <5 mrem (1/1000 roentgen equivalent in man) scattered radiation per month (<60 mrem/year) in each of the monitored areas. All monitored areas measured <2 mrem per week of scattered radiation when adjusted for occupancy.
   Conclusions: The level of scattered radiation in our TICU is less than the recommended allowable exposure of <100 mrem/year, indicating that radiation exposure is not a significant occupational hazard in our TICU, even in the setting of frequent use of bedside imaging studies.

ID SHORT-TERM ITRACONAZOLE; EFFICACY
AB An open-design, prospective, non-comparative study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of itraconazole in the treatment of tinea pedis (interdigital-type, hyperkeratotic-type and the combination of both). Treatment consisted of one pulse of itraconazole, meaning that each patient received 400 mg/day for one week. Clinical and mycologic control examinations were performed at baseline and at the end of treatment; follow-up visits took place at 30 and 60 days after the last medication administration. A total of 44 patients were evaluated. The major causal agent isolated was Trichophyton rubrum (93%). At the final follow-up visit (60 days), 37 cases (84.4%) achieved clinical and mycologic cure; 5 (11.3%) had improvement and 2 cases (4.5%) failed. Three cases reported side effects attributable to itraconazole (6.6%); one patient had a moderate headache and two reported moderate dyspepsia. None of the 3 cases required discontinuation of the medication. We concluded that the administration of one pulse of itraconazole is an effective, safe and short regimen to treat tinea pedis.

AB Both hydroxyapatite (Ha) and titanium (Ti) are well-accepted alloplastic materials for ossicular prostheses. Many different designs of Ha and Ti prostheses are presently available. Fourteen surgeons of different seniority and surgical experience were asked to 'test-drive' four different types of ossicular prostheses in cadaveric temporal bones to investigate the user-friendliness of these protheses. The Goldenberg design Ha incus prosthesis and the Dusseldorf design Bell Ti prosthesis were used as partial ossicular replacement prostheses (PORP). The Richards design Ha incus-stapes prosthesis and the Dusseldorf design Aerial Ti prosthesis were used as a total ossicular replacement prostheses (TORP). Nine out of 14 surgeons found the Ha PORP to be more user-friendly because of the notch design in the head. The Ti prosthesis was found to be more difficult to manipulate because it was too light. Half of the surgeons preferred the Ti TORP because of the open design of the top-plate. The Ha TORP was thought to be too top-heavy and to have a tendency to fall over.

AB Recent Alcator C-Mod experimental campaigns have focused upon the study of the Advanced Tokamak regimes, which includes characterization of the RF heating, the formation and dynamics of internal barriers, H-mode edge pedestal, and divertor and scrape-off physics. The WRIT system has been recently upgraded with the improved performance of the 4-strap antenna. Total ICRF power in excess of 5 MW has been launched successfully into the plasma during this campaign. Due to the compact nature of C-Mod, the power feeds for the antenna are vacuum strip lines. Their orientation, to the tokamak B-field, is governed by maintaining E<15 kV/cm in locations where the RF E-field is parallel to tokamak B-field. Other modifications included improved protection tile grounding and installation of protective shields for Faraday screen ceramic isolators. The antennas also make use of BN protection tiles to eliminate high Z impurities from the antennas. The present empirical power limit results from arcing in a region of the antenna strap where Esimilar to15 kV/cm and parallel to B and injections from the metallic fasteners used to attach the BN tiles to the antenna. In preparation for 2 MA plasma operation, the inner divertor is being modified to a more open design and the lower inner wall is being reinforced. For future 5-10 sec experiments, successful 3 seconds discharges were performed at the end of the last campaign. These experiments were designed to test the magnet power supplies, plasma and supply controls, divertor heat load handling, and density control. The experiments were successful in that the systems performed flawlessly and no uncontrolled density source was observed.

AB Background Cigar smoking has become a quickly growing trend among teenagers, women, and young adults. The objective was to explore whether cigar smoking affects flow-mediated vasodilation in healthy, non-smoking young adults.
   Methods This was a prospective randomized trial with open design. It was performed in a cardiology teaching program in a private community hospital that serves as a major referral center within the greater Miami area. Apparently healthy, non-smoking young adult cardiology trainees and staff between the ages of 20 and 45 years were randomly assigned to a cigar smoking group (n = 15) or a control group (n = 14). The main outcome measures were the difference in percent diameter increase in the brachial artery after reactive hyperemia and sublingual nitroglycerin between members of the cigar smoking and control groups at baseline, measured after cigar smoking, and at 5 hours.
   Results Twenty-nine participants were randomized. Percent diameter increase in the brachial artery was measured with the use of high-resolution ultrasonography. Baseline percent diameter increase after reactive hyperemia and sublingual nitroglycerin was similar in both groups (6.2% vs 6.7%, P = .4 and 22% vs 23%, P = .5, respectively). We observed a 2.5% increase in brachial artery diameter with hyperemia after cigar smoking compared with a 9.4% increase in the control group, P = .045. Values after nitroglycerin were similar between groups, P = .2. Between-group analysis showed no significant difference in percent dilation after reactive hyperemia at 5 hours, P = .4, but a significant difference was seen after sublingual nitroglycerin, P = .02.
   Conclusions These data are compatible with the possibility that cigar smoking may have an acute effect on endothelium-dependent, flow-mediated brachial artery dilation and do not support the possibility of an immediate effect on enclothelium-independent vasodilation. Taken together, these results suggest that cigars are not an innocuous alternative to cigarette smoking.

AB Constraint programming (CP) systems are useful for solving real-life combinatorial problems, such as scheduling, planning, rostering and routing problems. The design of modern CP systems has evolved from a monolithic to an open design in order to meet the increasing demand for application-specific customization. It is widely accepted that a CP system needs to balance various design factors such as efficiency versus customizability and flexibility versus maintenance. This paper captures our experience with using different software engineering approaches in the development of constraint programming systems. These approaches allow us to systematically investigate the different factors that affect the performance of a CP system. In particular we review the application of reuse techniques, such as toolkits, framework and patterns, to the design and implementation of a finite-domain CP system.

AB The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) project was initiated in response to the growing demand for a public repository for high-throughput gene expression data. GEO provides a flexible and open design that facilitates submission, storage and retrieval of heterogeneous data sets from high-throughput gene expression and genomic hybridization experiments. GEO is not intended to replace in house gene expression databases that benefit from coherent data sets, and which are constructed to facilitate a particular analytic method, but rather complement these by acting as a tertiary, central data distribution hub. The three central data entities of GEO are platforms, samples and series, and were designed with gene expression and genomic hybridization experiments in mind. A platform is, essentially, a list of probes that define what set of molecules may be detected. A sample describes the set of molecules that are being probed and references a single platform used to generate its molecular abundance data. A series organizes samples into the meaningful data sets which make up an experiment. The GEO repository is publicly accessible through the World Wide Web at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo.

AB A fully integrated optical and electrical measurement system made of off-the-shelf optical components and electrical instruments that characterizes the micro motions for MEMS dynamic performance at the wafer/die level automatically is presented. Both periodic and non-periodic in-plane micro motions could be measured by the blur-synthesis method based on the machine vision technology. The periodic out-of-plane micro motions could be estimated by the laser stroboscopic phase-shifting interferometry with the digital image processing technology. Some improved algorithms together with the sub pixel method and 2D waveform transform technology are bought forward and experimented for the measurement of micro motions with higher resolution. The methods could measure micro motions up to tens of KHz in real time with nano resolution and the characterization is both in situ and nondestructive. Based upon the virtual instrument technology, the measurement system with friendly user interfaces, open hardware and software architectures and expansible features could be used practically in MEMS R&D field and more improvements to this system could be made continually.

In this paper general guidelines and design issues are reported, with special emphasis on the Intelligent Accelerometer Unit (IAU), based on a four-axis accelerometer, the signals of which are transmitted to the WPAN server (PSE) for on-line processing. The availability of three axis in the median plane provides an inclination measurement with high sensibility. The IAU can be worn like a patch, fixed to the back, at the height of the sacrum. A prototype of the IAU is currently under validation phase, in order to optimize signal transmission between IAU and PSE.

ID SPECKLE MASKING
AB The Dutch Open Telescope (DOT) on La Palma is a revolutionary telescope achieving high-resolution imaging of the solar surface. The DOT combines a pioneering open design at an excellent wind-swept site with image restoration through speckle interferometry. Its open principle is now followed in major solar-telescope projects elsewhere.
   In the past three years the DOT became the first solar telescope to regularly obtain 0.2" resolution in extended image sequences, i. e., reaching the diffraction limit of its 45-cm primary mirror.
   Our aim for 2003-2005 is to turn the DOT into a 0.2" tomographic mapper of the solar atmosphere with frequent partnership in international multi-telescope campaigns through student-serviced time allocation.
   After 2005 we aim to triple the DOT resolution to 0.07" by increasing the aperture to 140 cm and to renew the speckle cameras and the speckle pipeline in order to increase the field size and sequence duration appreciably. These upgrades will maintain the DOT's niche as a tomographic high-resolution mapper in the era when GREGOR, Solar-B and SDO set the stage.

   SYMPTOMS
AB In addition to dopamine, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has been reported to play an important role in schizophrenia. Besides blocking dopamine, atypical antipsychotics also block 5-HT receptors. The clinical efficacy of the atypical antipsychotic clozapine is associated with the 5-HT antagonistic action of the drug and a high serotonergic tone before treatment. The atypical antipsychotic olanzapine has a receptor-binding profile similar to that of clozapine. The present study investigated whether treatment with olanzapine blocks hormone release induced by the 5-HT2c agonist m-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP) and, if so, whether this 5-HT antagonistic effect is related to treatment response. Eighteen male schizophrenic patients participated in this study. All patients were challenged with m-CPP (0.5 mg/kg orally) in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design after a drug-free period of at least 2 weeks. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and prolactin plasma levels were measured every 30 minutes up to 210 minutes after challenge. Patients were treated for 6 weeks with 10 mg olanzapine daily in an open design, after which the challenge tests were repeated. Olanzapine significantly blocked m-CPP-induced ACTH, cortisol, and prolactin release, suggesting that it is a potent 5-HT2c antagonist in vivo. This 5-HT antagonistic effect of olanzapine was not significantly correlated with treatment response. Also, no significant correlation was found between m-CPP-induced hormone release before treatment and clinical response after treatment with olanzapine. These findings suggest that olanzapine is a potent 5-HT2c antagonist in vivo but that this is up elated to its clinical efficacy in this nonrefractory sample of schizophrenic patients.

SO CONTROL ENGINEERING PRACTICE

ID DYNAMIC LINEAR CONTROLLERS; ANALYTIC FRAMEWORK; LINEARIZATION; SYSTEMS
AB In this paper a modern gain-scheduling methodology is proposed which exploits recently developed velocity-based techniques to resolve many of the deficiencies of classical gain-scheduling approaches (restriction to near equilibrium operation, to slow rate of variation), This is achieved while maintaining continuity with linear methods and providing an open design framework (any linear synthesis approach may be used) which supports divide and conquer design strategies. The application of velocity-based gain-scheduling techniques is demonstrated in application to a demanding, highly nonlinear, missile control design task. Scheduling on instantaneous incidence (a rapidly varying quantity) is well-known to lead to considerable difficulties with classical gain-scheduling methods. It is shown that the methods proposed here can, however, be used to successfully design an effective and robust gain-scheduled controller. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Intertrochanteric osteotomies of the proximal femur are used to improve the anatomy and function of the hip joint in a number of orthopaedic diseases. To investigate the geometrical and biomechanical aspects of pre-operative planning we created a set of programs to automatically per-form a simulation of intertrochanteric osteotomies on a three-dimensional finite element model of the human proximal femur based on computed tomography (CT) data and using uniform brick-shaped elements. To eliminate artefacts resulting from the rough surface of the brick elements, the femoral head was represented by a tetrahedron-based head that included a cartilage layer and a subchondral cortical zone. Applicability of the procedure was tested by performing a parametric study using a model created from CT scans taken in vivo, by applying individually calculated force conditions for the one-leg stance situation. We found a large influence of osteotomy angle on the observed stress in the femoral head cartilage, especially in a situation with insufficient containment of the femoral head. The model presented here is a biomechanical tool to simulate intertrochanteric osteotomies patient-specifically for a better understanding of the effects of such operations in the individual case. The open design of the described programs allows future interfacing with surgical navigation and robot systems. (C) 2001 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID EQUILIBRIUM CRYSTAL SHAPES; SURFACE; STM; SEM; SILICON; SYSTEM
AB The article describes the combination of a Besocke-type scanning tunneling microscope (STM) with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) in an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) environment. The open design of the Besocke STM allows the SEM to be implemented as an add-on of a high resolution electron column and a secondary electron detector. The combined instrument is capable of atomic resolution imaging by STM and real time SEM imaging. SEM resolution down to about 80 nm was achieved. Simultaneous operation of STM and SEM is possible. The operation and performance of the combined instrument is illustrated by a variety of examples. Although the instrument is suitable for a wide range of applications where a combination of atomic resolution with lower magnification imaging is required, its operation in an UHV environment makes it particularly appropriate for the study of reactive metal surfaces.

AB The design of open-access elliptical cross-section magnet systems has recently come under consideration. Obtaining values for the forces generated within these unusual magnets is important to progress the designs towards feasible instruments. This paper presents a novel and flexible method for the rapid computation of forces within elliptical magnets. The method is demonstrated by the analysis of a clinical magnetic resonance imaging magnet of elliptical cross-section and open design. The analysis reveals the non-symmetric nature of the generated Maxwell forces, which are an important consideration, particularly in the design of superconducting systems.

Two hundred and fifty-three patients (155 males, 98 females) treated all their psoriatic lesions, except for those on the head and scalp, for up to 78 weeks. No serious adverse events were reported: 37 patients (14.6%) had a transient skin irritation reaction on one or more occasions during the study that resulted in study withdrawal for seven of them. The baseline/endpoint analyses showed no clinically relevant changes in measures of calcium and phosphorus homeostasis and renal function. Slight hypercalcaemia was observed in five (2%) patients; in four of these patients, serum albumin-adjusted total calcium levels normalized during treatment. In conclusion, twice-daily calcitriol 3 mug g(-1) ointment is safe and well tolerated in the long-term treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis.

AB PURPOSE: This study was performed according to a prospective, randomized, open design. The aim was to test the efficacy of local application of nifedipine ointment in healing acute thrombosed external hemorrhoids. METHODS: Ninety-eight patients who gave their informed consent were recruited; they received clinical examination and anoscopy. A questionnaire to evaluate symptoms, pain, and concurrent use of analgesics was administered. Patients treated with nifedipine (n = 50) used topical 0.3 percent nifedipine and 1.5 percent lidocaine ointment every 12 hours for two weeks. The control group, consisting of 48 patients, received topical 1.5 percent lidocaine ointment during therapy. RESULTS: Results obtained were as follows: complete relief of pain in 43 patients (86 percent) of the nifedipine-treated group as opposed to 24 patients (50 percent) of the control group after 7 days of therapy (P < 0.01); oral analgesics were used by 4 patients (8 percent) in the nifedipine-treated group as opposed to 26 patients (54.1 percent) of the control group after 7 days of therapy (P < 0.01); and resolution of acute thrombosed external hemorrhoids was achieved after 14 days of therapy in 46 patients (92 percent) of the nifedipine-treated group, as opposed to 22 patients (45.8 percent) of the control group (P < 0.01). We did not observe any systemic side effect in patients treated with nifedipine. CONCLUSIONS: Our study clearly demonstrates that the use of topical nifedipine, which at present is for treatment of cardiovascular disorders, is a reliable new option in the conservative treatment of thrombosed external hemorrhoids.

AB The effect of citalopram was investigated in 20 mentally retarded patients suffering from a depressive disorder characterized by alterations in the domains of affectivity, motivation, motor activity and vital signs. The study followed a baseline-controlled open design. Citalopram was started in a daily dosage of 20 mg that was kept unchanged for 6 weeks. Thereafter dosage was adjusted to maximally 60 mg per day. Treatment effects were assessed according to the Clinical Global Improvement Scale (CGIS) after at least 6 months.
   In 12 of the 20 patients a moderate to marked improvement in all domains was observed upon treatment with 20-40 mg citalopram daily. Treatment for one year in the effective dose prevented recurrence of depressive symptomatology. Concomitant use of sedative anticonvulsants reduced responsiveness to treatment. No interactions were observed. It is concluded that citalopram is a well-tolerated, safe and effective antidepressant in mentally retarded subjects with depressive disorders.

AB Objective: To compare the efficacy, safety, cost and effects on platelet aggregation of unfractionated heparin and low-molecular weight heparin in unstable angina patients. Patients and methods: Ninety-three patients with unstable angina were randomized to receive either unfractionated heparin (UFH) or enoxaparin in an open design clinical trial with blinded end point evaluation. The effects of the heparins on platelet aggregation were also compared. Results: The composite end point of myocardial infarction, cardiac death, recurrent angina and need for intervention was observed in 62% of patients treated with UFH and in 37% of patients treated with enoxaparin (RR 1.7, 95% CI 0.75 to 3.71, p = 0.04). There was no difference in the frequency or severity of adverse events, A cost-effectiveness analysis showed both the heparins to be similar. Platelet aggregation was inhibited to a greater extent by UFH when compared to enoxaparin. Conclusions: Enoxaparin appears to be superior in efficacy to UFH and similar to UFH in safety. No difference in costs was detected in this study. The greater inhibition of platelet aggregation observed in the case of UFH compared to enoxaparin indicates that there may be more bleeding complications with UFH.

AB In DSM-IV, winter seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is classified as a seasonal pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes in winter with full remission of symptoms in summer. However, other groups with "winter depression" have been identified, including patients with incomplete summer remission (ISR) and subsyndromal SAD (sub-SAD, winter depressive symptoms that do not meet criteria for major depression). In this study, we compare the clinical characteristics of these three seasonal groups and their response to light therapy. Method: 558 patients assessed at a specialized SAD Clinic were diagnosed using DSM-LII-R or DSM-IV criteria. Clinical information was recorded using a checklist at index assessment. A subset of patients (N = 192) were treated with an open, 2 week trial of light therapy using a 10 000 lux fluorescent light box for 30 min per day in the early morning. Patients were assessed before and after treatment with the 29 item modified Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and clinical response was defined as greater than 50% improvement in scores. Results: The rates of some melancholic symptoms, anxiety, panic, suicidal ideation, and family history of mood disorder were lowest in the sub-SAD group. The clinical response rates to light therapy were highest in the sub-SAD group (N = 32, 78%), intermediate in the SAD group (N 113, 66%), and lowest in the ISR group (N = 47, 51%). Limitations: This was a retrospective study of patients seen in a specialty clinic, although information was obtained in a standardized format. The light therapy trial had an open design so that placebo response could not be determined. Conclusions: There are differences in both the patterns of clinical symptoms and the response to light therapy in these three groups with winter depression. These results are consistent with a dual vulnerability hypothesis that considers these groups to result from interaction of separate factors for seasonality and depression.

AB Objective: Many patients with seasonal affective disorder (SAD) have dysfunctional eating behaviors. Conversely, many women with bulimia nervosa have marked winter worsening of mood and bulimic symptoms. Controlled studies of light therapy in SAD and in bulimia nervosa have shown beneficial effects on mood and binge/ purge symptoms. We explored the clinical use of light therapy in women with SAD who also had comorbid bulimia nervosa.
   Method: Twenty-two female patients diagnosed using DSM-IV criteria with both bulimia nervosa and major depressive disorder with a seasonal (winter) pattern were treated with an open design, 4-week trial of light therapy (10,000 lux fluorescent light box with an ultraviolet filter, 30 to 60 minutes per day in the early morning). Patients were assessed before and after treatment with depression scales and with binge/purge diaries.
   Results: Light therapy resulted in significant improvement in mood, with a mean 56% reduction in 29-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores following treatment (p < .001). The frequency of binges and purges per week also significantly decreased (p < .001) from baseline by a mean of 46% and 36%, respectively. Two (9%) of 22 patients became abstinent of binge/ purge episodes, compared with 10 (45%) of 22 patients who met criteria for remission of depres- sive symptoms. The light therapy was well tolerated by patients.
   Conclusion: These results suggest that therapeutic effects of light therapy on mood and bulimic symptoms in patients with SAD and comorbid bulimia nervosa are sustained over at least 4 weeks. However, the low abstinence rate in bulimic symptoms indicates that light therapy may be most effectively used as an adjunctive treatment to medications and/or psychotherapy for bulimia nervosa.

TI Evaluation of blood lead proficiency testing: Comparison of open and
   blind paradigms
SO CLINICAL CHEMISTRY
LA English
DT Article
ID LABORATORY PERFORMANCE; EXPOSURE; QUALITY
AB Backguound: Most proficiency testing (PT) programs operate with an open design in which clearly identified performance samples are distributed directly to participating laboratories on a shipping schedule announced in advance. In this study, we examine the effectiveness of assessing clinical laboratory performance for blood lead with an open PT by comparing its results with a double-blinded testing protocol.
   Methods: Aliquots from up to 72 blood lead performance pools from the New York State Department of Health and the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene were disguised as routine patient specimens and submitted in two phases to up to 42 certified clinical laboratories for blood lead analysis. These 42 laboratories also received aliquots of the same performance samples for blood lead analysis directly from the "open" PT program provider.
   Results: Data reported under blind and open strategies were scored against acceptable target ranges using the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA'88) criteria established for blood lead, i.e., +/- 0.19 mu mol/L (+/- 4 mug/dL) or +/- 10%, whichever is greater. Performance differences between the strategies were also assessed. We found that 17.7% of all blind PT results were classified as unacceptable compared with only 4.5% of open PT results (P <0.001). In phase 1, 13 of 22 laboratories (60%) exhibited a statistically significant difference (P <0.05) between their blind and open PT performances, although for 6 laboratories the poorer blind performance may not necessarily have led to unsuccessful PT participation under CLIA '88 criteria. Seven (32%) laboratories had unsuccessful aggregate performance (<80%) under blind testing while maintaining successful performance in open testing. Of these seven, two had gross discrepancies motivating further investigation.
   Conclusions: The data suggest that although <similar to>60% of clinical laboratories make special efforts to improve analytical performance on open PT samples relative to performance achieved for routine patient specimens, in most cases the differences are clinically insignificant and would not likely affect cumulative PT performance. Occasional use of blind PT may deter the inclination to treat performance samples more carefully. (C) 2001 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.

AB A systematic review of chemotherapy trials in several tumour types was performed by The Swedish Council of Technology Assessment in Health Care (SBU). The procedures for the evaluation of the scientific literature are described separately (Acta Oncol 2001: 40: 155-65). The conclusions of this overview in pancreatic cancer are based on 10 randomised studies with, and 18 randomised studies without. an untreated control group. Altogether. 4028 patients were included in the phase III studies. Furthermore, 32 phase II studies or retrospective analyses including 1404 patients have been evaluated. The conclusions reached can be summarized into the following points:
   There is no convincing evidence that pancreatic cancer patients benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy treatment, with or without concomitant radiotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with pancreatic cancer should thus not be used routinely.
   In locally advanced/metastatic pancreatic cancer, six randomised trials comparing combination chemotherapy with an untreated control group were retrieved. In three trials, two of which were performed recently. chemotherapy provided statistically significant prolongation in median survival in the range of three to nine months. The three other trials, all reported in the early 80s. essentially showed no difference in survival between the treatment groups.
   In the locally advanced/metastatic setting there are also several randomised trials comparing various chemotherapy regimens. Except for an improvement in median survival of one to two months from gemcitabine compared with 5-FU. no differences were observed.
   There is no convincing evidence that a large fraction of pancreatic cancer patients will benefit from palliative chemotherapy. The few open-design studies that have explored the influence on symptom relief/quality of life indicate that between 20-35% of the patients get clinical benefit, but usually short-lived.
   Recently performed randomised studies, all using adequate methodology, indicate that the beneficial effects observed in advanced pancreatic cancer are similar to those of accepted therapy in other cancer types. However, due to the limited positive effects. palliative chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer can only be recommended selectively and should preferably be used within controlled clinical trials exploring new treatment combinations or concepts.

AB An innovative product for 3D-mapping validation on robotics is introduced on this paper as result of the application of a multi-robot programming and simulation software to that purpose. The software, called Virtual Robot Simulator (YRS), has an open design that facilitates the integration of user's applications by means of external components that give access to its main functionalities. For example, realistic and smart graphics representation of 3D-maps can be easily generated using simple functions. In fact, the user can concentrate the efforts on implementing sensor models, signal filters, 3D-mapping methods and so on, and leave the arduous work of graphics representation to VRS. Then VRS acts as a "true" virtual cell composed of robots with sensors moving on their environment and reflecting the actions of the user's application. Even more, the specific physical sensor and robot is transparent to the user when decides to take the best of the hierarchical software structure offered to manage this kind of systems. A practical example is commented on the paper.

AB We describe the successful treatment of five patients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (TR-MDD) with a combination pharmacotherapy of pindolol, tryptophan and nefazodone. Five TR-MDD outpatients who had previously not responded to at least four different antidepressant medication trials were initiated on 300 mg/day of nefazodone, 7.5 mg/day of pindolol and 1 g/day of tryptophan. Pindolol doses remained the same throughout the 20 weeks, while tryptophan and nefazodone dosages were gradually increased to 8 g/day and 450 mg/day, respectively. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale CHAM-IP) was used to evaluate outcome. By week 4, all cases demonstrated at least 50% decrease in HAM-D scores. At the end of the trial, the group mean HAM-D score had significantly decreased from 26.8 (+/- 1.9) to 1.8 (+/- 0.8) (p < 0.001). No significant adverse effects were reported. These results suggest that if serotonin availability and release is further enhanced by tryptophan in the presence of nefazodone and pindolol, an antidepressant effect may be produced in patients who are otherwise. treatment-resistant. Due to limited sample: size, an open design and an 'unusually' high successful efficacy rate of this preliminary study, controlled studies are required to confirm the efficacy of this treatment strategy.

AB Requirements for the dynamic properties of a mechanical structure are commonly expressed in terms of eigenfrequencies. Therefore, during the design phase of a mechanical structure much attention is paid to natural frequencies and mode shapes. However, these modal properties tend to vary strongly if small variations are applied on the design model. Therefore, the presence of open design decisions or other uncertain parameters complicates strongly a meaningful dynamic design validation in an early design stage. A fuzzy finite element method for the eigenvalue analysis has been developed to cope with this problem. This method results in fuzzily defined modal properties indicating the degree of uncertainty on the eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes resulting from the uncertain model. However, rather than eigenfrequencies, the specification of responses at frequencies that are critical in the operating conditions of the structure would be a more realistic concept for dynamic design requirements. In order to facilitate the use of such design requirements, a tool is needed to analyze the influence of design decisions on responses at these specific frequencies. Therefore a method for the calculation of fuzzy frequency response functions of uncertain structures is presented. The procedure calculates guaranteed bounds on the envelope on the response function starting from interval bounded uncertainties on the input model. It necessitates the calculation of guaranteed boundaries on the contribution of each individual mode to the total frequency response function.

AB We present a new technological approach for in situ investigation of long-term impacts of elevated CO2 concentration (EC) on juvenile forests characterised by an intensive community level and canopy closure phase. Construction of the glass domes is based on the properties of earlier tested open-top chambers (OTCs). An air climatisation device together with an adjustable window system, that forms the shell cover of the domes, is able to keep the required [CO2] in both time and spatial scales with the relatively small consumption of supplied CO2. This is achieved by half-closing the windows on the windward side. We evidenced good coupling of treated trees to the atmosphere, including mutual interactions among trees. The semi-open design of the domes moderates the problems of strong wind, humidity, and temperature gradients associated with OTCs. The frequency distributions of the environmental variations within the domes indicate that: air temperature is maintained within the ambient range +/-1.0 degreesC for ca. 80 % of the time, and changes in the relative air humidity vary from -15 to 0 % for ca. 82 % of the time. The most important chamber effect is associated with the penetration of solar irradiance, which is reduced by 26 % compared to the open condition outside the domes. The dimensions of the domes are l Ox 10 m in length and 7 m high in the central part. The experiment was done in three identical stands of twelve-year-old Norway spruce trees. The 56 trees are planted at two different spacings to estimate the impacts of stand spatial structure in relation to EC.

AB The thrust of this study is to construct an MPLS test-bed using open hardware and software and later use this test-bed for experimenting various traffic engineering options available with MPLS. We have constructed a test-bed using Pentium PCs and Linux and used this test-bed to try a well-known MPLS traffic engineering feature of separating flows into multiple trunks. The. purpose of this separation is to experimentally assess the quality of service benefits we can expect from MPLS networks. We experiment with a hierarchical separation structure where the first level of separation is based on the transport layer used (TCP or UDP). This high level separation prevents UDP from unfairly grabbing the available bandwidth from TCP applications. Since different applications using TCP have different needs, e.g., some might want high bandwidth while others are more sensitive to packet delay, the second level of separation is based on application type. The results from our open experimental test-bed confirms the intuitive results by demonstrating better QoS with the flow separation in the MPLS core.

AB Modulation of cerebral GABA system plays an important role in suppressing migraine related events. Therefore the efficacy of anticonvulsants with GABAergic properties (valproate, gabapentin, topiramate) as well as of lamotrigine without GABAergic properties in migraine were studied. The different mechanisms of action, pharmacological properties, side effects, contraindications and clinical studies of these anticonvulsants are described. If there are contraindications for treatment: with beta -blockers or flunarizine, valproate or gabapentin can be used as an alternative therapy in migraine prophylaxis. Topiramate seems to be effective, but further large double-blind placebo-controlled studies are necessary for confirmation. Regarding the published studies for lamotrigine the efficacy in migraine is uncertain. It is possible only effective to prevent migraine aura. In acute treatment of migraine attacks intravenous valproate was effective in two small studies with open design. Therefore intravenous valproate may be an alternative treatment in intractable migraine attacks.

AB Background. MRI-guided procedures have previously been limited by technical difficulties, including the need for MRI-compatible instruments, slow image acquisition time, and the closed nature of conventional MRI scanners. The development of open configuration MRI systems with in-room, contemporaneous imaging has greatly increased the potential for MRI-guided interventional procedures. We evaluate our clinical experience applying this technology to the head and neck.
   Methods. An open design 0.2T magnet combined with an in-room monitor was used for 24 MRI-guided needle localization procedures in the head and neck. Success of the procedures was based on the ability to accurately position the instrument in the target region to allow biopsy or treatment.
   Results. In all 24 cases placement of the instrument within the target tissue was successful.
   Conclusion. MRI-guided needle-localization procedures in an open design magnet with in-room, contemporaneous image monitoring offer advantages over previous conventional interventional MRI systems by allowing interactive guidance with near real-time imaging feedback. As a result, procedure time is reduced and accuracy of instrument positioning is increased. (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB OBJECTIVE: the purpose of this report is to analyze the results of a 1-year clinical study of antioxidant therapy in the treatment of pain and recurrent inflammatory episodes in patients with chronic and acute recurrent pancreatitis, using a prospective, descriptive, pre-post, open design. The intensity of pain at the beginning and end of treatment was assessed with a visual analogue scale, and these results along with the number of hospital admissions for pancreatic disease were analyzed.
   METHODS: we studied patients with acute recurrent or chronic pancreatitis who had suffered from pain or acute inflammatory episodes the year before the beginning of treatment with a complex containing L-methionine, beta-carotene, vitamin C, vitamin E and organic selenium.
   RESULTS: of 10 patients with chronic pancreatitis who completed treatment, the intensity of pain was reduced considerably in 9 (61.5 +/- 21.5 mm vs. 19.6 +/- 26.1 mm, p = 0.03), and pain was completely absent in 3 of these patients. Twelve patients who completed treatment had fewer hospital admissions during the year with antioxidant treatment than they had had during the previous year (1.5 +/- 1.62 vs. 0.25 +/- 0.45 admissions, p = 0.03).
   CONCLUSIONS: antioxidant treatment had a positive effect in patients who suffered from pancreatic inflammatory pain, and its effectiveness should be tested before more aggressive and costlier treatments are considered.

AB Current evidence suggests that angiotensin II may be involved in the regulation of renal erythropoietin (EPO) production. The present study assessed the role of angiotensin II (A II) in different doses in the control of EPO production in humans. In a parallel, randomized, placebo-controlled open design, 60 healthy male volunteers received a 6-h intravenous infusion of: placebo (placebo, electrolyte solution), a presser dose of A II (1-3 mu g/min; A II press), a combination of a presser dose of A II and the selective AT(1)-receptor blocker losartan, 50 mg (A II press + L), a subpressor dose of A II (0.0375-0.15 mu g/min; A II subpress) and a combination of a subpressor dose of A II and losartan (A II subpress + L). A II press treatment resulted in a significant increase of the maximum EPO concentration (C-maxEPO, 41% higher versus placebo) and the amount of EPO produced in 24 h (AUC(EPO(0-24 h)), 61% larger versus placebo), A II subpress treatment increased C-maxEPO (35% higher versus placebo) and AUC(EPO(0-24 h)) (34% larger versus placebo). A II press + L and A II subpress + L treatments did not significantly increase C-maxEPO and AUC(EPO(0-24 h)) compared to placebo. A II affects EPO production in a dose-dependent manner. The signal seems to be mediated via ATI-receptors. A II appears to be one modulator EPO production in humans.

AB Background: Accumulating evidence shows the efficacy of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(B)) receptor agonist baclofen in reducing alcohol intake in rats, but no studies have been performed in alcoholics. In the present preliminary study we investigated the effect of short-term baclofen administration on craving for alcohol, ethanol intake, and abstinence from alcohol in alcoholic individuals.
   Methods: Ten male current alcoholic individuals were admitted to the study. Baclofen was orally administered for 4 weeks, at a dose of 15 mg/day refracted in three times per day for the first 3 days, with the dose increased to 30 mg/day for the remaining 27 days. Each subject was checked as an outpatient every week for the 4 weeks; at each visit (T0-T4) craving level was evaluated by the Alcohol Craving Scale (ACS), and abstinence from alcohol was assessed based on the individual's self-evaluation family member interview, and the main biological markers of alcohol abuse. A self-reported alcohol intake was recorded as the mean number of standard drinks consumed per day.
   Results: Nine subjects completed the study; of these, two subjects continued to drink alcohol although they substantially reduced their daily drinks in the first week of treatment, whereas seven maintained abstinence throughout the experimental period. Craving was significantly reduced from the first week of the drug administration (p < 0.01) and remained so throughout the entire treatment period. Participants also reported that obsessional thinking about alcohol disappeared. Values of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, alanine aminotransferase, and mean cellular volume significantly decreased by the end of the study. Tolerability was fair in all participants; headache, vertigo, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, hypotension, increased sleepiness, and tiredness were present as side effects in the first stage of the treatment. No participants showed craving for the drug.
   Conclusions: With the limitations of the low number of individuals evaluated and the open design, this preliminary clinical study supports the preclinical evidence on the effect of baclofen in reducing alcohol intake. The anticraving properties of the drug suggest a possible role of baclofen in the treatment of individuals with alcohol problems.

AB Aims To establish whether enantioselective metabolism of racemic (rac)-salbutamol occurs in the lungs by determining its enantiomeric disposition following inhalation, in the absence and presence of oral charcoal, compared with that following the oral and intravenous routes.
   Methods Fifteen healthy subjects (eight male) were randomized into an open design, crossover study. Plasma and urine salbutamol enantiomer concentrations were measured for 24 h following oral (2 mg) with or without oral charcoal (to block oral absorption), inhaled (MDI; 1200 mu g) with or without oral charcoal and intravenous (500 mu g) rac-salbutamol. Systemic exposure (plasma AUC(0, infinity) and urinary excretion (Au-24h) of both enantiomers were calculated, and relative exposure to (R)-salbutamol both in plasma (AUC((R)-)/AUC((S)-)) and urine (Au(R)-/Au(S)-) was derived for each route. Relative exposure after the inhaled with charcoal and oral routes were compared with the intravenous route.
   Results AUC((R)-)/AUC((S)-) [geometric mean (95% CI)] was similar following the intravenous [0.32 (0.28, 0.36)] and inhaled with charcoal rates [0.29 (0.24, 0.36); P = 0.046], but was far lower following oral dosing [0.05 (0.03, 0.07); P < 0.001]. Similar results were found when relative exposure was analysed using Au-24h.
   Conclusions These results show no evidence of significant enantioselective presystemic metabolism in the lungs, whilst confirming it in the gut and systemic circulation, indicating that the (R)- and (S)-enantiomers are present in similar quantities in the airways following inhaled vac-salbutamol.

AB The Cuban Weather Radar Network is composed by 3 RC-32B (Japan) and 4 MRL-5 (Russia). In 1993 the Cuban Meteorological Service decided to mount a modernized radar prototype at Camaguey Meteorological Center, incorporating computer control and data acquisition hardware to achieve fully unmanned operation. Modernization of conventional weather radars is now possible within a small budget using open hardware and software architectures. Our Primary Processor "ELBRUS" (Signal Processor + Radar Controller) makes use of available computer cards and commercial PC systems. The system architecture was designed with a particular stress on software. All functions that could be handled within the Data Acquisition Computer have been put there. Also, a versatile Product Generator and Processing System were developed. Vests processor Vesta RPG and its front end application Vesta\Process deal with product and composite generation, data base management and web server links. They function in a server-client fashion using standard protocols. Results obtained with this prototype are now being extended to other 6 radars under a National Program for the modernization of the Cuban Weather Radar Network, which also includes composition and distribution of the products.

AB This paper presents the design of a precision electro discharge micro milling machine being designed and built in the Precision Systems Laboratory at the University of Kentucky. This machine will use micro electrodes to mill complex 3D cavities with electrical discharges between an electrode tool (cathode) and a workpiece (anode) submerged in dielectric fluid. The machine entails three axes of motion consisting of a pre-existing XY stage and a new Z stage with spindle. The objectives in designing this machine are to achieve high precision for large workpieces and to develop an open architecture machine controller for micro EDM. The CAD data documenting this machine design is available free through the Open Design Foundation. These solid models can be downloaded by any party, and they may be used, modified, or redistributed as long as the machine remains an Open Design. This paper presents two concepts for the new z-stage and spindle. One concept uses a flexure for fine motion during micro machining, and the spindle is held on a plate that is guided with air bushings to accommodate a range of workpiece heights. The second concept is a conventional vertical column with a head and spindle. The two concepts are compared using error budgets.

AB Aims In the Second European Stroke Prevention Study headaches associated with dipyridamole frequently (8% of patients taking dipyridamole or dipyridamole plus acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) vs 2% of patients taking ASA or placebo) led to discontinuation of therapy. We have now used data from a recent trial comparing the bioequivalence of two formulations of the fixed combination of 200 mg dipyridamole in an extended release formulation and 25 mg ASA to explore predicting factors for headaches associated with this drug combination.
   Methods The bioequivalence trial employed a two-way crossover, randomised, open design. Trial medication was given for two periods of five days separated by a 72 h washout period. Statistical methods were employed to explore the prevalence, the time course, and the relation to individual pharmacokinetic parameters of treatment associated headaches.
   Results Headache episodes, being mostly mild and transient, rapidly declined from 67% of the volunteers on the first day of treatment to 3% on the final days of treatment (days 4-5 of the second period). During the first days the prevalence of the headaches peaked 2-3 h after the morning administration, which coincided with the peak of the plasma concentrations of dipyridamole. The occurrence of headaches was not related to interindividual differences of the pharmacokinetic parameters.
   Conclusions The rapid decrease in the incidence of headaches over time implies that most patients quickly develop tolerance to dipyridamole-associated headaches. Appropriate information given to the patient when prescribing and dispensing dipyridamole/ASA may reduce early withdrawals from treatment and increase compliance.

AB Elevated blood cholesterol is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis. Recent studies show that lowering cholesterol reduces the risk of vascular disease, but the precise mechanisms for vascular improvement are not fully understood. Furthermore, it is not known whether the beneficial effects of cholesterol lowering extend to the skin microvasculature. In this unrandomized, open design study, we used iontophoresis and laser Doppler flowmetry to examine forearm skin perfusion in hypercholesterolaemic patients with PAOD before and after cholesterol-lowering therapy with fluvastatin.
   Endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilatation were measured following skin iontophoresis of acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP), respectively.
   Before cholesterol-lowering, vascular responses to ACh and SNP were reduced significantly in patients compared with responses in control subjects (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05, ANOVA, respectively). Fluvastatin therapy (40 mg/day) for 24 weeks significantly reduced total cholesterol (7.3 +/- 0.3 to 6.0 +/- 0.2 mmol/l, p < 0.001) and LDL cholesterol (5.4 +/- 0.5 to 4.2 +/- 0.4 mmol/l, p < 0.01). Vasodilatation to SNP was significantly improved at week 24 (p < 0.05).
   In patients with hypercholesterolaemia and PAOD, cholesterol-lowering with statin therapy significantly improved endothelium-independent vascular responses to SNP in skin microvessels. The application of the non-invasive techniques of iontophoresis and laser Doppler flowmetry may provide useful markers for the assessment of microvascular function in this group of patients.

DT Article
ID CALCIUM SUPPLEMENTATION; WOMEN; POSTPARTUM; DENSITY; RISK; MASS
AB Objective: To investigate variations in bone mineral density during lactation and throughout the 12 months after scheduled cessation of lactation in relation to the resumption of ovarian function.
   Methods: Three hundred eight mothers who decided to lactate were scheduled to fully breast-feed for 6 months, followed by a 1-month weaning period, and then suppress lactation with cabergoline. Their bone mineral density variations were compared with those of a control group of nonlactating mothers during the first 18 months postpartum. Half the lactating women were given daily oral calcium supplements of 1g in an open design.
   Results: There was a significant progressive decrease in bone mineral density in lactating women over the first 6 months, followed by recovery of bone mass up to levels that at 18 months were higher than baseline. In nonlactating women, bone mineral density increased progressively after delivery, and at 18 months postpartum had increased by 1.1-1.9% compared with baseline. Compared with lactating women who resumed menstruation within 5 months of delivery, breast-feeding mothers with longer amenorrhea initially lost more bone, but they also gained significantly more bone after resumption of menses, so there were no differences at 18 months postpartum. Oral calcium supplementation decreased bone loss, but had only a transient effect.
   Conclusion: A scheduled lactation period of 6 months, followed by a I-month weaning period, allowed bone mineral density to reach higher values compared with early postpartum, regardless of calcium supplementation and duration of postpartum amenorrhea.

AB Objective: To study the effect of octreotide on glucagon-like peptide 17-36) amide (GLP-1) and insulin secretion in patients with pituitary tumors during preoperative treatment and in healthy subjects.
   Design: Open design prospective clinical study
   Methods: Eighteen patients with pituitary macroadenomas (13 clinically nonfunctioning (NFA; 11/13 had GH insufficiency), 5 GH secreting (GHA)) received preoperative octreotide treatment: 3x100 mu g/day s.c, for 3 months, and 3x500 mu g/day s.c, for an additional 3 months, Seven healthy subjects received (for ethical reasons) only 3x100 mu g/day for 10 days, A standardized meal (St-hl) lest, oral glucose lest (oGTT) and i.v. glucose test (ivGTT) were done before octreotide therapy, on days 1, 2 and 3 (D1,2,3), after 3 months (M3) and 6 months (M6) of octreotide treatment in the patients, and before treatment, on D1.2.3 and on D8.9.10 of octreotide treatment in the healthy subjects, Serum CLP-I, insulin and GH as well as plasma glucose were determined for 180 min (oGTT, St-M) or 120 min (ivGTT).
   Results: Pretreatment fasting GLP-1 concentrations as well as integrated responses (area under the curve 0-180 min) to oGTT and St-M were not significantly different between NFA, GHA and healthy subjects, During the oGTT, octreotide initially almost abolished the early (0-60 min) and diminished the late (60-180 min) GLP-1 and insulin responses in patients and healthy subjects, At M6 integrated insulin responses had significantly recovered, while the increase in GLP-1 response failed to ranch significance (GLP-1: 56.5% of pretreatment at D2 versus 93.5% at M6 and 41.2 versus 63.1%; in NFA and GHA respectively: insulin: 50.2 versus 71.2% and 35.5 versus 70.4%). An escape of GLP-1 and insulin in healthy subjects (D2 versus D9) was not significant, Intestinal glucose absorption was apparently not reduced, since the early glucose rise was similar before and during octreotide treatment, During the St-M the GLP-1 and insulin responses were similarly suppressed by octreotide and recovered during ongoing treatment (GLP-1: 49.6% of pretreatment at D1 versus 79.0% at M6 in NFA and 46.9 versus 52.9% in GHA, Insulin: 27.6 versus 83.9% and 23.5 versus 54.4%). The escape was significant in NFA but not in GHA. In the healthy subjects the escape was already significant on D8 (GLP-1: 39.5% of pretreatment at D1 versus 68.3% at D8: insulin: 36.6 versus 53.8%). During the ivGTT GLP-1 did not increase, The early insulin response (0-30 min) was abolished by octreotide, followed by a reduced peak at 60 min, The reduction of the integrated insulin response during ivGTT was similar to that during oGTT, An insulin escape reached significance only for NFA (52.6% of pretreatment at D3 versus 66.7% at M6). Glucose tolerance (K-G value) deteriorated and did not improve during ongoing treatment,
   Octreotide suppressed the median GPI: concentration (8 h profile) of the GHA patients from 10.3 mu g/l (pretreatment) to 5.8, 6.3 and 3.7 mu g/l at D4, M3 and M6 with no escape. GH was 1.5 mu g/l postoperatively.
   Conclusions: Octreotide abolishes the early and diminishes the late GLP-1 and insulin responses to oGTT and St-hi in NFA and GHA patients and in healthy subjects. In contrast to GH, both hormones partially escape from suppression during ongoing therapy: During treatment with our conventional octreotide doses suppression of insulin secretion is maximal, Under these conditions an effect of the additional loss of GLP-1 is not apparent, Basal GLP-1 concentrations and integrated responses to oGTT and St-M were similar in healthy subjects and in patients with GH excess or GH insufficiency.

AB We assessed the clinical and biological effects of high-dose, long-term Naltrexone (NTX) treatment in 11 children (3-11 years), who had been diagnosed as autistic. The drug was given following an open design, for 12 weeks. beta-Endorphin (beta-END.) was assayed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells after 1 and 3 months of treatment, and 6 months after the completion of the course. Baseline beta-END levels were higher than in healthy age-matched controls. In seven patients treatment reduced beta-END, whose levels rose in four children. Autistic symptoms were considerably attenuated in all cases, with functional improvements involving several areas. There was a close correlation between the reduction in beta-END levels and the decrease of social withdrawal, and an evident - though weak - correlation between increases in beta-END and decreases in stereotypy and abnormal speech. Both effects persisted after treatment stopped. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V./ECNP. All rights reserved.

AB Although some studies suggest that asthma deteriorates after reducing inhaled steroids, results of long-term studies indicate that this might not be true for all patients. The aim of this study was to determine the utility of the detection of a plateau on the concentration-response curves to inhaled methacholine as a marker for safely reducing the dose of inhaled budesonide in asthmatic patients who are well-controlled with a moderately high dose of this inhaled steroid.
   A total of 46 patients with moderate asthma, well-controlled for at least 6 months by treatment with 800 mu g budesonide daily, were included in the study, Subjects were treated for a 2-week run-in period with their usual dose of budesonide. At the end of the run-in, all subjects were challenged with methacholine (0.095-200 mg.mL(-1)). Plateau responses, median effective concentration values, slopes and provocative concentration of methacholine causing a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) values were measured. For the subsequent 12 weeks, patients were treated in an open design with budesonide at a reduced dose (200 mu g once daily), and were asked to record their peak expiratory flow (PEF) in the morning and in the evening. In addition, asthma symptoms and use of rescue terbutaline were recorded in diaries.
   Plateaus were present in 24 patients, whereas 22 subjects showed concentration-response curves without evidence of a plateau, Ten patients in the nonplateau group deteriorated after reducing inhaled budesonide, compared to one patient in the plateau group (p=0.002). In the nonplateau group, FEV1 decreased from a baseline value of 3.28+/-0.19 L to 2.94+/-0.20 L at week 12 (p<0.0001). Like wise, morning PEF decreased fi om 419+/-19 L.min(-1) at baseline to 394+/-19 L.min(-1) at week 12 (p=0.02). By contrast, these variables remained unchanged in the plateau group.
   In conclusion, in asthmatic patients, well-controlled with a moderately high dose of budesonide, the detection of a plateau on the concentration-response curve to inhaled methacholine may be used as a marker for safely reducing the colticosteroid dose.

AB Background and Aim: Since functional properties in the vasculature of hypercholesterolemic subjects are impaired, a six-month pravastatin treatment (20 mg/die) was tested in an open design, on the impaired unstimulated forearm arterial compliance (Un-FAC((AUC))) of 14 asymptomatic type IIa familial hypercholesterolemic patients. In order to evaluate whether FAC((AUC)) changes might be related to the extent of cholesterol reduction achieved, this evaluation was carried out in five severely hypercholesterolemic patients, undergoing LDL-apheresis.
   Methods and Results: Arterial functional properties, ie FAC((AUC)) responses to glyceryl trinitrate (GTN-FAC((AUC))) and acetylcholine (ACh-FAC((AUC))), four patients) and the effects on rest and peak forearm blood flow and vascular resistance were evaluated on the non-dominant arm using plethysmographic methods, that also allow the direct assessment of the non-linear "compliance-blood pressure" curve. Selective LDL-apheresis was performed by using a dextran-sulphate column.
   Pravastatin effectively lowered plasma total (-16%, p=0.002) and LDL cholesterol levels (-22%, p=0.006 vs baseline). Rest and peak flow, basal and post ischemic vascular resistance were not affected as well as Un-FAC((AUC)) and GTN-FAC((AUC)).However, in the four hypercholesterolemic patients undergoing ACh infusion, there was an improvement in the ACh-FAC((AUC)) Of borderline statistical significativity (p=0.056). LDL-apheresis reduced plasma total and LDL cholesterol levels by 55% and 59%, without affecting blood pressure. In this series of five patients Un-FAC((AUC)) increased the Un-FAC((AUC)) rise being inversely related to the absolute reduction of plasma total (r=0.92, p<0.05) and LDL cholesterol (r=0.89, p<0.05) levels.
   Conclusions: In hypercholesterolemic patients a short-term hypocholesterolemic treatment with pravastatin, although able to improve the lipid profile, cannot alter significantly and GTN- blood flow vascular resistance, Un-FAC((AUC)) and GTN-FAC((AUC)). A possible selective improvement in the ACh-receptor-activated signal transduction pathway has been observed and the importance of a drastic reduction of cholesterol concentrations in order to affect the Un-FAC((AUC)) is suggested.

AB Purpose: A system for digital integration of an open MR scanner (0.23 T, Figure 1)in therapy simulation and 3D radiation treatment planning is described.
   Method: MR images were acquired using the body coil and various positioning and immobilization aids. A gradient echo sequence (TRITE 320 ms/24 ms) was used to create axial and coronal data sets. Image distortions were measured and corrected using phantom measurements (Figure 2) and specially developed software.
   Results: Maximal and mean distortions of the MR images could be reduced from 19 mm to 8.2 mm and from 2.7 mm to 0.7 mm, respectively (Figure 3 to 5, Table 1). Coronal MR images were recalculated in fan beam projection for use at the therapy simulator. Tumor and organ conturs were transferred from the MR image to the digitally acquired and corrected simulator image using a landmark matching algorithm (Figure 6 and 7). For 3D treatment planning, image fusion of axial MR images with standard CT planning images was performed using a landmark matching algorithm, as well (Figure 8). Representative cases are shown to demonstrate potential applications of the system.
   Conclusion: The described system enables the integration of the imaging information from an open MR system in therapy simulation and 3D treatment planning. The low-field MR scanner is an attractive adjunct for the radio-oncologist because of the open design and the low costs.

AB OBJECTIVE - To establish whether the short-acting insulin analog lispro can be successfully implemented in long-term intensive insulin therapy in type 1 diabetes, and if so, what its effects are on glycemic control and frequency and awareness of hypoglycemia.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - We randomized 56 type 1 diabetic patients to treatment with either lispro (n = 28) or human regular insulin (Hum-R; n = 28) as mealtime insulin for 1 year (open design, parallel groups). Lispro was injected at mealtime and Hum-R was given 10-40 min before meals (bedtime NPH was continued on both occasions). With lispro, NPH was added at breakfast (similar to 70/30), lunch (similar to 60/40), and supper (similar to 80/20) (mixing percentage of lispro/NPH) to optimize premeal and bedtime blood glucose.
   RESULTS - Total daily insulin units were no different in the two treatment groups, but with lispro similar to 30% less short-acting insulin at meals and similar to 30% more NPH was needed versus Hum-R (P < 0.05). The bedtime NPH dosage was no different. With lispro + NPH, the mean daily blood glucose was lower than with Hum-R (8.0 +/- 0.1 vs, 8.8 +/- 0.1 mmol/l; P < 0.05), HbA(1c) was lower (6.34 +/- 0.10 vs. 6.71 +/- 0.11%, mean value over 1 year: P < 0.002), and hypoglycemia (blood glucose less than or equal to 3.8 mmol/l) was less frequent (7.4 +/- 0.5 vs. 11.5 +/- 0.7 episodes/patient-month) and tended to occur mom within 90 min after meals than in the postabsorptive state (P < 0.05 vs. Hum-R). After 1 year, plasma adrenaline and symptom responses to experimental, stepped hypoglycemia improved with lispro and were closer to the responses of 12 nondiabetic control subjects versus Hum-R both in terms of thresholds and magnitude (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS - We concluded that mealtime injection of lispro + NPH improves the 24-h blood glucose and the percentage HbA(1c) as compared with Hum-R. The improvement can be maintained long term. Intensive therapy with lispro + NPH results in less frequent hypoglycemia and better awareness and counterregulation of hypoglycemia.

AB Many of the recent research and development activities have been focussing on designing a black liquor evaporator which is able to handle tough conditions such as scaling and high temperatures.
   Kvaerner Pulping is in continuous efforts to improve the evaporator equipment and evaporation process in order to meet modern pulp and paper industry demands for high availability, increased productivity, high solids capability and good segregation of condensates for reuse within the pulp mill.
   The new TUBEL(R) (TUBELements) evaporator incorporates the basic design of shell and tube with the black liquor flowing on the outside of the tubes according to the falling film principle. The heating medium, which is normally low pressure to medium pressure steam, condenses on the inside of the tubes.
   Since the first demonstration in the Joutseno mill in Finland in 1994, the new evaporator design has been applied in many cases from pre-evaporation to superconcentration (evaporation to high dry solids) of black liquor, for softwood and hardwood including eucalyptus black liquors generated in both batch and continuous kraft and sulphite processes.
   The main features of the TUBEL(R) design include :
   (a) mechanical rigid design, which allows the higher steam temperatures and pressures used in superconcentrators and also reduces the risk of mechanical failures,
   (b) an open design with black liquor on the outside of the tubes secures excellent cleaning ability,
   (c) built-in capacity increase capability of the very rigid tube elements by simply raising the steam pressure.
   Because of its compact design, the TUBEL(R) can be made to replace the internals of existing concentrators or evaporators. In such cases, the shell of the existing equipment can either be maintained or extended, to fit the required heating surface of the tube elements.

   CARDIOVASCULAR RISK
AB OBJECTIVE Many GH deficient (GHD) patients have impaired glucose tolerance and GH substitution in these patients has caused deleterious effects on glucose tolerance with hyperinsulinaemia, This further impairment of glucose tolerance might be due to an unphysiologically high dose of GH, Whether such a deterioration can be avoided by an optimal GH replacement dose is not known. In most previous studies, the GH dose was calculated according to body weight or body surface area and not adjusted according to the serum IGF-I response.
   DESIGN The study was of open design and investigations were performed before the start of GH substitution and after nine months of treatment, The GH dose was adjusted according to the response in serum IGF-I, and in patients with sub-normal serum IGF-I levels (all but two) we aimed for a serum IGF-I level in the middle of the normal range. The median GH dose at the end of the study was 0.14 IU/kg/week.
   PATIENTS Ten patients, eight males and two females, with childhood onset GHD were examined. Their median age was 27 years (range 21-28).
   MEASUREMENTS Overnight and 24-h fasting levels of glucose, insulin and IGFBP-1 were measured. Directly after the 24-h fast an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), with measurements of glucose, insulin and IGFBP-1 was performed. An intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) was performed after overnight fasting, Body composition was measured with bioimpedance analysis (BIA) and quality of life was assessed using a self-rating questionnaire, Qol-AGHDA.
   RESULTS After GH treatment, there were no significant changes in glucose tolerance, measured by overnight and 24-h fasting levels of glucose, insulin and IGFBP-1, an oral glucose tolerance test (after 24-h fasting) and an intravenous glucose tolerance test (after overnight fasting). Percentage fat mass and BMI correlated negatively with both the 24 h fasting IGFBP-1 levels and the IGFBP-1 responses after the OGTT, All patients decreased their percentage of fat mass measured by BIA [median -2.9%; range -1.0-(-6.6); P = 0.005]. The administered GH dose correlated negatively with the relative change in whole body resistance (r = -0.66; P = 0.04). All, but one of the patients improved their quality of life score after GH therapy.
   CONCLUSIONS In a group of young patients with childhood onset GH deficiency, 9 months of treatment with a low GH dose (median 0.14 IUlkglweek) caused no significant deterioration of glucose tolerance, The strong negative associations between BMI or percentage fat mass and IGFBP-1 suggest that serum IGFBP-1 is more closely related than insulin to body composition in GH deficient patients. It is important to consider which critical endpoints should determine the GH dose. We would suggest that, apart for normalizing the serum IGF-I level, another main endpoint should be normalization of, or at least avoidance of any deterioration in glucose tolerance.

ID SIALIDASE
AB Objective: The objective of these studies was to examine the clinical pharmacokinetics and safety of zanamivir, an influenza A and B virus neuraminidase inhibitor, when administered to healthy volunteers.
   Design: The safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of zanamivir administered by a number of routes were assessed in randomised, double-blind and placebo-controlled studies. The study of absolute oral bioavailability had an open design.
   Study participants: The participants in these studies were healthy male or female volunteers.
   Interventions: Zanamivir was administered as single or multiple doses by the intravenous, oral, inhaled (nebuliser and dry powder) and intranasal routes. Serum and urine samples were obtained for determination of pharmacokinetic parameters, and nasal washes and throat gargles were performed to assess drug concentrations in the nose and throat. Safety was evaluated by monitoring adverse events, vital signs and laboratory parameters.
   Results: Zanamivir was well tolerated at all doses by all routes; no serious adverse events were reported. The kinetics of zanamivir were linear with single intravenous doses up to 600mg, and there was no evidence of modification in the kinetics after repeated twice-daily administration. Approximately 90% of zanamivir was excreted unchanged in the urine. The elimination of zanamivir from the serum was a first-order process with a half-life of approximately 2 hours and, at 16L, the volume of distribution was similar to that of extracellular water. The absolute oral bioavailability of zanamivir was low, averaging 2%. After intranasal or oral inhaled administration, a median of 10 to 20% of the dose was systemically absorbed, with maximum serum concentrations generally reached within 1 to 2 hours. The median serum half-life ranged between 2.5 and 5.05 hours, suggesting that the elimination rate is limited by absorption. There was no evidence of modification in the kinetics after repeated inhaled administration.
   Conclusions: Zanamivir is a well tolerated drug. The low level of absorption of the drug after inhaled administration results in low serum concentrations, and therefore there is modest systemic exposure to zanamivir after inhalation. Zanamivir is not metabolised, and the potential for clinically relevant drug-drug interactions is very low.

AB The study was performed on 14 healthy volunteers in order to compare the pharmacokinetics and hence assess the bioequivalence of two different tablet formulations of diltiazem administered orally.
   The study was carried out after single doses (60 mg) and repented doses (60 mg three times a day for six days and 60 mg on the seventh day) according to a randomised, cross-over, open design.
   The pharmacokinetic parameters AUC(0-infinity) (ng h/ml), T-max (h) and C-max (ng/ml) were calculated for the two formulations after a single dose, while AUC(t1-t2) (= AUC for a repetitive dose interval or dosing cycle, ng h/ml) and PTF (peak trough fluctuation) were calculated after repeated doses.
   The bioequivalence assessment was the shortest 90% confidence interval for the ratio (difference) of expected medians in the respective bioequivalence range (0.80-1.20).
   The results of this study show that after either a single dose or repealed doses of test or reference formulations of diltiazem, the pharmacokinetics of the two formulations are similar. The ratios of AUC on day 1 (for single-dose treatment) and on day 7 (for repeated-dose treatment), and the corresponding 90% confidence intervals demonstrate bioequivalence between the two formulations of diltiazem within the accepted range of 0.80-1.20 (80-120 %).

AB An open design framework, which allows mixing asynchronous and synchronous circuit st)des, is presented. It is based on the development of a tool called "CHP2VHDL": which automatically translates CSP-like specifications (Communicating Sequential Processes) into VHDL programs. This work follows two main motivations, i) to provide the asynchronous circuit designers with a powerful execution/simulation framework, mixing high-level CSP descriptions, HDL programs and gate level descriptions, ii) to give to synchronous designers familiar with existing HDL-based top-down design flows the opportunity to include clockless circuits in their designs.
   An extension of the CHP language proposed by A.J. Martin is presented and its simulation-oriented features are discussed. The "CHP2VHDL" ti translator and its software environment are then described. Finally, a significant design experiment is considered to illustrate the efficiency, of the design framework.

AB A typical approach to address the problem of enhancing the diagnostic x-ray imaging process is the integration of a simulation package within the main line of research on the field, which will promote design and experimentation on the proposed new techniques. However, modelling the equipment and the underlying physical phenomena is a complicated procedure and a detailed realisation of it leads to extended pieces of software. Such sophisticated products are used extensively during the development phase of radiographic equipment by the manufacturing companies and are commercially unavailable. An alternative approach is to create a simple model that will initially implement only a small part of the overall functionality and will allow further incorporation of features as future extensions. Basic requirements for this approach are an open design philosophy and an appropriate definition of the initial model.
   The proposed model is strongly influenced by ray tracing. The geometric nature of such a description of the x-rays' behaviour originates from the fact that any phase related phenomena, as well as reflection and refraction, are practically absent from the image formation process. Consequently, various ray-tracing techniques, along with the overall methodology, may be adopted by the x-ray model, leading to the initial version of the x-ray imaging simulator in a relatively short period of time.
   The application generates x-ray images of objects commonly used in ray tracing, such as triangular meshes and voxelised objects. There are a number of potential uses for this minimal functionality, however, the dominant element is the extendibility that the package offers, mainly due to its object oriented structure.

AB In analogical problem solving, non-isomorphic source/target relations are typically only investigated in contrast to the ideal case of isomorphism. We propose to give a closer look to different types of non-isomorphic source/target relations and varying degrees of structural overlap. We introduce a measure of graph distance which captures the "size" of partial isomorphism between two structures and we present two experiments investigating the influence of different non-isomorphic relations on analogical transfer. In the first experiment we contrast transfer performance for isomorphic vs, source inclusive problems with high vs, low superficial similarity. In the second experiment we explore different types of partial isomorphisms: source inclusiveness, target exhaustiveness, and different degrees of source/target overlap. The results indicate that (1) transfer of isomorphs is not significantly influenced by superficial similarity but transfer of partial isomorphs is, and (2) partial isomorphs can be transferred successfully if the amount of structural overlap is at least as high as structurally differences. The experiments were inspired by some open design questions for the analogy module of IPAL (a computational model integrating problem solving and learning).

AB Low temperature depletion capacitance-voltage data, taken from a novel open design of surface superlattice fabricated on a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure, are compared with two theoretical models. These assume either that the Fermi level on the free semiconductor surface is pinned, or that the surface charge state is unaltered (frozen) when the superlattices are biased. The data are in much better agreement with the frozen surface model. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

ID SUPEROXIDE-DISMUTASE
AB The present study set out to define the possible effect of reduced glutathione (GSH), the substrate of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), a free radical inactivating enzyme, in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Thirty-two patients affected by definite ALS seen in our institution between August 1993 and July 1994 were admitted to the study. The effect of GSH was studied in an open, crossover, randomized study. GSH was given at the dose of 600 mg each day intramuscularly for 12 weeks. The patients, taken sequentially, were randomly assigned to two groups. The first group received the drug while the second received only symptomatic therapies for 12 weeks. After a week of washout, the second group received GSH and the first only symptomatic therapies for 12 weeks. The rate of progression of the diseases was compared in the two groups. Clinical evaluation included manual test for muscle strength, Norris scale, bulbar scale, and forced vital capacity (FVC) percent. No significant difference was found in the progression of ALS in the two periods, although a slight slowing of the disease progression rate was found during the period of treatment, probably related to the open design of the study. Our data do nor show any significant effect of reduced glutathione in modifying the progression of ALS.

DE Hypericum; fatigue; complementary medicine; pilot study
ID DEPRESSION; WORT
AB Fatigue is a common reason for consulting a doctor but there is no definitive treatment. Hypericum perforatum has been shown to reduce symptoms of fatigue in depressed patients. It therefore may have potential value as a remedy for fatigue of unexplained origin. This pilot study aimed to investigate the effect of Hypericum on fatigue in a small group of patients in order to formulate a hypothesis upon which a randomized controlled trial could be subsequently based. The study protocol followed an uncontrolled, open design. Twenty patients consulting their doctors complaining of fatigue were treated with Hypericum extract (3 x 1 tablet daily) for six weeks. Compared to baseline values, perceived fatigue was significantly lower after 2 weeks of treatment and reduced significantly further after 6 weeks. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were also reduced. Baseline scores suggested that nearly half the sample may have been depressed at the start of the trial which was possibly related to fatigue. These results suggest there is scope for conducting a randomized placebo-controlled trial to investigate the specific effect of Hypericum on fatigue and that the study design must take account of the role of depression in fatigue.

AB Frameless MR-guided procedures have had limited application using conventional closed magnets, due largely to the technical difficulties involved. As a result of in-room MR image-monitoring capabilities, new open-design magnets now allow frameless stereotaxis using contemporaneous imaging to guide more invasive procedures. We evaluate our clinical experience with this new technique. An open-design 0.2 T magnet (Siemens OPEN) combined with an in-room monitor was used for 33 frameless MR-guided procedures (aspiration cytology, biopsy, and/or treatment) in a variety of locations in the head, neck, spine, brain, pelvis, and abdomen. Success of the procedure was based on the ability to accurately position the instrument in the target region to allow biopsy and/or treatment. The open-design magnet allowed the physician to directly access the patient for frameless stereotaxis as the procedure was performed. The in-room monitor provided contemporaneous imaging feedback during the procedure for successful placement of the instrument in the target region. Twenty-eight biopsy and five treatment procedures were performed. In all cases the technique resulted in successful placement of the instrument within the target tissue to complete the procedure. MR-guided procedures using contemporaneous imaging frameless stereotaxis are possible in an open-design magnet with in-room image monitoring and offer exciting possibilities for further development.

AB Objective: To study the effects of the somatostatin analog octreotide on gastric mucosal function and histology during short-term (3 months) preoperative treatment in patients with acromegaly.
   Design: Open design clinical study.
   Methods: 10 patients were studied before treatment: with octreotide (pre-tx), on day 1 of 300 mu g octreotide/day (d300), after 1 week on 300 (w300), 600 (w600) or 1500 (w1500) mu g octreotide/day, and after an additional 2.5 months on 1500 mu g octreotide/day (M3). An 8 h gastrin profile was obtained and ambulatory intragastric 23 h pH-metry carried out at the indicated time points. Gastroscopy was performed at pre-tx and M3 and multiple mucosal biopsy specimens taken.
   Results: The mean serum gastrin concentration at first declined during octreotide therapy to a nadir at w1500, then recovered despite ongoing therapy (probably in response to reduced gastric acidity) and was similar to pre-tx values at M3 (mean+/-S.E. 87+/-26, 50+/-11 and 98+/-46 ng/l for pre-tx, w1500 and M3 respectively; P<0.05, pre-tx vs w1500). Gastric acidity had also declined at d300 (P<0.05, d300 vs pre-tx), then recovered (despite the increase in the octreotide dose), but declined again at M3 (mean pH (95% confidence interval): 2.4 (1.7-3.2), 3.3 (2.4-4.3), 2.6 (1.8-3.5, n=8) and 2.9 (1.6-4.2, n=7) at pre-tx, d300, w1500 and M3 respectively). The gastrin concentration at M3, although similar to pre-tx values, remained inadequately low for the reduced gastric acidity. The reduction in gastric acidity was marked during the daytime (0900-2200 h; P<0.01, d300 vs pre-tx and P=0.028, M3 vs pre-tx). However, while the stimulated postprandial gastric acid secretion was reduced at d300 (P<0.01, d300 vs pre-tx) and at M3 (n=7; P=0.027, M3 vs pre-tx), fasting and preprandial acidity was not affected. During the night, gastric acidity was reduced from 2200 to 0300h, but the reduction was less marked than during the daytime. Paradoxically, the physiological intermittent late nocturnal reduction in acidity ('pH peaks' (0300-0800 h)) was abolished rather than enhanced. No patient acquired new Helicobacter pylori infection. The mean gastritis scores for antrum and body (n=8, Sidney classification) increased marginally from 1.7 to 1.9 (chronicity) and from 0.7 to 0.9 (atrophy), while the activity score was slightly reduced from 1.2 to 1.0.
   Conclusions: Three months of preoperative octreotide treatment profoundly and persistently altered gastric mucosal function (gastrin suppression, reduced acidity), but caused only minor variations in the pre-existing gastritis scores.

AB The objective was to evaluate possible pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions for repeated nightly zolpidem dosing with fluoxetine. Twenty-nine healthy female volunteers (mean age, 25.6 years) received zolpidem (10 mg) and fluoxetine (20 mg) in the following open design: zolpidem on night 1 followed by 1 washout day, a daily morning dose of fluoxetine on days 3 through 27, and a morning dose of fluoxetine plus an evening dose of zolpidem on days 28 through 32, Plasma levels of zolpidem, fluoxetine, and norfluoxetine were determined at the transitions from one regimen to the next. Morning psychomotor tests were performed on days 1, 2, 28, 29, and 33. Steady-state plasma concentrations of fluoxetine/norfluoxetine were reached by day 24 of fluoxetine dosing. No significant differences in any pharmacokinetic parameters for fluoxetine and norfluoxetine were observed between day 27 and day 32. There were no significant differences in AUC, maximal plasma concentration, or time to maximal concentration parameters for zolpidem plasma concentrations among nights 1, 28, and 32. There was a statistically significantly increased t1/2 for zolpidem on night 32, compared with night 28 (3.64 and 3.29 hr, respectively). There were no significant differences in the next-morning Digit Symbol Substitution Test performance at any time in the study. Both zolpidem and fluoxetine were well tolerated alone or during coadministration. These findings indicate the absence of clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions between fluoxetine and zolpidem (five consecutive doses) when the drugs are coadministered to healthy women. Therefore, based on these observations, short-term cotherapy with fluoxetine (20 mg) and zolpidem (10 mg) appears safe.

AB BACKGROUND: Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of totally occluded coronary arteries is performed in a variety of clinical settings and for a variety of indications. Most commonly it is performed for relief of symptoms of myocardial ischemia. Studies have also suggested that PTCA of occluded arteries beyond the acute phase of myocardial infarction may improve left ventricular function even in the absence of objective evidence of ischemia. One of the major limitations of total occlusion PTCA is a high rare of reocclusion, reported to be as high as 40%. Recently, small studies have suggested that stenting may improve the long term outcome after PTCA of total coronary occlusions.
   OBJECTIVES: To determine in a prospective, randomized trial whether long term patency and clinical outcome following successful PTCA of a totally occluded coronary can be improved by the use of of a heparin coated stent.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two strategies once the guide wire had crossed the occluded segment of the target artery: PTCA alone, or PTCA followed by insertion of Palmaz-Shatz heparin-coated stent(s). Randomization was stratified according to duration of the coronary occlusion:;ix weeks or less, and more than six weeks. The primary end-point is failure of sustained patency (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction [TlMI] flow grade less than 3) at six months. Secondary end-points are change in minimal luminal diameter, target vessel revascularization at one year, cardiovascular events at one year, and change in global and regional left ventricular function.
   BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS: All 410 patients have been randomly assigned to the PTCA alone (n=208) or PTCA plus stent (n=202) group. Mean age was 58+/-11 years and 18% were female. Prior myocardial infarction had been documented in 67% of patients. The duration of occlusion was six weeks or less in 40% and more than six weeks in 60% of patients. In 64% of patients TIMI flow was grade 0 and in 36% it was grade 1.
   STUDY IMPLICATIONS: The trial will demonstrate whether the use of a heparin-bonded stent can improve long term patency and clinical outcome in patients undergoing clinically indicated PTCA of totally occluded coronary arteries. If a significant reduction in reocclusion and clinical events is demonstrated, the Total Occlusion Study of Canada (TOSCA) would offer a more effective long term revascularization strategy in future trials testing the open artery hypothesis.

AB Objective: To develop and implement a range of strategies to control rising drug expenditure in a teaching hospital.
   Method: A multidisciplinary team was established to survey drug use and to identify areas where drug wastage was occcurring. Once target areas were identified, strategies were developed and implemented and drug expenditure monitored prospectively.
   Results: Communication and education about optimum drug use, efficient drug handling and therapeutic drug substitution were identified as areas for action. Antibiotic prescribing, outpatient prescribing and expenditure on new drugs were identified as target areas for cost savings. Compared to previous years, the rate of increase in drug expenditure on antibiotics was reduced by over pound 5000, from a baseline of pound 552 278 over the study period compared to an increase of pound 65 984 for the previous corresponding period.
   Conclusion: We believe that despite the short-coming of the study, which adopted an open design without a control group, it demonstrates that effective cost-containment strategies can be implemented by multidisciplinary teams if they are given sufficient support by senior management.

AB Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of clonal disturbances with defective cellular differentiation. Vitamin D3 (VD) analogues can act on the differentiation and maturity of different cell lines. We studied the effects of VD on a series of patients with MDS in an open-design trial. Nineteen patients, 12 men and seven women, with MDS were included. Patients were 74.8 +/- 5.6 years (mean +/- SD), seven had refractory anaemia with ringed sideroblasts, five had refractory anaemia, one had refractory anaemia with excess of blasts and six had chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia. All the patients were in a low to intermediate risk group. Mean follow-up period was 26.21 months, range 9-75. Responders were defined as follows: granulocyte or platelet count increase by 50%, or haemoglobin increase of 1.5 g/dl or transfusion needs decrease by 50%. The first five patients received 266 mu g of calcifediol three times a week and the other 14 received calcitriol(0.25-0.75 mu g/d). Response was observed in 11 patients, In the calcifediol-treated group, one case responded, three were non-responders, and one showed progression. In the calcitriol group, 10 were responders (two with major response), and four were non-responders. No correlation was observed between baseline levels of vitamin D metabolites and the presence of response. No hypercalcaemia was observed. Treatment with vitamin D3 metabolites could induce a longstanding response of the haematological disturbance in some low-intermediate risk MDS patients without inducing hypercalcaemia.

AB The Internet was developed in 1965 for academic and military use. Thirty-one years later, it is regarded as the 'information superhighway with almost one billion computer networks and well over a billion users projected to be using the Internet by the end of the century [1]. In essence, the open design of the Internet, geared towards the ease of communication and rapid development, has led to a severe lax in system security. As new developments (for example, the world wide web) and application of information technology emerge, so do the possibilities of hostile attacks on local area networks (LANS) and wide area networks (WANs). Therefore, the security aspects of the Internet and the world wide web must be carefully scrutinized. This paper outlines the security aspects of network systems and the world wide web.

AB A new programmable radio platform (PRP) has been designed by ITT, and two of its significant features are a new frequency-hop modem and a general purpose processor. This manuscript describes a joint project to design and simulate a new channel-access protocol that is targeted for the capabilities of the modem. Our channel-access protocol exploits the improved modem design and a low bit rate voice codec to provide integrated voice and data communications in a military frequency-hop packet radio network. The protocols are implemented in OPNET, a computer aided design tool, and they will be ported to the general purpose processor in the PRP. We demonstrate that an open design for a radio system that uses general purpose processors allows new networking protocols to be quickly developed, tested, and implemented in actual hardware.

AB To be able to meet modern pulp and paper industry demands on the evaporation process for high availability, increased productivity, high dry solids capability, good condensate segregation and good economy Kvaerner Pulping have developed a new evaporation technology based on tube elements. The new TUBEL(R) evaporator incorporate the standard tube as its basic design element which gives it a very rigid but still light weight design. It works according to the falling film principle but with the black liquor on the outside of the tubes.
   Since the first demonstration in the Joutseno mill in Finland in 1994 the new evaporator has been demonstrated in a number of applications from pre-evaporation to superconcentration, for softwood and hardwood including eucalyptus black liquors generated in both batch and continuous kraft and sulphite processes. The major features of the new design are:
   Mechanical rigid design which allows the high steam temperatures and pressures that are used in superconcentrators and reduces the risk for mechanical failures.
   Very open design with black liquor on the outside of the tubes secures a very good cleanability.
   Built in capacity increase capability by the very rigid tube elements by simply raising the steam pressure.
   Very efficient condensate segregation with a secured counter-current steam-condensate plug flow in the tube elements.

AB This paper explores the commonalties of architecture and systems design, using the notion of open planning. The practice of open planning is explored as a way of preserving the strength and conceptual integrity of a design concept while at the same time keeping it open for evolving and changing requirements, and of interpreting and handling constraints in innovative ways. A small case of cooperative prototyping is used for examining in how far this notion of openness can be made fruitful for the design of computer systems. Four aspects are discussed: the role of inspirational objects, the relevance and difficulties of working along themes, extending the notion of placeholders to systems design, and the need for open and rich forms of communication.

AB SEMATECH, a US based consortium of ten major semiconductor manufacturers, is developing a comprehensive system for the design of ICs below .25 mu m, which exploits hierarchy, constraint directives, incremental processing, and concurrent design and analysis. This development of SEMATECH's Chip Hierarchical Design System (CHDS) includes major technological investments in algorithms for design planning, parasitic extraction, and signal integrity verification. The foundation of CHDS is an open design model and API upon which these tools are integrated. This model must support a number of critical requirements including:
   A data scope that includes connectivity, electrical data, physical data, and timing;
   Design hierarchy and incremental access to data;
   A central delay architecture;
   Efficient, application-selected views of the data.
   This paper introduces the Integrated Data Model technology being used for CHDS Beta development and its use as the basis for the design of an industry-open specification called the CHDS Technical Data Specification (CHDStd).

AB The development of minimally invasive surgical and interventional techniques has created a need for more accurate and sensitive image guidance and monitoring. Magnetic resonance imaging, with its superior soft tissue discrimination and multiplanar facilities, seems the obvious choice for an ideal image-guidance tool. Until recently, the employment of MRI in this role has been prevented by the physical constraints of conventional, closed-configuration machines. The problem has now been overcome by the development of an open design allowing both horizontal and vertical access to the patient in the scanner so that procedures can be performed concurrent with image acquisition. This configuration, together with the use of fast gradient echo sequences which can scan at speeds close to real time, means that a wide range of interventional procedures can be performed with on-line image guidance and monitoring. In addition, the versatility of the open design means that patients can assume physiological positions to allow dynamic joint imaging to be performed. This opens up a whole new field in the understanding of joint pathophysiology. This review article discusses these recent technological developments and their clinical applications. In particular, the potential role in guidance of biopsies, monitoring of thermal ablation techniques and applications in endoscopic surgery is outlined.

AB Mortality from community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is high in the elderly and in patients who have a number of underlying diseases, We evaluated the clinical efficacy of a new unusual combination, teicoplanin-ciprofloxacin, in comparison with ceftriaxone in the treatment of CAP severe enough to require hospital admission. The present multicentre (23 centres) study was an open, comparative, randomised trial using parallel groups, and was carried out according to Good Clinical Practice. All patients required admission to hospital for seven CAP, and all had a follow-up visit that included chest x-ray and a wide biochemical and, in some cases, microbiological profile. 240 patients were enrolled: 158 elderly (over 65 years), 82 with underlying disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary primary or metastatic cancer, congestive heart failure, ketoacidotic diabetes), and 71 previously pretreated with other antibiotics with no cure or improvement. 121 patients (mean age 68.4 +/- 15.5 years) were randomised to treatment with single-dose teicoplanin 400mg intravenously on the first day followed by 200 (37 patients) or 400 mg/day (84 patients) according to the severity of the disease, plus ciprofloxacin 500mg twice daily orally (TEICO group). 119 patients (mean age 68.9 +/- 12.1 years) were randomised to single-dose ceftriaxone 2 g/day intravenously (CEF group). The two groups were homogeneous with regard to gender, pretreatment with other antibiotics, underlying diseases or illness severity at enrolment. Treatment was given for 10.2 +/- 3.1 days in the TEICO group and for 9.6 +/- 3.3 days in the CEF group. Cure or improvement was observed in 85.1% of patients in the TEICO group vs 73.1% in the CEF group, while failures occurred in 5.8% (7 of 121) in the TEICO group, and 23.5% (28 of 119)in the CEF group (the remaining patients were not evaluable for various reasons). Thus, the combination teicoplanin-ciprofloxacin was associated with a failure risk four times lower than ceftriaxone therapy (p < 0.001). Tolerability was good for both treatment regimens.
   In conclusion, in spite of the limitations of our study (open design, no microbiological diagnosis) the teicoplanin-ciprofloxacin combination appears to represent a good approach to the empirical treatment of CAP in the elderly and in patients with underlying diseases.

ID CHRONIC NONMALIGNANT PAIN; MORPHINE; STATES
AB This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group study was designed to examine the analgesic efficacy and tolerability of a newly developed tramadol slow-release (SR) tablet in comparison with immediate-release tramadol capsules in patients with chronic low back pain which had persisted despite intervention with other pharmacological and/or nonpharmacological measures. 103 patients were treated with tramadol SR tablets twice daily (2 x 100 mg/day) and 102 patients with capsules 4 times daily (4 x 50 mg/day) over a period of 3 weeks. The medication in both groups (verum/placebo) was administered 4 times daily to ensure the double-blind character of the study ('double-dummy technique'). In case of insufficient pain relief the patients received 2 x 200 mg SR/day as an escape medication (open design). Daily pain intensity was assessed by patients on a 4-step verbal rating scale. At the end of the study retrograde assessment of analgesia was done by the patient using a 5-step classification. Sufficient pain relief could be achieved in approximately 60% of the patients (116 patients) who completed the 3-week treatment period. There was no difference in pain relief (SR 59% and capsules 59%) and in course of pain intensity between both groups. Furthermore, 30 patients (15.3%) were Satisfactorily treated with the escape medication. Adverse events were reported at a similar rate in both groups (54.4% with the SR tablet formulation and 52.9% with the capsules). The main adverse events were nausea (16.6%), dizziness (14.1%), vomiting (9.8%), tiredness (7.8%), diaphoresis (6.3%), headache (6.3%), constipation (6.3%) and dry mouth (6.3%). With the exception of diaphoresis, constipation and dry mouth, adverse events decreased in incidence during the study. The results confirmed the equivalence with regard to efficacy and tolerability of twice-daily administration of tramadol SR tablets compared with 4-times-daily administration of tramadol capsules.

AB We describe an open ring as a new design to the Zamorano-Dujovny (Z-D) stereotactic unit. The titanium base ring has an opening of 45 degrees that can be located in any chosen position. Imaging studies such as computed tomography, X-ray, positron emission tomography, digital angiography, and digital substraction angiography can be performed with the open stereotactic ring for multimodality image localization. Preoperatively and intraoperatively, this open design provides the anesthesiologist with an unobstructed pathway for airway management. During the surgical procedure, it facilitates approach to any intracranial lesion, including orbitozygomatic, combined supra-infratentorial, and others. During awake craniotomies it not only allows for easy airway management, but also provides good access to the patient's face for intraoperative evaluation of speech and visual functions. Accuracy and reliability of this unit were similar to results obtained with the original circular ring. This system can be used in conventional stereotaxis with the Z-D are, as well as a reference for intraoperative registration with any digitizer system. The open stereotactic unit is a relatively inexpensive, reliable, and easy-to-use solution for resections using conventional stereotaxis or interactive image guidance in any intracranial site.

AB Despite the increasing use of dry powder formulations in the ambulatory setting, there is a paucity of information on the efficacy of this therapeutic modality to treat acute severe asthma. In addition, studies that compared wet nebulization vs metered dose inhalers formulated with chlorofluorocarbon (CFCMDI) attached to holding chambers have yielded discrepant results. Thus, it is unclear which of the three delivery systems would elicit a superior bronchodilator response, particularly in patients with life-threatening asthma. In a prospective, randomized open design, we studied the response to inhaled albuterol (salbutamol) in 27 adult asthmatics presenting to the emergency department (ED) with an FEV1 <30% predicted. Subjects were treated with one of the following regimens (nine subjects in each group): group A, mean (SD) baseline FEV1 of 0.7 (0.2) L, received albuterol solution, 5 mg, via nebulizer (Puritan-Bennett Raindrop; Lawrenceville, Ga) impelled with oxygen (O-2) at 8 L/min; group B, baseline FEV1 of 0.6 (0.15) L, received albuterol, 400 mu g, via a CFCMDI attached to a 145-mL valved aerosol holding chamber (Aerochamber; Trudell Medical; London, ON); and group C, baseline FEV1 of 0.6 (0.17) L, received albuterol powder, 400 mu g, by another means (Rotahaler; Glaxo: Research Triangle Park, NC). All groups received the respective treatments on arrival in the ED, every 30 min during the first 2 h, and then hourly until the sixth hour. Clinical parameters and FEV1 were recorded on ED admission and 15 min after each dose of albuterol. At the time of ED admission, all patients also received continuous O-2 and one dose of IV steroids (dexamethasone, 8 mg). The total dose of inhaled albuterol administered during the 6-h treatment was 45 mg of nebulized solution in group A and 3,600 mu g of albuterol aerosol and dry powder in groups B and C, respectively. No significant differences were found in the population demographics, baseline FEV1, and arterial blood gas values on air. FEV1 improved significantly in all patients after the 6 h of treatment. The 6-h area under the curve FEV1 improved similarly with the three delivery methods despite differences in the total dose administered. No patient was discontinued during the trial or admitted to hospital and no evidence of cardiovascular adverse events was apparent in any of the study groups. These data support the view that the three delivery methods appear adequate to treat subjects with acute severe asthma.

AB In an increasingly complex sociotechnical world, collective practices are more and more important for accomplishing the work that needs to be done. Small-group interactions are key sites for building communities in which knowledge is a collective goal. This study investigated the nature of small group interactions among Grade 4-5 students and between these students and their teachers. From an extensive data source which includes videotaped lessons, formal and informal interviews with students and teachers, ethnographic observations, and children-produced artifacts, two case studies were constructed to illustrate general patterns representative for the interactional structures in this classroom. The study provides evidence for the interactive flexibility of students, the construction of culture, power, and norms in each interaction, and the distributed nature of students' artifacts which exceeds social construction. Traditional resources for data interpretation such as power or attention deficit disorder were not useful to predict student interactions and work.

TI Heartburn and dyspepsia: the utility of symptom analysis
SO ALIMENTARY PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS
LA English
DT Article
ID GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE
AB Patients presenting with dyspepsia and heartburn are a heterogeneous group and a more precise identification of the cause of the symptoms is a prerequisite for a rational treatment. The patient's history is the basic diagnostic tool. Therefore it is important to evaluate the utility of symptoms as a predictor of any organic disease, like peptic ulcer, or as a predictor of a favourable symptomatic response to a specific drug treatment, such as omeprazole. When the history alone was used to discriminate between peptic ulcer and non-ulcer dyspepsia half of the patients with endoscopically-confirmed active ulcer were misdiagnosed as not having ulcers. Furthermore, in two-thirds of the patients in whom a clinical diagnosis of peptic ulcer was made, this was not confirmed at endoscopy. Heartburn is recognized as a symptom of reflux oesophagitis, but most patients complaining of heartburn have no visible mucosal lesion at endoscopy. The predictive value of heartburn depends on its severity; one-half of patients with severe heartburn, in fact, have oesophagitis. When symptoms of reflux oesophagitis are used in a scoring system, the diagnostic sensitivity is about 50%, while the specificity is 34-85%, depending on the severity of symptoms. When a complete patient history is used as a predictor, the diagnostic value increases significantly. Patients with endoscopy-negative dyspepsia and heartburn are a common problem and acid inhibitory drugs are widely used to manage the disease. The rationale for prescribing an acid inhibitor in this situation is the assumption that the symptoms are acid-related, but this is only the case for a subgroup of these patients. Identification of those patients who have acid-related symptoms is possible using omeprazole as a diagnostic tool, either in an open design or in a placebo-controlled single-subject trial. When heartburn is a predominant symptom, 50% of the patients respond to the acid inhibitory treatment, while this is the case for only one-third of patients when heartburn is not the dominating symptom. It is important to identify symptoms that, when present, significantly reduce the likelihood of a specific diagnosis or condition. This is the case with the symptom of loose stools in patients with dyspepsia, where it reduces the likelihood of a symptomatic improvement during treatment with omeprazole. In conclusion, symptoms do not reliably predict the underlying disorder, whether this is an organic disease or endoscopy-negative dyspepsia. Clusters of symptoms or the more global clinical judgement seem to have a higher discriminative value compared with a single symptom.

AB The evolution of waste containment design practices in Australasia is proving somewhat sporadic, generally spurred by legal precedent in the USA and Europe, but with little in the way of a consistent approach by designers or regulators. As a result, the state of the practice is highly variable. In defining the state-of-the-practice it is evident that there is an enormous range of both engineering and operational practice. Recent major facilities have been subject to very much tighter design and management controls, generally modelled on USEPA practice and with co-disposal of hazardous waste now largely avoided in new facility planning. Older existing sites vary widely in design and operating standard and represent a major disparity in terms of development and operation costs : that is, new, fully engineered facilities compared with older sites.
   In Australia, the introduction of recent semi-prescriptive guidelines for landfill design has defined benchmarks which represent state-of-the-practice in that country. In New Zealand a more open design approval process is applied through the Resource Management Act (1991), but there is little in the way of an effective spur to upgrade existing facilities to a standard equivalent to the precedent landfills that have been consented through a full appeal process. This is the result of a variable approach and application of precedent by regulatory authorities and cost-driven reluctance to change on the part of many Territorial Local Authorities, with this group representing by far the greatest number of facility owners.

AB Magnetic resonance (MR) field strength is one of the key aspects to consider when purchasing MR equipment. Other aspects include the gradient. system, coil design, computer and pulse sequence purchase cost, local reimbursement policies, and current opinion within the medical community. Our objective here is to evaluate the decision-influencing aspects of the MR market, with a focus on some specific areas such as high resolution studies, examination times, special techniques, instrumentation, open design magnets, cost and reimbursement policies, academic and industrial interests, contrast media, clinical efficacy, and finally, clinicians' preferences. Certainly the advantage of high-field is a higher signal-to-noise ratio and improved resolution. With a high-field unit, higher spatial resolution images and higher temporal resolution images can be obtained. Typical imaging times needed, to produce clinically diagnostic images are about 3 times longer at 0.1 T than at 1.0 or 1.5 T. High-field-related advanced techniques, such as functional imaging, spectroscopy and microscopy, may become clinically useful in the near future. As long as there is an unlimited demand for MR examinations, it appears financially profitable to run a high-field system, despite the associated higher costs. However, if demand for MR becomes saturated, low-field systems will cause less financial strain on the reimbursement Organisation and service provider. Recent emphasis on cost containment, the development of interventional techniques, the increased use of MR for patients in intensive care and operating suites, the deployment of magnets in office suites, and the development of new magnet configurations, all favour the supplementary use of low-field systems. Hence, MR units of all field strengths have a role in radiology.

AB With the widespread applications of GPS and the ever changing and evolving GPS requirements and capabilities, both in the commercial and military markets, there is a need for a flexible open architecture GPS receiver that would support laboratory development testing of GPS receiver design concepts, integration schemes, and GPS applications. The experience of the Central Engineering Activity (CEA) GPS Laboratory at NRaD San Diego supports the need for such a receiver. The special investigations and R&D GPS projects conducted by NRaD frequently require novel integration or data collection capabilities. These would only be readily available in a flexible receiver with a high degree of adaptability to the laboratory's ever-changing needs. The GPS Integration Receiver-Programmable (GPS-PRO) receiver, which utilizes an open hardware and software architecture, provides the necessary flexibility to perform this function.
   The GPS-PRO uses Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) hardware, an open architecture for external sensors, external communications and control, digital control, open software architecture, functional breakout points, and an upgradable daughter board concept for application specific systems. Such a receiver configuration provides the flexibility to interchange or insert new hardware or software modules in order to evaluate their performance in a controlled environment or provide an integrated system solution. The GPS-PRO flexible (programmable) functionality allows for its use as a design tool for R&D and hardware in-the-loop testing, application specific tailoring for low cost, small size customer demands, while providing benchmark performance capabilities.

AB Treatment outcome in congenital adrenal hyperplasia is often suboptimal due to hyperandrogenism, treatment-induced hypercortisolism, or both. As a new approach, we hypothesized that the effects of androgen could be blocked by an antiandrogen (flutamide) and an inhibitor of androgen to estrogen conversion (testolactone), thus allowing the hydrocortisone dose to be reduced. We conducted a short term pilot study in 12 children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia in a randomized cross-over open design to determine whether flutamide, testolactone, reduced hydrocortisone dose, and fludrocortisone are more effective than hydrocortisone and fludrcortisone treatment in normalizing linear growth, weight gain, and bone maturation. Each regimen was administered for 6 months, with a 3-month washout period, consisting of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone treatment, between regimens. Compared to hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone treatment, the regimen of flutamide, testolactone, reduced hydrocortisone dose (from 12.9 to 7.9 mg/m(2) . day), and fludrocortisone produced an increase in plasma 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels (P < 0.05) and a decline in urinary cortisol (P < 0.01), Linear growth rate (-0.9 +/- 0.5 vs. 1.4 +/- 0.6 SD U; P = 0.003), weight velocity (-0.80 +/- 0.4 vs. 0.6 +/- 0.4 SD U; P = 0.01), and bone maturation (0.6 +/- 0.6 vs. 1.4 +/- 0.9 yr bone age/yr chronological age; P = 0.02). Although no important adverse effects were observed, the known potential for flutamide-induced hepatotoxicity made frequent monitoring essential. We conclude that the regimen of flutamide, testolactone, reduced hydrocortisone dose, and fludrocortisone improves the short term control of growth and bone maturation in children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Long term studies are required to determine whether this approach can improve these children's growth and development.

AB Background The acute coronary syndromes of unstable angina and non-Q-wave infarction are initiated by coronary plaque rupture and subsequent thrombus formation, Thrombin is central to this response as it activates platelets and the coagulation system. In an open design study we assessed the tolerability and safety of the low molecular weight thrombin inhibitor, inogatran, for unstable angina or non-Q-wave infarction.
   Methods Thirty-seven patients, treated within 72 h of symptoms, were allocated consecutively to groups to receive a 4 h infusion with one of three doses of inogatran. Thrombin generation and activity were measured with plasma markers at baseline, after the 4 h treatment period and 4 h later. Ischaemia was monitored using continuous vectorcardiography during the 4 h of treatment and during the subsequent 4 h after inogatran infusion had been stopped, to detect any increase in ischaemic events after the period of treatment, In addition, 12 patients received inogatran as an infusion for 72 h.
   Results Inogatran was tolerated well. There were no adverse haemodynamic effects or allergic reactions, Minor bleeding events were detected in 37% of the patients. The biochemical and vectorcardiographic findings indicated suppression of thrombin generation after the 4 h treatment period compared with baseline, During the first 4 h after inogatran treatment, thrombin activity and episodes of ischaemia were increased compared with during the treatment period.
   Conclusion Inogatran was tolerated well and was safe, but its discontinuation was followed by a reactivation of thrombin activity and ischaemia. Whether this reactivation represented a rebound phenomenon, or merely resulted from the discontinuation of an effective therapy, cannot be established from the present study.

AB We report a rf coil design based on the Alderman-Grant coil called th: modified Alderman-Grant. coil (MAGC), and demonstrate its efficacy in the magnetic resonance force microscope (MRFM). The rf field of the MAGC has a magnitude comparable to that of a solenoidal coil of similar size (for the same input power) but the coil has a much smaller inductance. This is advantageous in electron spin resonance MRFM experiments which would benefit from rf frequencies in excess of 1000 MHz. The open design of the MAGC is also advantageous because it provides superior access to the sample mounted on a mechanical cantilever by the optical fiber and permanent magnet and so allows the sample to be placed at the center of the coil.

AB We have built and tested a system that is capable of simultaneous molecular beam deposition and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) imaging at T=300-1000 K. The STM is based on the beetle-type design. Active compensation of thermal drift reduces the residual drift in the images to similar to 2 Angstrom/min at 850 K sample temperature. Measurements at varying sample temperatures are also feasible. Due to the open design of the STM, a molecular beam from a commercial microevaporator is aimed between tip and sample. With our system, simultaneous molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and STM experiments during growth at high temperature are feasible. This method (MBSTM) provides the possibility to follow the MBE growth process with the STM in a real in situ way. The operation characteristics and performance of this instrument will be shown using examples of silicon homoepitaxy and Ge/Si heteroepitaxy. (C) 1996 American Institute of Physics.

TI An experimental multi-agent environment for engineering design
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COOPERATIVE INFORMATION SYSTEMS

DT Article
AB Real world engineering design projects require the cooperation of multidisciplinary design teams using sophisticated and powerful engineering tools. The individuals or the individual groups of the multidisciplinary design teams work in parallel and independently often for quite a long time with different tools located on various sites. In order to ensure the coordination of design activities in the different groups or the cooperation among the different tools, it is necessary to develop an efficient design environment. This paper discusses a distributed architecture for integrating such engineering tools in an open design environment, organized as a population of asynchronous cognitive agents. Before introducing the general architecture and the communication protocol, issues about an agent architecture and inter-agent communications are discussed. A prototype of such an environment with seven independent agents located in several workstations and microcomputers is then presented and demonstrated on an example of a small mechanical design.

TI Risperidone in the treatment of mania
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHIATRY

DT Article
ID SCHIZOPHRENIA; HALOPERIDOL; DISORDERS
AB Background: Risperidone, a 5-HT2 and D, antagonist, has been shown to be an effective antipsychotic in the treatment of schizophrenia but has unclear efficacy in the treatment of psychotic affective disorders. The purpose of the study was to assess the efficacy of risperidone in the treatment of acute mania with psychotic features.
   Method: We conducted an open-label pilot study of risperidone and concurrent mood-stabilizing drugs in the treatment of acute mania with psychotic features. Patients were diagnosed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID). Efficacy was measured weekly with the use of the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS).
   Results: Ten women and 5 men (mean age = 38 years) were included in the study. Of the 13 patients who completed 2 weeks of treatment, 8 of these 13 had a 50% improvement of the BPRS, and all 13 had at least a 25% improvement (p = .002, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 46.0 to 57.8). Of the 8 patients who completed 6 weeks of treatment, 7 of the 8 had a 50% improvement, and all 8 had a 25% improvement (p = .012, 95% CI = 52.4 to 69.3). Similar results were obtained with the YMRS. By the second week of treatment, 10 of the 13 patients remaining in treatment had at least a 50% improvement, and 12 of these 13 had a 25% improvement (p = .002, 95% CI = 55.1 to 89.9). By the sixth week, all of the 8 patients remaining in treatment had a 75% improvement (p = .012, 95% CI = 90.5 to 102.8). The medication was well tolerated, and no case worsened.
   Conclusion: When used with concomitant mood-stabilizing drugs, risperidone may be effective and well tolerated in patients with acute mania with psychotic features. Considering the open design, small sample size, and limited period of observation, further studies need to be conducted.

ID DEPRESSION; DISORDER; SLEEP
AB Since early treatment of depression with Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) can be associated with insomnia, daytime antidepressive therapy with SSRI is often combined with nighttime administration of a hypnotic. This study attempted to evaluate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between zolpidem 10 mg, a short-acting hypnotic, and fluoxetine 20 mg, an SSRI. Twenty-seven healthy male volunteers (mean age 23.5 years, range 20 - 29) received zolpidem and fluoxetine in the following open design: zolpidem on night 1, a morning dose of fluoxetine daily from day 2 through day 18 and zolpidem on night 18. Using HPLC, plasma levels of zolpidem, fluoxetine, and norfluoxetine were determined throughout night 1 for zolpidem, night 18 for zolpidem, fluoxetine, and norfluoxetine on days 16 and 17 for fluoxetine and norfluoxetine. Morning psychomotor tests were performed on days 1, 2, 18, and 19. Statistical analysis of data consisted of repeated measures of ANOVA. There was no significant difference in AUC, C-max, and T-1/2 of zolpidem plasma concentrations between night 1 (zolpidem) and night 18 (zolpidem and fluoxetine). There was a significantly higher zolpidem plasma level at 0.5 hours after dosing together with a significantly shorter T-max on night 18 compared to night 1. There was no significant difference in C-min of plasma fluoxetine and norfluoxetine levels between day 16 and 17 of fluoxetine dosing, and there was no difference in T-max between day 17 (fluoxetine) and day 18 (fluoxetine and zolpidem). There was a 3 - 4% increase in AUC and C-max of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine plasma concentrations in the presence of zolpidem. There was no difference in the next morning performance tests after nighttime treatment of zolpidem alone after 17 consecutive days of fluoxetine treatment, or after zolpidem in the presence of steady-state plasma concentrations of fluoxetine. Both zolpidem and fluoxetine were well tolerated alone or in combination. It is concluded that the onset of action of zolpidem may possibly be shortened in the presence of fluoxetine, but no other significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions occurred between zolpidem and fluoxetine.

ID PRESSURIZED AEROSOL INHALERS; ASTHMA; INHALATION; THERAPY
AB Pharmacists must ensure that patients know how to make the best use of their medication. An education programme was initiated in the southernmost part of Sweden during 1990 in order to improve the communication skills of pharmacy staff and the information given to customers. Customers with prescriptions for Turbuhaler(R) were asked to 'show-and-tell' how they used their inhalers, and the results were documented. In April 1992, 53% of patients handled their Turbuhaler(R) correctly. One year later a significantly higher proportion of the patients (67%) used their inhalers correctly. If patients are asked to 'show-and-tell' how they use their medication and how they interpret the information given, then errors in their handling of the medicines can be revealed. If advice on the proper use of drugs is given to individual patients, then mishandling is reduced. The study used an open design, so the conclusions drawn can only be tentative. However, the magnitude of the change observed suggests that the conclusions are valid.

AB A dose-ranging study of the use of oral naloxone in opioid-related constipation in patients with far-advanced cancer is reported. Naloxone doses were calculated as a percentage of the morphine dose each patient was receiving. Seventeen patients entered the first phase of the study, which had a randomised, double-blind design. Outcome measures were small bowel transit time (SBTT) measured by the lactulose/hydrogen breath test, pain scores and the occurrence of adverse events.
   One subject was excluded before receiving naloxone. No significant difference between placebo and naloxone occurred in the 14 remaining patients receiving total daily doses of naloxone 10% or less of the 24 h dose of morphine. Two further patients experienced a marked laxative effect with naloxone at 20% of the 24 h dose of morphine. In one of these, SBTT was available and was unchanged from placebo. The other declined to continue with SBTT measurement.
   Phase two of the study had an open design, in which laxative effects were determined clinically. Naloxone at a maximum dose level of 20% was given to seven patients, up to 40% to two patients and up to 80% to one patient. Four out of the seven patients in the 20% dose level group, and all of the remainder, experienced laxative effects. Two patients experienced symptoms of opioid withdrawal, one of whom also had return of pain.
   It is concluded that oral naloxone at a daily dose of 20% or more of the prevailing 24 h morphine dose is a potentially valuable therapy for opioid-related constipation. However, opioid withdrawal was observed and it is suggested that initial individual naloxone doses should not exceed 5 mg. Further research is needed into the oral absorption of naloxone, as well as further studies of clinical efficacy and dosing.

AB Background: Twenty-four-hour serum cortisol secretion is a sensitive parameter for the assessment of the pituitary-adrenal function of asthmatic children treated with inhaled corticosteroids. This study was undertaken to determine Ae effect of the long-term administration of inhaled budesonide on 24-hour cortisol production in young children with asthma.
   Methods: We studied II children, aged 7 to 12 years, with severe perennial asthma. All had been receiving 100 mu g of inhaled budesonide twice daily, administered with a spacer device, for 3 to 5 years. Serum cortisol concentration was measured at 8:00 AM, 60 minutes after intravenous administration of 0.25 mg of corticotropin, and every 30 minutes for 24 hours in an open-design study. Urinary cortisol secretion was measured by 24-hour urine collection. All determinations were made with a radioimmunoassay kit.
   Results: The individual morning serum cortisol concentration and the serum cortisol concentration at 60 minutes after corticotropin stimulation were within normal limits in all children. The 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion was also normal. The individual 24-hour serum cortisol concentration showed a normal pattern in all children, with no evidence of nocturnal suppression of serum cortisol concentration.
   Conclusion: Prolonged (3 to 5 years) administration of 200 mu g/day of inhaled budesonide in young children with severe asthma does not impair pituitary-adrenal function, even according to the sensitive test for 24-hour serum cortisol secretion.

AB The use of combinations of second line antirheumatic agents (SLAs) is increasing. There are several reasons for combination therapy, e.g. the unsatisfactory effects of single therapy. Strategies for combining SLAs are to begin with combinations, or to add one or more agents to another. The strategy of adding one agent to another is illustrated by a study of 40 patients having insufficient effect from sulphasalazine (SASP). Patients were randomized between methotrexate (MTX) and the combination of SASP and MTX. The patients were evaluated by a single observer in an open design. The follow-up was 24 weeks. The mean decrease in disease activity score was significantly greater and occurred earlier in the combination group. This favourable response was also present in the other efficacy variables. The incidence of toxicity was equal in both groups. These results support the strategy of adding MTX to SASP when combining these second line antirheumatic drugs.

LA English
DT Article
AB This study investigated the infiuence of a conditioned rare environment per se on bacterial colonization of burn wounds. Two cohorts of burn patients were treated in the successive years 1992 and 1993, the first group in a (permanent) purpose-designed unit and the second in wards of traditional 'open' design, during renovation of the unit. Patients who were admitted to the permanent and temporary units numbered 224 and 231 respectively, the groups being similar in features that generally influence the course and outcome of burn injuries. The principles and practice of treatment by the burn care team remained the same in both years. No significant difference in wound colonization rates was found between the two groups. We conclude that while the other known advantages of managing burn patients in purpose-designed units remain valid a conditioned care environment per se does not influence bacterial colonization rates of burn wounds.

Thirty-one patients with recent onset polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) were randomly assigned to deflazacort (n = 16) or 6-methylprednisolone (n = 15), according to a 2 period (duration of each period = 6 weeks), crossover, open design for comparing 2 dose regimens (daily vs alternate day), and according to a between-patients, double blind design for comparing the therapeutic effects of the 2 glucocorticoids (deflazacort vs 6-methylprednisolone). The patients, either during alternate day or daily regimen, were treated with fixed oral doses for the first 2 weeks (assuming a potency ratio deflazacort/6-methylprednisolone of 1.5 mg/1.0 mg: deflazacort 24 mg or 6-methylprednisolone 16 mg, daily; deflazacort 48 mg or 6-methylprednisolone 32 mg, alternate day), and with titrated doses for the next 10 weeks.
   Results. Two patients dropped out during the first 6 week period. The time course and extent of the improvement of disease activity indices (limb-girdle pain, morning stiffness, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and plasma fibrinogen) were not statistically different under the 2 regimens. The satisfactory equivalent glucocorticoid response observed in 12 pairs of patients treated with deflazacort and 6-methylprednisolone progressed significantly from baseline to the end of the study, under daily or alternate day regimen, with no significant difference between the 2 glucocorticoids. Deflazacort proved less potent than 6-methylprednisolone (1.78 mg: 1.0 mg minimum effective daily dose; 1.68: 1.0, alternate day), but equally effective.
   Conclusion. The 2 dose regimens, 6-methylprednisolone and deflazacort showed no significant differences in terms of efficacy during the short term treatment of PMR. Deflazacort proved less potent than initially estimated.

AB A multi-centre study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of fluoxetine in two groups of major depression : ''agitated-anxious'' and ''blunted-retarded''. The study included 50 patients presenting a major depressive episode (following DSM III-R criteria and score greater than or equal to 20 on MADRS) : 26 in ''agitated-anxious'' group (score greater than or equal to 15 on Hamilton anxiety scale and greater than or equal to 10 on Tyrer anxiety brief scale) and 24 in the ''blunted-retarded'' group (score greater than or equal to 15 on Widlocher retardation scale and greater than or equal to 10 on Abrams-Taylor blunted affect scale). After one week period on placebo, all patients were treated in an open design with fluoxetine at a fixed daily dose of 20 mg and followed on a period of 6 weeks with active treatment.
   In spite of a significant antidepressant efficacy of fluoxetine in the two groups, better results were observed in the ''agited-anxious'' depressed group : marked improvement on MADRS fetal score at day 42 (76 % decrease vs 62 % in the ''blunted-retarded'' group, p = 0,012), greater number of ''responders'' defined by a decrease greater than or equal to 50 % on MADRS total score and a total score less than or equal to 12 (95 % vs 63 %, p = 0,04), better patient's global impression on efficacy (54 % of ''excellent efficacy'' vs 18 %, p = 0,012), more improvement on HSCL-58 fetal ''score (mean decrease of 69 % vs 39 %, p = 0,016), higher improvement on ''hostility/interpersonal hypersensitivity'' score (mean tacks/irritability ''sub-score (mean decrease of 74 % vs 37 %, p = 0,001) and on ''anger attacks/irritability'' sub-score (mean decrease of 73% vs 30 %, p = 0,0002).
   The tolerance evaluation showed that side effects were reported equally in the two groups (respectively 31 % vs 33 %). 80 % of the ''agited-anxious'' group reported good global tolerance vs 52 % in the other group (P = 0,07).
   Our results are consistent with other publications showing that fluoxetine produces a clinically significant anxiolytic, anti-hostility and anti-impulsivity effects in major depression. Finally, our results supported a dimensional dichotomy separating between ''agitated-anxious'' and ''blunted-retarded'' forms of major depression.

DE TERMINALIA ARJUNA; CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE; CARDIOMYOPATHY; MEDICINAL
   PLANT
AB Twelve patients with refractory chronic congestive heart failure (Class IV NYHA), related to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (10 patients); previous myocardial infarction (one patient) and peripartum cardiomyopathy (one patient), received Terminalia Arjuna, an Indian medicinal plant, as bark extract (500 mg 8-hourly) or matching placebo for 2 weeks each, separated by 2 weeks washout period, in a double blind cross over design as an adjuvent to maximally tolerable conventional therapy (Phase I). The clinical, laboratory and echocardiographic evaluation was carried out at baseline and at the end of Terminalia Arjuna and placebo therapy and results were compared. Terminalia Arjuna, compared to placebo, was associated with improvement in symptoms and signs of heart failure, improvement in NYHA Class (Class III vs. Class IV), decrease in echo-left ventricular enddiastolic (125.28 +/- 27.91 vs. 134.56 +/- 29.71 ml/m(2); P < 0.005) and endsystolic volume (81.06 +/- 24.60 vs. 94.10 +/- 26.42 ml/m(2); P < 0.005) indices, increase in left ventricular stroke volume index (44.21 +/- 11.92 vs. 40.45 +/- 11.56 ml/m(2); P <;)0.05) and increase in left ventricular ejection fractions (35.33 +/- 7.85 vs. 30.24 +/- 7.13%; P < 0.005). On long term evaluation in an open design (Phase II), wherein Phase I participants continued Terminalia Arjuna in fixed dosage (500 mg 8-hourly) in addition to flexible diuretic, vasodilator and digitalis dosage for 20-28 months (mean 24 months) on outpatient basis, patients showed continued improvement in symptoms, signs, effort tolerance and NYHA Class, with improvement in quality of life. One patient died of cerebrovascular accident while another had sudden cardiac death, 16 months and 14 months after entry into Phase II, respectively. No significant clinical untoward effect occurred during Terminalia Arjuna or placebo therapy. The mechanism of beneficial effects of Terminalia Arjuna needs evaluation but it could be related to one or more of the constituents which have cardiotonic (glycosides) or free radicle scavenger (tannins, flavones) properties. In conclusion, adjuvent Terminalia Arjuna therapy in our patients with refractory congestive heart failure, mostly related to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, appeared safe and caused long lasting improvement in symptoms and signs of heart failure along with improvement in left ventricular ejection phase indices with definite improvement in quality of life. We believe that these preliminary observations open a new vista for future research in therapy of myocardial failure.

TI THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CERVICAL HALO - OPEN VERSUS CLOSED RING - A

SO PARAPLEGIA
LA English
DT Article
DE HALO CERVICAL ORTHOSES; SPINAL STABILIZATION
AB The halo cervical orthosis has proven extremely effective in stabilizing the spine, both non-operatively and as a supplement to operative procedures. Current designs of the available halo utilize either a closed or an open stabilizing ring. Twenty-four patients with various indications for halo application are reviewed. Eleven were treated with a closed ring apparatus (Ace Medical, Los Angeles, California), and thirteen with an open ring device (Bremer, Inc, Jacksonville, Florida). X-rays of the treated patients were compared by group, and patients were interviewed regarding their complaints while wearing the halo. Rates of complication were compared. Results showed no significant differences between radiographs (kyphosis or translation) throughout the follow-up period. Patients experienced a significantly higher incidence of halo-associated pain in the open group. Otherwise, there were no statistical differences in the complication rates of either device. Whether or not the higher incidence of pain in the open group is related to decreased device rigidity is unknown. The open design may theoretically permit bending and opening of the ring to occur, the so-called 'wishbone' effect. Based on these data, it cannot be determined whether the advantages of the open ring - ease of application - are offset by this potential disadvantage. Clearly, a larger, randomized prospective study is required to investigate this.

TI THE EFFICACY OF SUMATRIPTAN IN THE ACUTE TREATMENT OF MIGRAINE
SO HEADACHE QUARTERLY-CURRENT TREATMENT AND RESEARCH
LA English
DT Review
ID SUBCUTANEOUS SUMATRIPTAN; HEADACHE; LIFE
AB Objective: To review the clinical efficacy of sumatriptan as an acute treatment for migraine.
   Data sources: Published clinical trials with subcutaneous sumatriptan 6mg and oral sumatriptan 100mg.
   Study selection: Short-term clinical trials were randomized, double-blind, placebo- or comparator-controlled and parallel group in design. Trial design and methodology were uniform to allow meaningful comparisons of data between the trials. Long-term trials were of multinational, open design.
   Data extraction: All efficacy endpoints were assessed by the patients. The primary endpoint was headache relief (defined as an improvement from severe or moderate headache before, to mild or no headache at specific time points after treatment). Patients also assessed associated non-headache migraine symptoms, functional impairment, need for additional medication, and their ratings of treatment efficacy. Nonparametric statistical tests were used to analyze the primary and most secondary endpoints. Where appropriate, parametric methods were used with some secondary endpoints.
   Data synthesis: Subcutaneous sumatriptan 6mg and oral sumatriptan 100mg exhibited optimal efficacy and safety profiles in dose-defining trials. Sumatriptan relieved rapidly the acute symptoms of migraine attacks. Headache relief occurred from 10 minutes following subcutaneous injection and 30 minutes after oral sumatriptan administration, with maximal relief after a single dose occurring at 2 hours and 4 hours respectively. Headache recurrence, reported by approximately one-quarter to one-third of patients initially responding to this treatment, was effectively treated by a further dose of sumatriptan. Efficacy was maintained during the repeated intermittent longterm use of sumatriptan. Headache relief following sumatriptan was similar in the treatment of migraine with and without aura, and in menstrual and early-morning migraine attacks. Relief was also similar when sumatriptan was given early (within 4 hours) or late (more than 4 hours) after the onset of migraine; headache. Furthermore, sumatriptan effectively treated the non-headache symptoms of migraine (nausea, vomiting, photo- and phonophobia), reduced functional impairment, and the need for additional medication, and both formulations were rated highly by the patients. Oral sumatriptan was significantly more effective than two commonly-used oral acute treatments for migraine: ergotamine 2mg plus caffeine 200mg, and aspirin 900mg plus metoclopramide 10mg.
   Conclusions: Sumatriptan, given subcutaneously or orally, is an effective acute treatment for migraine and remains so with repeated intermittent long-term use.

AB OBJECTIVE Since GH substitution therapy is now available for adult GH deficient patients, information on the cardiovascular effects of GH substitution has assumed major clinical interest. We have therefore assessed cardiovascular effects of short and long-term growth hormone substitution therapy in these patients.
   PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS Doppler echocardiography was performed in 21 GH deficient patients after 4 months placebo and 4 months GH therapy, in a double blind cross-over study. In an open design study, 13 patients were reinvestigated following 16 months and 9 patients following 38 months of GH therapy. Twenty-one age and sex-matched normal control subjects were also investigated.
   RESULTS Heart rate was increased in placebo treated patients as compared to controls. After 4 months of GH treatment, heart rate showed a further increase (10%, P < 0.01) and seemed to remain elevated after 16 months of GH therapy. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly lower in placebo treated patients than in controls, and did not change significantly after GH treatment. The left ventricular diastolic diameter was reduced in patients as compared to controls, but increased after 4 months GH therapy (P > 0.05) and seemed to increase further during prolonged GH treatment. Cardiac index was at the same level in controls and in placebo-treated patients, but increased by 20% following GH therapy and remained elevated after 16 and 38 months (P < 0.05) of GH substitution.
   CONCLUSION Following GH substitution in GH deficient adult patients, left ventricular diastolic dimensions increased and seemed to normalize, while heart rate and cardiac output were found to be increased to supranormal levels.

AB Following 4 weeks on placebo, eighteen pateints with bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome (BTS) were treated with 100 mg xamoterol twice daily for 2-4 weeks. Ambulatory 24 h Holter electrocardiogram recordings showed that xamoterol decreased maximum heart rate from 140 +/- 5.1 to 107 +/- 6 beats min(-1) (P < 0.001) during exercise, increased minimum heart rate from 43 +/- 1.7 to 51 +/- 2.4 beats min(-1) (P < 0.005) at night and shortened maximum duration of sinus arrest from 3438 +/- 484 to 1767 +/- 202 ms (P < 0.005) in BTS. Symptomatically, patients reported that palpitations were improved and syncopal attacks disappeared. Although the study has the limitation of an open design, effects of treatment were objectively evaluated using Holter monitoring by investigators who reviewed the recordings in a blinded manner. The findings suggest that xamoterol may be useful in the treatment of BTS. Further studies are needed to evaluate fully its therapeutic potential in this condition.

AB The effects on weight gain and eating behavior and the acceptability of dexfenfluramine (Isomeride(R)) given for five weeks with a diet during smoking cessation were evaluated using an open design in 59 overweight patients who wanted to quit smoking but were concerned that this might further increase their weight. Patient characteristics were as follows: mean weight 80.4 +/- 1.8 kg; mean excess weight 26.8 +/- 2.2% above the theoretical ideal weight; and mean body mass index 27.9 +/- 0,5 kg/m2. This study, which was conducted in 1991, was done without nicotine replacement therapy. At each visit, body weight was measured, eating behavior was evaluated using self-administered scales, and smoking cessation was assessed. Body weight decreased (mean 4.1 +/- 2.5 kg) or remained unchanged in 72% of patients despite cessation of smoking. Only 28% of patients gained weight. Weight loss was accompanied with decreased craving for sweet and starchy foods in two-thirds of cases. Body weight changes and craving for sweet foods were correlated. The satisfactory data on the acceptability and safety of dexfenfluramine are confirmed in this study. Three-fifths of the patients reported no cigarette use after five weeks. Relapses were more common in subjects with severe nicotine dependency and less motivation to quit. Currently, nicotine replacement therapy significantly increases the quit rate and improves patient comfort during the withdrawal period. However, weight gain remains a cause of relapse and requires dietary therapy and, in some instances, short-term specific pharmacotherapy.

AB Considerable development has taken place of the CO2 sputter source at Oxford. The use of a hemispherical ioniser has increased reproducibility of beam behaviour and a more open source design has helped to improve the initial cleaning of the targets. The operation of the source with graphite has also been investigated with C-12- currents in excess of 300 muA achieved. Space charge effects in the injection system have been reduced by neutralisation which can be achieved using a ps dosing valve in the region of the first beam waist. Preliminary experiments have been done to test the feasibility of linking the source to a GC system for GC-AMS.

TI CLOZAPINE TREATMENT OF SPASMODIC TORTICOLLIS
SO NEUROLOGY

DT Note
ID BOTULINUM TOXIN
AB We report a trial of clozapine (CLO) in patients with spasmodic torticollis (ST). In an open-design trial we treated five patients with adult-onset ST with CLO (300 mg/d) over 12 weeks and one patient over 3 weeks. We videotaped the patients three times (before and at the end of CLO treatment, and 2 weeks after CLO withdrawal) according to a standardized protocol. At the end of the treatment period, CLO plasma concentrations ranged from 67 to 371 ng/ml. In all six patients, analysis of the video ratings and patients' self-assessments failed to reveal any improvement of ST. These preliminary results fail to confirm any therapeutic benefit of CLO in the treatment of ST.

TI THE INTERNATIONAL DIFFUSION OF THE CLINICAL-TRIALS CARRIED OUT IN SPAIN
   - ANALYSIS THROUGH THEIR PUBLICATION IN SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS
SO MEDICINA CLINICA
LA Spanish
DT Article
ID SPANISH
AB BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated the clinical trials carried out in Spain and published in international journals. The present study has analyzed this situation over the period from 1981 to 1990.
   METHODS: Spanish studies including <<clinical trial>> as a key word present in Excerpta Medica CD (Drugs and Pharmacology) or MEDLINE in the CD-ROM version were evaluated.
   RESULTS: TWO hundred forty-one original articles were obtained. The number of clinical trials was relatively stable from 1981 to 1986 (n = 8-15) increasing to a maximum from 1986 to 1988 (n = 64) with a posterior decrease. The languages of publication were English (51 %) and Spanish (49 %). A significant increase was observed in the number of articles published in English (p < 0.01) in the last five years. Phase III and IV clinical trials were the most frequent (89 %) followed by those of phase II (9 %) and phase I (2 %). The open design predominated in the phase Ill-IV trials (58 %) over the double blind trials (37 %) and the single blind trials (5 %). Among the former 70 % were comparative and 57 % followed randomized treatments. The clinical trials were published in 112 journals, Medicina Clinica (n = 32) and Current Therapeutic Research Clinical and Experimental(n = 6) were the most frequently used in Spanish and English, respectively. Two hundred sixty-three drugs were studied in the clinical trials, cisplatin was the most frequently studied (n = 10). The most commonly studied pharmacologic groups were antiinfectious (n = 40) and cytostatic (n = 35). The number of randomized clinical trials increased significantly after 1986 (p < 0.01)
   CONCLUSIONS: An increase in the number of clinical trials published in international journals was observed with preference for publication in English. The growing presence of randomized double blind clinical trials suggests an improvement in the quality of the clinical trials performed in Spain, particularly after 1986.

AB Examination of lung washings from primitive air-breathing fishes (ropefish, bichirs, and gar) revealed a lipid-based surfactant with an average disaturated phospholipid-to-total phospholipid ratio five times lower than in mammals. The lung lavage of fishes was exceptionally rich in cholesterol, resulting in average cholesterol-to-phospholipid ratios three times higher, and cholesterol-to-disaturated phospholipid ratios nearly 15 times higher, than those of mammals. Removal of lung surfactant doubled the pressures necessary to initially open the anterior regions of collapsed lungs in all three fish species but had little or no effect on pressures required to fill the lung (i.e., compliance) after the initial opening. The elevated cholesterol content found in pulmonary surfactant of these fishes is consistent with such findings in other ectotherms, suggesting that the proportional elevation of cholesterol may serve to stabilize the fluidity of the lung surfactant over broader temperature ranges. The influence of surfactant on lung opening pressures rather than on compliance contrasts with that seen in mammals and supports an ''antiglue'' role of pulmonary surfactant in the simpler open-design lungs of lower vertebrates.

AB Variations of serum and nasal specific IgE to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Der p) during alternate periods of antigen avoidance-exposure have been evaluated with an open design in a group of allergic children with asthma and rhinitis at the residential house Istituto Pio XII (Misurina, BL, Italy), at 1756 m, in the Italian Dolomites. A method based on direct incubation of allergen coupled substrate on the nasal mucosa has been employed to evaluate the levels of nasal IgE. Serum specific IgE decreased respectively from (median) 117-89.3 kU/1 (P < 0.001) during an initial period of 3 months of allergen avoidance and from 88.2 to 78.4 kU/1 (P < 0.0002) during a subsequent period of allergen avoidance. No significant increase in serum specific IgE was, in contrast, observed during two periods, 22 and 9 days, of antigen exposure, changing respectively from 89.3 to 88.2 and from 78.4 to 89.1 kU/1. In contrast, nasal IgE has been significantly influenced by the alternate periods of antigen exposure-avoidance, showing a decrease from 19.75 to 4.01 kU/1 (P < 0.0001) after the initial period of avoidance, followed by an increase to 9.95 kU/1 (P < 0.0001) after 22 days of exposure. A significant decrease to a value of 2.37 kU/1 (P < 0.0001) was also observed during the subsequent period of avoidance, followed again by an increase to 7.87 kU/1 (P < 0.002) after 9 days of exposure. The evaluation of the kinetics of changes in nasal specific IgE revealed a significant decrease (P < 0.01) as soon as antigen avoidance was implemented for 3 days. Nasal specific IgE, therefore, appears to be a more sensitive index of antigen exposure-avoidance than serum IgE levels.

AB The effect of the selective serotonin-2 antagonist ritanserin was investigated in an open study of patients with schizophrenia. The patients were in an acute psychotic state considered to require neuroleptic medication. No neuroleptic drug was allowed during the study or during the last month preceeding the study. Oxazepam or nitrazepam were allowed for sedation or sleep inducement. Safety, tolerability, potential antipsychotic effect, and drug effects on monoamine metabolites in serum and CSF and prolactin in serum were evaluated. Central D-2-dopamine receptor occupancy was determined by positron emission tomography. Ten male patients (mean age 32.4) fulfilling DSM-III-R criteria for schizophrenia were included in the study. Nine of these patients completed 4 weeks' treatment with ritanserin 10 mg b.i.d. The clinical effect was evaluated by means of CPRS and SANS and significant improvement was seen after 4 weeks' treatment both in positive and negative symptoms. Ritanserin was well tolerated and no extrapyramidal symptoms or akathisia were seen. Concentrations of monoamine metabolites and prolactin did not change during treatment. Ritanserin did not occupy D-2-dopamine receptors. Thus, no indications of any D-2-dopamine-antagonistic activity were obtained. All patients had expected ritanserin levels in plasma during the whole study. This first study of a selective serotonin-2 antagonist in the treatment of acute schizophrenic patients demonstrated significant clinical effects. However, the open design of the study does not allow us to conclude with any certainty that the patients' improvement was due to a specific blockade of serotonin-a receptors or unspecific factors, although a direct D-2-dopamine blockade could be ruled out.

AB 239 patients with streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis completed treatment with phenoxymethyl penicillin 12.5 mg per kg body weight b.i.d. for 10 days. At examination after completing therapy, throat specimens from 53 patients (22%) yielded growth of group A streptococci of the same T-type as the initial culture (bacterial treatment failure). 20 of these 53 (38%) had symptoms and signs of tonsillitis (clinical and bacterial treatment failure). 48 of the patients with bacterial failure were randomly allocated to phenoxymethyl penicillin or clindamycin in an open design; 22 of them received a second course of phenoxymethyl penicillin for 10 days and 26 were given clindamycin, 6.5 mg per kg body weight b.i.d. (children) or 300 mg t.i.d. (adults) for 10 days. After completing their treatment, 14 of 22 patients (64%) given phenoxymethyl penicillin harboured the same T-type as in the previous two cultures, while group A streptococci were not recovered from any of the 26 patients receiving clindamycin. In patients with clinical failure after phenoxymethyl penicillin treatment, a new course with this drug is not motivated. In that situation clindamycin seems to be an efficient choice.

AB Lithium (Li) reduces brain inositol levels by inhibiting the enzyme inositol monophosphatase. The enzyme inositol-1-phosphatase was measured in human red blood cells of controls, Li-free bipolar patients, and Li-treated bipolar patients and was found to be reduced by 80% in Li-treated bipolars, thus supporting the concept that chronic Li at therapeutic concentrations inhibits this enzyme. Two behaviors in rats caused by Li, reduction of rearing, and Li-pilocarpine seizures, are reversed by intracerebroventricular replenishment of inositol. The reversal is stereospecific to the naturally occurring myo-inositol; whereas the stereoisomer L-chiro-inositol is ineffective. The reversal is dose-dependent, requiring a dose consistent with known quantities of brain inositol depletion; and is time-dependent, as inositol must be given 1-8 h before stimulation. High-dose peripheral inositol also reverses the limbic seizures induced by Li-pilocarpine, and using gas chromatography was shown to increase brain inositol levels that had been reduced by Li treatment. Low-dose inositol could be shown to reverse a peripheral Li-induced side effect, polyurialpolydipsia, in rats and in patients treated with Li. A higher dose of inositol markedly reduced Hamilton Depression Ratings in 9 of 11 unipolar major depressive disorder patients previously unresponsive to tricyclics, in an open design, but had no effect on chronic schizophrenics in a controlled double-blind randomized crossover trial. A new inositol monophosphatase inhibitor, a fungal product originally discovered as a complement inhibitor, was found to act like Li and lower the seizure threshold for subconvulsant doses of pilocarpine. These data suggest that inositol monophosphatase inhibition is a key mechanism of Li's therapeutic action and that design of new inositol monophosphatase inhibitors may be a practical strategy to create new compounds with Li-like therapeutic effects.

Salbutamol aerosol was delivered by the dosimeter in successive cumulative doses of 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 mug, and by the IPPB device in doses of 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 mg. There were 30-minute intervals between each dose of salbutamol, and pulmonary function was measured both before the drug's administration and 15 minutes after each dose. No dose increments were given once the dose response curve had reached a plateau. The treatments were given on 2 successive days, at the same time each morning. The mean doses required to achieve the highest forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) were very small for both techniques-0.41 mg for the IPPB device and 0.17 mg for the dosimeter, the latter being significantly smaller (P = 0.04). The highest FEV1 was significantly better with the IPPB device than with the dosimeter (P = 0.006); however, the highest forced vital capacity was similar with both techniques. We conclude that the dosimeter nebulizer is a drug-sparing, convenient, and efficient technique in aerosol drug therapy.

TI EFFECT OF AGE AND RENAL-FUNCTION ON THE PHARMACOKINETICS OF
   COADMINISTERED CEFOPERAZONE AND SULBACTAM
SO DRUG INVESTIGATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The single dose pharmacokinetics of cefoperazone lg and sulbactam 0.5g, coadministered intravenously, were evaluated in 3 different age groups. Eight healthy young, 8 healthy middle-aged, and 8 healthy elderly adults were studied in an open design. The terminal half-life of cefoperazone (3.0 vs 2.3 hours) was 1.3 times greater in the elderly than in the young subjects and 2.5 times greater for sulbactam (1.8 vs 0.7 hours). Total sulbactam clearance was found to correlate better with age (r = 0.59) than was total cefoperazone clearance (r = 0.40). Volume of distribution, adjusted for bodyweight, remained constant with age. The relationship between creatinine clearance (CL(CR)) and age in this study is described as (CL(CR) = -1.37 age + 158.28; r = 0.72, p = 0.0001). Multivariate regression analysis of total body clearance versus age and creatinine clearance did not significantly improve the correlation for sulbactam (r = 0.62, p = 0.95) or cefoperazone (r = 0.44, p = 0.87). Sulbactam remained at or above the serum concentrations (8 mg/L) considered to provide optimal synergy with cefoperazone for 1.8, 2.2 and 3.3 hours postinfusion in the young, middle-aged and elderly subjects, respectively.

ID CLINICAL USE; BENZODIAZEPINE
AB In an open design, randomised, two-way cross-over study, a single 2 mg i. v. dose and, a single 30 mg oral dose of flumazenil were each administered to a group of healthy young (n = 6) and elderly (n = 12) volunteers (male: female 2/1). Plasma samples were collected at intervals and intact drug was assayed.
   Both the IV and oral doses of flumazenil were very well tolerated by both age groups and no severe or unexpected adverse effects were observed. The main complaints were dizziness and headache, mainly after oral dosing, probably due to the higher C(max) and AUC following this route of administration. After 2 mg i. v. the disposition parameters in the two age groups (elderly/young) were very similar: volume of distribution (V(ss)): 0.88/0.90 l.kg-1; total body clearance (Cl(PL)): 0.86/0.99 l.min-1, terminal elimination half-life (t1/2beta): 1.02/0.91 h. After the 30 mg oral dose the mean C(max) of 87.6 ng.ml-1 (elderly) and 78.4 ng.ml-1 (young) were generally reached within 0.5 to 1 h. In 26% (elderly) and 23% (young), the absolute bioavailability of flumazenil was very similar.
   It is concluded that the absorption and disposition paramters of flumazenil were not significantly affected by aging.

AB The action of simvastatin on serum lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins (apo) was investigated in 12 patients with primary moderate hypercholesterolemia in a double-blind, placebo-controlled protocol. After a 2-week placebo baseline and dietary stabilization period, 8 patients received simvastatin 10 mg/day and 4 patients received placebo under a double-blind design for 8 weeks; then all 12 were treated with simvastatin 10 mg/day in an open design for 8 weeks. In the group treated with simvastatin initially, at the end of the 16th week of therapy, simvastatin significantly reduced total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apo B, and apo E by 25%, 30%, 25%, and 18%, respectively. The results obtained confirm previous research by other authors and may suggest, furthermore, a mechanism of accelerated clearance of very-low-density lipoprotein remnants.

AB The Regional Migraine Field Trial assessed the efficacy and safety of dihydroergotamine mesylate (D.H.E. 45(R)) for migraine in the office setting. Patients were admitted to the study provided they met the International Headache Society definition of migraine with or without aura. Thirty-eight neurologists enrolled 311 patients (274 women and 37 men) between the ages of 13 and 70 years in this open-design study. Ninety-five percent of the patients had moderate or severe headache pain at entry, and 62% had nausea. All patients received a single intramuscular injection of D.H.E. 45(R) 1 mg. A second intramuscular injection of 1 mg was given 60 minutes after the first injection, if needed. An antiemetic was administered concomitantly with D.H.E. 45(R), if needed. Rescue therapy was given at the investigators' discretion. Efficacy was judged by the relief of pain, patients' ability to function, need for a second injection, need for rescue medication, and need for an antiemetic. At 30 and 60 minutes, 46% and 72% of patients had only mild or no head pain, respectively. At 24 hours, 77% of all patients had mild or no head pain. D.H.E. 45(R) also improved functional ability. At 30 and 60 minutes, 58% and 75% of patients had only mild or no disability, respectively. At 24 hours, 81% had mild or no impairment. Nausea was present in 62% of patients at the outset, 40% of patients at 30 minutes, and 30% at 60 minutes. An antiemetic was given to 43% of patients at the outset. The presence of nausea was similar whether or not patients received an antiemetic. Rescue medication was needed for 11% of patients, and adverse events were reported by 9%. In conclusion, D.H.E. 45(R) is effective therapy for acute migraine. A second dose provides additional relief, if needed.

AB EMS design has traditionally been a top-down process, in which a single vendor provides the algorithms, software and hardware to meet the utility's functional specifications. Recent trends in power systems, such as the move by utilities to Open Systems architectures, and the development of distributed computing systems indicate that this process must be changed to incorporate the new expertise required in EMS design. We propose an Open Design Approach to accomplish this. Our design approach is based on decomposing the EMS design problem according to different levels of abstraction. We define the components of this decomposition and discuss their relationships. These components form the conceptual design for a CAD simulation package which is being developed at UC Berkeley to evaluate and compare the performance of alternative designs.

TI ARIADNE - A CONSTRAINT-BASED APPROACH TO COMPUTER-AIDED SYNTHESIS AND
   MODELING OF ANALOG INTEGRATED-CIRCUITS
SO ANALOG INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING
LA English
DT Article
ID DESIGN
AB The ARIADNE approach to computer-aided synthesis and modeling of analog circuits is presented. It is a mathematical approach based on the use of equations. Equations are regarded as constraints on a circuit's design space and analog circuit design is modeled as a constraint satisfaction problem. To generate and efficiently satisfy constraints, advanced computational techniques such as constraint propagation, interval propagation, symbolic simulation, and qualitative simulation are applied. These techniques cover design problems such as topology construction, modeling, nominal analysis, tolerance analysis, sizing and optimization of analog circuits. The advantage of this approach is the clear separation of design knowledge from design procedures. Design knowledge is modeled in declarative equation-based models (DEBMs). Design procedures are implemented into general applicable CAD tools. The ARIADNE approach closely matches the reasoning style applied by experienced designers. The integration of synthesis and modeling into one frame and the clear separation of design knowledge from design procedures eases the process of extending the synthesis system with new circuit topologies, turning it into an open design system. This system can be used by both inexperienced and experienced designers in either interactive or automated mode.

AB A double-blind, placebo-controlled study with syntocinon (oxytocin) was carried out in 12 patients, nine females and three males with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Patients were treated by intranasal administration of oxytocin spray (18 IU per day) or placebo. No reductions in the number of obsessions or compulsive behaviors were observed in either treatment group. To evaluate whether a higher dosage would exert more beneficial effects, two additional patients were treated with a threefold higher dosage of oxytocin using an open design. In one patient a slight reduction in the number of checking rituals was observed, whereas in the other patient virtually no effect was observed.  The results of this study do not support the hypothesis that oxytocin might be a potential anticompulsive agent.

AB STUDY OBJECTIVE:  To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and hypocholesterolemic effect of an aluminum hydroxide-containing antacid in hyper-cholesterolemic individuals.
   DESIGN:  A prospective, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled phase of 2 months' duration, followed by an open-design treatment phase of 2 months' duration and a washout phase of 2 months' duration.
   SETTING:  Family practice clinics of two rural communities (kibbutzim) in Israel.
   PATIENTS:  Fifty-six men and women with hypercholesterolemia (type IIa or IIb).  Fifty individuals completed the study.
   INTERVENTION:  After 2 months of dietary modification (low-fat, low-cholesterol diet), the participants were randomized into two matched groups.  Group 1 (28 participants) was treated for 2 months with a chewable antacid tablet containing simethicone, magnesium hydroxide, and 113 mg of aluminum hydroxide per tablet, at a dose of two tablets four times daily.  Group 2 (22 participants) was given a similar number of placebo tablets for 2 months.  During the following 2 months, both groups received the antacid at the above dose.
   MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:  Lipoprotein levels were evaluated at baseline and every 2 months thereafter for 6 months.  Compared with pretreatment levels, Group 1 experienced a decrease in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) of 9.8% after 2 months (p < 0.001) and 18.5% after 4 months (p < 0.001).  Compared with Group 2, the decrease in LDL-C in Group 1 was 6.2% at the end of the 2-month double-masked, placebo phase.  Although the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was also reduced in Group 1 at the end of 4 months of therapy (10.2%), the HDL-C/LDL-C ratio increased by 13% during the same interval (p < 0.05).  The treatment was well tolerated, with minimal side effects.
   CONCLUSIONS:  An aluminum hydroxide-containing antacid reduces LDL-C in hypercholesterolemic individuals.  Although HDL-C was also reduced to a lesser extent, the overall atherogenic index was improved.  Further studies should be conducted to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of antacids containing aluminum hydroxide in hypercholesterolemic patients.

AB Growth hormone treatment in GH-deficient adults has proved beneficial in recent short-term trials, but long-term results have not yet been reported. Thirteen GH-deficient adults (4 females, 9 males; mean (SEM) age 26.4 (1.7) years), who had completed 4 months of GH therapy in a double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over study were followed, for further 16.1 (0.8) months of uninterrupted GH therapy in an open design. A significant mean increase of 1.3 cm in linear height was recorded, whereas body mass index remained unchanged. Mean muscle volume of the thigh, estimated by computerised tomography, increased significantly compared with that of the initial placebo period (p = 0.01), and a slight decrease was recorded in adipose tissue volume of the thigh (p = 0.10) and subscapular skinfold thickness (p = 0.10). Still, the muscle to fat ratio of the thigh was significantly lower compared with that of normal subjects (72.6/27.4 vs 77.9/22.1) (p < 0.01). The mean isometric strength of the quadriceps muscles increased significantly during long-term GH therapy (p < 0.01), but remained lower compared with that of normal subjects (1.66 (0.10) vs 2.13 (0.11) Nm/kg body weight). Exercise capacity performed on a bicycle ergometer increased significantly after long-term therapy (p < 0.05), but still did not reach the values seen in normal subjects (22.5 (3.4) vs 37.4 (4.2) watt . min . kg-1. No adverse reactions were recorded during long-term therapy and hemoglobin A1c remained unchanged. These data suggest that long-term GH replacement therapy in GH-deficient adults has beneficial effects on several physiological features which are subnormal in these patients.

AB In this multicenter study we compared the activity and tolerability of sodium hyaluronate (HA) and 6-methylprednisolone acetate (6-MPA) administered by intra-articular route to patients suffering from osteoarthritis of the knee. The study was conducted with an open design since different regimens were used for the two treatments. HA was administered once a week for five weeks, and 6-MPA once a week for three weeks. During the two months of follow-up the following parameters were assessed: spontaneous pain, rest pain, load pain, touch pain, joint motion, morning stiffness, and volume of effusion. Ninety patients were treated in all, each randomly allocated to one of the treatment groups. The results of our study show that both treatments were efficacious in reducing the symptoms linked with osteoarthritis of the knee. The steroid had a more rapid action, which did not, however, last as long as that of HA. Indeed, at the final examination most parameters showed significant differences between the treatments.

AB Enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) are established single agent treatments for mild hypertension and cardiac failure and are a potent combination in more severe or resistant cases.  We have compared the pharmacokinetics of enalaprilat (the active metabolite of enalapril) and HCT in a four-way comparison of a combination tablet of enalapril (10 mg)/HCT (25 mg) with a single dose of an enalapril tablet (10 mg), a single dose of a HCT tablet (25 mg) and simultaneous administration of separate tablets of enalapril (10 mg) and HCT (25 mg) in normotensive volunteers (n = 12, 21-26 years).  Each subject received all four treatments and the study was conducted as a randomized, latin square, open design with at least 1 week washout between studies.  Overall, HCT was bioequivalent under all conditions and enalaprilat was bioequivalent when given in combination with HCT either as one tablet or as two separate tablets.  However, when given with HCT, the mean AUC and C(max) of enalaprilat were reduced up to 20 per cent compared with enalapril administered alone.  This is unlikely to be of clinical significance as the differences did not reach statistical significance and the total enalaprilat excreted in the urine over 96 h was similar after all treatments.

DE MAGNESIUM; MENSTRUAL MIGRAINE
ID PREMENSTRUAL-SYNDROME; SYMPTOMS; FAILURE
AB The effects of oral Magnesium (Mg) pyrrolidone carboxylic acid were evaluated in 20 patients affected by menstrual migraine, in a double-blind, placebo controlled study.  After a two cycles run-in period, the treatment (360 mg/day of Mg or placebo) started on the 15th day of the cycle and continued till the next menses, for two months.  Oral Mg was then supplemented in an open design for the next two months.
   At the 2nd month, the Pain Total Index was decreased by both Placebo and Mg, with patients receiving active drug showing the lowest values (P < 0.03).  The number of days with headache was reduced only in the patients on active drug.  Mg treatment also improved premenstrual complaints, as demonstrated by the significant reduction of Menstrual Distress Questionnaire (MDQ) scores.  The reduction of PTI and MDQ scores was observed also at the 4th month of treatment, when Mg was supplemented in all the patients.
   Intracellular Mg++ levels in patients with menstrual migraine were reduced compared to controls.  During oral Mg treatment, the Mg++ content of Lymphocytes (LC) and Polymorphonucleated cells (PMN) significantly increased, while no changes in plasma or Red Blood Cells were found.  An inverse correlation between PTI and Mg++ content in PMN was demonstrated.
   These data point to magnesium supplementation as a further means for menstrual migraine prophylaxis, and support the possibility that a lower migraine threshold could be related to magnesium deficiency.

ID ARTICULAR-CARTILAGE; PROTEOGLYCAN
AB An open design has been carried out by the authors comparing the efficacy and the tolerance of galactosoaminoglucuronoglycan sulfates (GAGs) with those of ibuprofen lysine in patients affected by osteoarthritis (OA).  The experimental group included forty patients of both sexes, aged from 35 to 67 years, with diffuse OA.  Ten patients were treated with GAGs administered orally (600-1200 mg/die) and ten patients with GAGs administered intramuscularly (50-100 mg/die); likewise for the ibuprofen therapy two subgroups were formed, such that ten patients were given the drug orally (1500-2500 mg/die) and ten patients had intramuscular therapy (400-800 mg/die).  The treatment lasted 40 days.  The parameters considered were:  pain at rest, pain on pressure, pain on active movement and pain on passive movement.  Tolerance was considered by carrying out some routinary laboratory tests and a careful clinical and anamnestic examination.  At the end of the study, an improvement in all the clinical variables considered was found in both groups of patients, with no significant differences between the oral and the intramuscular administrations.   With regard to tolerance, it must be noted that 10% of the patients in each of the two considered groups patients suffered from gastro-intestinal diseases (pain, nausea, pyrosis).  The results achieved, therefore, confirm the efficacy and above all the good tolerance of GAGs in the treatment of OA, characteristics of particular importance for a drug designed for the therapy of a chronic pathology such as OA.
