AB Non-uniformities at the engine inlet call for novel design techniques to cater to the performance and aeromechanical challenges. The purpose of the fan system is to mitigate the effects of distortion in the flow and to provide thrust to the vehicle. This paper discusses a harmonic based open source design system (NAX) and demonstrates its capabilities for applications in a boundary layer ingesting fan system. First, a primary baseline design was obtained using a typical axisymmetric design approach for the rotor and OGV (Outlet Guide Vanes). This baseline design now serves as the basis for further development, based on user-defined design features. Subsequently, using this baseline design, a circumferentially non-axisymmetric design of the OGV is obtained by means of inducing perturbations in blade leading edge metal angles using Fourier coefficients and phase values. The other parameters that can be varied radially as Bezier curves and tangentially as Fourier modes are: trailing edge metal angle, chord, lean, sweep, curvature and thickness. A smooth spanwise curvature controlled 3D design of OGV is discussed using the open source geometry generator, T-Blade3. The OGV geometry files along with the detailed documentation are also available for download on the T-Blade3 website and NAX source code on Github website. This design is further optimized to improve the non-axisymmetric geometric distribution against the distorted flow conditions. The design system proposed here helps in exploration of user-specified parametric design space for development of a non-axisymmetric fan stage. Further, since the design system is modular in nature, it can easily be integrated at multiple process levels for other types of turbomachinery design applications.

AB This article illustrates how to evaluate platform design for an open source hardware development project. First, we will look at the open source hardware development as a methodology that fulfills demands for mass customization. In the open source hardware development, project owner offers platform sources and individual developers separately develop various functional modules based on the given platform sources. Then customers will choose each module which best meets their needs. Second, the evaluation model for the open source hardware platform will be suggested. For open source hardware development, developers' participation is one of the key factors in successful project management. Developers will consider both estimated development costs and market size to make a decision on participation. With all these concerns, we built a platform evaluation model for open source hardware projects in terms of how much it boosts the developers' participation.

AB Physiological (or biosignal) data acquisition and analysis has evolved from being intrinsically bound to medical practice or lab settings, to become a pervasive data source with numerous applications. This has been mostly leveraged by the proliferation of wearables and open hardware platforms. While the first devices offer good cloud connectivity (albeit to proprietary servers) but only provide high-level features, the latter have opposite characteristics, creating a gap in what concerns collaborative access to datasets for reuse in academic research. In this paper we describe a module devised to help bridge this gap, by enabling real-time biosignal streaming directly from an open hardware physiological data acquisition platform to a cloud-based repository over Wi-Fi. Performance tests have been made to assess the data transmission reliability, and the adopted approach to the repository enables user-friendly collaborative access, visualisation and sharing of the recorded data.

AB An experimental setup capable of stimulating, inhibiting, sensing, processing and analyzing a biological system is presented. The experimental setup is based on open-source, open hardware commercial devices. It can be applied to record and control neuronal activity, for example to establish causal links between neurons and behaviorin a closed-loop fashion. Cells or group of cells can be triggered by acoustical, electrical or light impulses. This last case is based on a technique defined as optogenetics. The latter is used in an example that reads and controls neuronal activity of a population of neurons in laboratory rats forcing them to transition between neuronal states, illustrates the system developed in this work.

AB Several technological solutions are being researched to establish efficient, reliable, and robust wireless vehicular electric charging on a wide scale. We propose an artificial vision system - the Grid Alignment Assistant System (GAAS) - aimed at maximizing the energy flow between the transmitting and receiving goals, by supporting the driver in the task of keeping an alignment between the vehicle and the charging grids in the road. GAAS exploits low cost and open hardware and software components. GAAS supports IoT capabilities as an API cloud service is developed for real-time measurements storage. This paper presents road test results showing that high precision misalignment estimations can be achieved, and presents some challenges imposed by the actual deployment environment.

AB We demonstrate the Scamp5d integrated vision system and its development framework. The sensor of the camera is the SCAMP-5 vision chip, which provides sensor-level SIMD parallel processing capability, embedding a processor in each of its 256 x 256 pixels. A dual-core ARM micro-controller is used to operate the vision chip and provide additional computation capability and IO interfaces. The vision system is programmed using the C++ language. Common IO buses, as well as a USB2.0 port, allow the Scamp5d to be connected to micro-controllers, single board computers, or other hardware. The vision system can be remotely debugged, configured and re-programmed over the network. The open design of Scamp5d's software interface allows for easy integration with other software systems, such as ROS. As a self-contained vision system, Scamp5d can output highly processed data instead of video streams, which is suitable for applications such as miniature robots and distributed sensor networks. Simulation of the vision chip is provided through cross-compiling. Documentation, tutorials, and the simulation software are available for download.

AB The open-source hardware movement is becoming increasingly popular due to the emergence of successful low-cost technologies, such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi, and thanks to the community of makers that actively share their creations to be freely studied, modified, and re-distributed. Numerous authors have proposed distinct ways to seize this approach for accomplishing a variety of learning goals: enabling scholars to explore scientific concepts, promoting students' creativity, helping them to be more fluent and expressive with new technologies, and so on. This paper reports a systematic mapping study that overviews the literature on open-source hardware in education by analyzing and classifying 676 publications. The results of our work provide: 1) guidance on the published material (identifying the most relevant papers, publication sources, institutions, and countries); 2) information about the pedagogical uses of open-source hardware (showing its main educational goals, stages, and topics where it is principally applied); and 3) directions for future research.

AB The use of Robotics as a teaching tool to foster knowledge in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics - STEM for high school students is growing. Within this context, the need for solutions that decreases the overall cost of hardware is mandatory. In this work, a 25 euros Android-based mobile robot that allows connecting a smartphone to different robot "bodies" (each composed by different hardware: Arduino, LEGO, etc.) is proposed, targeting mainly high school students. The mobile platform was built using 3D printed parts and uses an Arduino board to control the servos used for the locomotion. To communicate with the Android application, a Bluetooth module is also used. The Android application takes advantage of the smartphone camera and has some pre-implemented image processing modules, allowing actions such as coloured line following, colour proximity detection and coloured object tracking. Another import feature present in the Android application is its coding capability, thanks to an embedded code interpreter. This feature was implemented using BeanShell, a lightweight script interpreter for Java. It allows writing scripts in Java programming language, which are then executed by the robot. This interpreter also provides a way for the user to write a set of instructions that defines the behaviour of the robot, primarily by checking the current status of the sensors and the smartphone camera, and manipulating the velocity of the motors.
   All of the necessary components (3D source CAD + STLs) of the mobile platform presented here are available online, enabling the recreation of a replica of the robot body. A detailed list of electronic components and its connections are also provided, as well as the Arduino source code along with the installation file needed for the Android application. All the necessary information can be accessed at: https://github.com/ee09115/squirlrob.
   The high school students are then challenged to solve classical robotics tasks like line following, obstacle avoidance, and using the virtual sensors to create new challenges.
   By providing this set of tools (Android app, source code, 3D CAD models, documentation), a promotion of knowledge is expected, thus developing enthusiast students in robotics multidisciplinary fields, such as mechanical designing, electronics designing, mathematics, coding, etc. (in short, all the relevant STEM areas).
   Finally, a general analysis of the usability, interoperability and feature extension capacity is made, always taking into consideration the educational purposes of this work.

DE curation; application-linked repository; OER; open educational
   resources; open access
AB Open educational resources (OER) refer to any kind of learning and research materials that reside in the public domain or have been released under a broad open license. The Paris OER Declaration of 2012 provided a set of recommendations to foster the sustainable development of quality learning resources through the adoption of appropriate standards to encourage open licensing of educational materials produced with public funds. Since January 2017 the authors are involved in a Horizon 2020 project, Up to University (Up2U), aimed at developing an innovative ecosystem to facilitate open design and use of digital content adapted for high school students preparing for University. Following the guidelines and recommendations from various organizations (UNESCO and the EU among others), we need to adopt clear licensing as well as sound copyright policies. Furthermore, rights including permissions, access control and (when needed) anonymity must be carefully designed and thoroughly upheld. Besides meeting compliance with guidelines, resolutions, and recommendations from international agencies, adopting effective curation policies becomes paramount to ensuring the sustainability of the project. In this paper, we present a novel approach to curation of open educational resources, in which an application-linked repository plays a key role as the integrator of the other components of an OER based e-learning service: Open Content Creation, Learning Management System (LMS), and Data Analytics. Once this application-linked repository takes its place as the central unit of the learning resources management, curation policies and procedures become embedded in the operational workflow of the OER based e-learning service in a seamless way. We believe that our approach will not only be useful for our project but also for any other OER initiative.

AB Robotics and computational thinking are ideal tools for developing science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) pedagogy. Today, educational robotics tools emerge with the aim of promoting innovation and motivation of students during the learning process. Robots are becoming more common in our daily lives; therefore, it is important to integrate robots into all levels of our society. This demonstrator focuses on driving the same content through three low-cost robotic educational tools. The first is Scratch, where you can schedule interactive stories, games and animations. The second tool is Crumble, an easy-to-use programmable controller. Its programming interface uses a block programming language that facilitates its use. Finally, Arduino is an open source, hardware- and software-based platform that is easy to use and has great potential for developing robotic applications. This demonstrator aims to present the above platforms as educational robotics tools as the first step into the world of robotics. Throughout this demonstrator an introduction to educational robotics is developed.

AB Children with a variety of diagnoses have impairments that limit their arm function. Despite the fact that arm function is important for early learning and activities of daily living, there are few tools to assist movement for these children, and existing devices have challenges related to cost, accessibility, comfort, and aesthetics. In this article, we describe the design process and development of the first garment-based exoskeleton to assist arm movement in young children with movement impairments: the Playskin Lift (TM). We outline our design process, which contrasts with the traditional medical model in that it is interdisciplinary, user-centered, and addresses the broad needs of users, rather than device function alone. Then we report the results of field-testing with the initial prototype with respect to our design metrics on a toddler with significant bilateral arm movement impairments. Finally, we summarize our ongoing development aimed at increasing comfort, aesthetics, and accessibility of the garment. The interdisciplinary, user-centered approach to assistive technology design presented here can result in innovative and impactful design solutions that translate to the real world.

AB Many initiatives exist to increase the adoption of open educational practices (OEP) within universities, but few initiatives start by exploring the capacity of educators to adopt open approaches. This paper addresses this challenge, suggesting that in order to build OEP capacity, universities should build on the existing skills of local champions who are familiar with open approaches. The paper builds on the Open Educators' Factory methodology to map the capacities of university teachers across four areas: open design, open content, open teaching and open assessment and presents the results of its application to a case study within an Italian university. The pilot demonstrates that by using this approach, it is possible to map universities' existing OEP and connect them with the capability of local educators. This enables university managers to build on the expertise of open education practitioners to raise the overall capacity of their staff to adopt open approaches.

AB This work presents the design, modeling, and implementation of a neural network inverse model controller for tracking the maximum power point of a photovoltaic (PV) module. A nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX) was implemented in a serial-parallel architecture. The PV module mathematical modeling was developed, a buck converter was designed to operate in the continuous conduction mode with a switching frequency of 20 KHz, and the dynamic neural controller was designed using the Neural Network Toolbox from Matlab/Simulink (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA), and it was implemented on an open-hardware Arduino Mega board. To obtain the reference signals for the NARX and determine the 65 W PV module behavior, a system made of a 0.8 W PV cell, a temperature sensor, a voltage sensor and a static neural network, was used. To evaluate performance a comparison with the P&O traditional algorithm was done in terms of response time and oscillations around the operating point. Simulation results demonstrated the superiority of neural controller over the P&O. Implementation results showed that approximately the same power is obtained with both controllers, but the P&O controller presents oscillations between 7 W and 10 W, in contrast to the inverse controller, which had oscillations between 1 W and 2 W.

AB The COPD Patient Management European Trial (COMET) investigated the efficacy and safety of a home-based COPD disease management intervention for severe COPD patients.
   The study was an international open-design clinical trial in COPD patients (forced expiratory volume in 1 s <50% of predicted value) randomised 1:1 to the disease management intervention or to the usual management practices at the study centre. The disease management intervention included a self-management programme, home telemonitoring, care coordination and medical management. The primary end-point was the number of unplanned all-cause hospitalisation days in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Secondary end-points included acute care hospitalisation days, BODE (body mass index, airflow obstruction, dyspnoea and exercise) index and exacerbations. Safety end-points included adverse events and deaths.
   For the 157 (disease management) and 162 (usual management) patients eligible for ITT analyses, all-cause hospitalisation days per year (mean +/- SD) were 17.4 +/- 35.4 and 22.6 +/- 41.8, respectively (mean difference -5.3, 95% CI -13.7 to -3.1; p=0.16). The disease management group had fewer per-protocol acute care hospitalisation days per year (p=0.047), a lower BODE index (p=0.01) and a lower mortality rate (1.9% versus 14.2%; p<0.001), with no difference in exacerbation frequency. Patient profiles and hospitalisation practices varied substantially across countries.
   The COMET disease management intervention did not significantly reduce unplanned all-cause hospitalisation days, but reduced acute care hospitalisation days and mortality in severe COPD patients.

AB Modern ultrasonic phased-array controllers are electronic systems capable of delaying the transmitted or received signals of multiple transducers. Configurable transmit-receive array systems, capable of electronic steering and shaping of the beam in near real-time, are available commercially, for example, for medical imaging. However, emerging applications, such as ultrasonic haptics, parametric audio, or ultrasonic levitation, require only a small subset of the capabilities provided by the existing controllers. To meet this need, we present Ultraino, a modular, inexpensive, and open platform that provides hardware, software, and example applications specifically aimed at controlling the transmission of narrowband airborne ultrasound. Our system is composed of software, driver boards, and arrays that enable users to quickly and efficiently perform research in various emerging applications. The software can be used to define array geometries, simulate the acoustic field in real time, and control the connected driver boards. The driver board design is based on an Arduino Mega and can control 64 channels with a square wave of up to 17 Vpp and pi/5 phase resolution. Multiple boards can be chained together to increase the number of channels. The 40-kHz arrays with flat and spherical geometries are demonstrated for parametric audio generation, acoustic levitation, and haptic feedback.

AB One of the most critical parameters in agricultural production is environmental conditions. It is of vital importance to ensure and monitor suitable climatic conditions for various controlled agricultural structures and production systems such as greenhouses. To this aim, most data monitoring systems cannot be efficiently used due to high cost and insufficient technical knowledge. It is possible to design low-cost and scalable monitoring, control and data acquisition systems via open source hardware in order to monitor climatic data for agricultural practices in small enterprises and rural areas. In this study, a low cost system designed via open source hardware was tested under real conditions. Temperature and relative humidity were measured via the sensors in the system and sent to a data server through a wireless network. In addition, collected data was compared to reference devices for statistical analysis. The results suggest that these low-cost systems, which are designed via open source hardware, can be used as a data collection and decision support, system by agricultural enterprises.

AB The need for fabricating a prototype circuit arises frequently in electronics, including education and research laboratories. In resource-poor countries in the developing world, this is hindered by the high cost of commercial Printed Circuit Board (PCB) prototyping machines and long turn-around commercial fabrication process. Practical, hands-on laboratory teaching and experimentation is necessary to improve learning in electronics. In this paper, a low-cost build-your-own (BYO) semi-automated three-axis PCB milling machine for double-sided PCB prototyping is developed using commercial components and open source hardware and free open source software, to provide students, teachers, and engineers an accessible and affordable resource for PCB prototyping. Also, the main problems encountered during fabrication of PCB have been mentioned and the techniques used to solve them are discussed in detail. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Water removal is an essential step during crude oil production due to several problems such as increased transportation costs and high corrosion rate due to dissolved salts. Indirect low frequency ultrasonic energy (US), using baths, has been recently proposed as an effective alternative for crude oil demulsification. However, the reactor position during sonication and its influence on the demulsification efficiency for crude oil has not been evaluated. In this sense, the aim of this study was to develop an automated system based on an open source hardware for mapping the acoustic field distribution in an US bath operating at 35 kHz using a hydrophone. Data acquired with this system provided information to evaluate the demulsification efficiency in the different positions of the US bath and correlate it with the acoustic intensity distribution. The automated 3D-mapping system revealed a higher acoustic intensity in the regions immediately above the transducers (ca. 0.6 W cm(-2)), while the other regions presented a relatively lower intensity (ca. 0.1 W cm(-2)). Experimental data demonstrated that reactors positioned in the most intense acoustic regions provided a much higher efficiency of demulsificadon in comparison with the ones positioned in the less intense acoustic field regions. Demulsification efficiency up to 93% was obtained with 15 min of sonication (100% amplitude) using few amount of chemical demulsifier. Hence, this work demonstrated that the information acquired with the developed mapping system could be used for inducing a higher efficiency of demulsification only by finding the more suitable position of reactor in the US bath, which certainly will help development of appropriate reactors design when looking for such approach.

AB Purpose: Vertical jump tests are used to assess lower-limb power of athletes in sport sciences. Flight time measurement with jump-mat systems is the most common procedure for this purpose. The aim of this study was to analyze the concurrent validity and reliability of two proprietary systems (Globus and Axon) and an open-source system (Chronojump). Methods: A conditioning electric circuit governed by a controlled wave generator is designed to substitute athletes jumping on a physical mat. In order to look for possible differences associated to timekeeping by each microcontroller device, all three systems are fed by the circuit simultaneously. Results: Concurrent validity was high for the three systems. Standarized typical error of estimate (TEE) was trivial, according to MBI interpretation as well as perfect Pearson correlation coefficient. Reliability was assessed based on the coefficient of variation of flight time measure, resulting in 0.17-0.63% (0.05-0.12 cm) for Globus, 0.01% (0.09 cm) for Chronojump and 5.65-9.38% (2.15-3.53 cm) for Axon. These results show that all jump-mat system produced nearly identical measures of flight time so they can be considered valid and reliable for practical purposes. In comparison, Chronojump showed the best performance whereas Axon showed enough variability and disagreement to pose a problem in testing elite athletes. Conclusions: These experiments show that open-source jump mats are as valid and reliable as their proprietary counterparts at a lower cost. Therefore, practitioners can be confident in using Globus or Chronojump systems to test athletes' jump height because of their negligible errors and Axon system to monitor general population.

AB Some countries in South America such as Ecuador, Colombia and Peru have increased their presence in the production and export of orchids. Ecuador has 14% of the world's species and in 2014 its orchid exports increased 8%, this shows the importance of this product for the country. An orchid greenhouse is a botanical garden specialized in the cultivation, preservation and exhibition of orchids, these places require that physical variables such as ambient temperature, humidity and illuminance to be continuously monitored and controlled for the proper growth of orchids. The present work proposes the design, prototyping and deployment of a wireless sensor network for the monitoring of physical variables in the Municipal orchid greenhouse of Loja, based on open hardware technology. As a result, two prototypes were implemented: one from the variable monitoring node and the other from the central node for visualization and recording of variables. For the validation of the prototypes, performance tests were carried out in the field. Approximately 3000 samples were obtained with a 100% reliability rate in the transit of the data within the process of acquisition, transmission, reception and storage.

AB The pumping system of the Administration Board of Drinking Water and Sanitation of the Algarrobera (JAAPS-LA) is made up of a cylindrical aquifer with dimensions of 70 meters deep and 0.305 meters in diameter, the central element of this system is the submersible pump electrical, which is controlled by time. This current system has some deficiencies, among them the shortage of drinking water when the demand of the users is higher than the nominal one; and the large waste of potable water when the demand is lower than the nominal one. The present work proposes the design, implementation and integration of a monitoring and automation system applied to the JAAPS-LA pumping system, based on a wireless sensor network, open hardware and a PLC. As a result, all the modules of the system were implemented: the liquid level acquisition module in the distribution tank by means of liquid level sensors; the wireless data transmission and reception module; the drive module of the pump by means of the Programmable logic controller (PLC); and, finally, the solar-photovoltaic energy capture module. To evaluate the performance of the monitoring and automation system implemented, the behavior was monitored for 4 days, with the data obtained it was possible to verify the correct pump drive logic and the high efficiency (100%) of the communication system.

ID HARDWARE TROJANS
AB It is suggested to improve the level of security by applying the open source paradigm to the entire IT supply chain and by subjecting the resulting components to verification when required. This would lead to a new trajectory for IT product development which could even increase the efficiency of addressing novel types of hardware-oriented attacks or employing stealthy hardware features. This could require increased transparency of semiconductor fabs. For designing open hardware several nuclei already exist. The proposed path would hold particular promise for security-critical components, which could be specified in such a way as to precisely match hardware characteristics. As some components would continue to be built using existing components for some time, a generalized a priori statement about the security of the complete supply chain, such as "verified" or "proven", will initially be impossible.

AB Timely detection of cardiac arrhythmia is critical for diagnosis and treatment of heart related disorders. ECG signal provide valuble insight into heart functioning and enable diagnosis of arrhythmia conditions. An open hardware based system for the automated classification of heart conditions was developed. The Raspberry Pi 3b (RPi3b) single board computer was used to analyse the ECG signal and identify normal or abnormal heart conditions. The developed system can independently acquire ECG signals and classify arrythmia using ANN algorithm running on the RPi3b. The system was tested using MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. Realtime ECG signal acquisition and classification was also carried out.

AB The inclusion of pupils with special educational needs (SEN) in classrooms is a reality for many teachers. These professionals have a favourable attitude towards the inclusion of pupils with SEN in the regular teaching classrooms.
   An inclusive education system should be "structured and developed taking into account the diversity of characteristics of young children, different needs or problems" and for these reasons to differentiate measures.
   Special education is aimed at educational and social inclusion, educational access and success, autonomy, emotional stability, as well as the promotion of equal opportunities, preparation for continuing education or adequate preparation for the professional life and for a transition from school to employment of children and young people with permanent special educational needs".
   A particular case of SEN is that of people with autism, and they characterize autism as "a rare and serious psychiatric illness in childhood and characterized by imbalanced intellectual development that affects the ability to socialize." It is also reported in the literature that these people, with autism, have great difficulties in communicating verbal and nonverbal, while having a great difficulty in interpreting language.
   Technology-based learning, in particular through the use of visual and multimedia environments, is a facilitating tool for people with autism spectrum disorders to learn best when information is presented visually. This view is also shared by several authors when refer that to facilitate "inclusion and children / young people with SEN in today's society, Information and Communication Technologies play a fundamental role, as they facilitate a differentiated, active and collaborative intervention of all stakeholders in the life of each of these people".
   This document reports on an activity project that can be used by Educators of students with autism. Two tools are used, Makey-Makey hardware and Scratch software. The use of open-hardware microcontrollers, with no need for programming and free software, allows this project to be shared and reconverted to other topics. This work arose from a challenge of proposing an activity to be used by children with special educational needs using ICT. In a first step the bibliography related to the use of ICT in the classroom with these children and the legislation that served to obtain the first orientations was consulted. Then a specialist was consulted and then the prototype of the project was built, succinct enough that it could be replicated and perceived by these Educators.

ID LECTURERS
AB Adopting open practices in higher education bears the potential to increase quality, access and effectiveness of the educational offer of universities, as well as to improve their impact on society and reputation. Because of this, an increasing number of universities are working to mainstream the adoption of open approaches among their staff, mainly by promoting the use of open content, for example supporting their lecturers in developing Open Educational Resources (OER) or MOOCs. On the other hand, few institutions are supporting their teaching staff in adopting open practices beyond content, promoting for instance the adoption of open learning design practices, open teaching and open assessment. This approach is reflected in research on open education. If we look at scientific literature, despite the many indications that research on open education should shift its focus from open content towards a more holistic understanding of openness (including research data, licensing, technology, etc.), it appears that existing attempts to analyse openness within universities are also typically limited to open content. In order to narrow down the gap in literature, the present paper analyses the level of open practices adoption of a case-study university by taking into account a number of dimensions of openness-open design, open content, open teaching and open assessment, allowing to reach a comprehensive view of the level of opened fluency of an institution. By analysing the data collected within an Italian university, based on a cohort of 181 educators, the paper discusses the adoption of open practices within the university in terms of open design, open content, open teaching and open assessment, relating those to the characteristics of the respondents. Based on these results, the paper concludes that educators seem to select their entry point into openness depending on their preferences and on the way they interact with the institutional, technological and time constrains connected to the adoption of open practices. Because of this, any initiative aimed to mainstream the use of open practices within universities should work beyond the support to open content production, to allow the multiplicity of approaches towards openness to emerge and to build on existing capacities of staff across all dimensions of openness.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is a distributed system of physical objects that requires the integration of hardware (e.g., sensors, actuators) and network communications in order to collect and exchange data. IoT smart objects need to be identified in some way to determine the origin of the data. One of the best-positioned technologies to perform identification is RFID (Radio Frequency Identification), which has gained a lot of popularity in applications like access control, payment cards or logistics. This paper presents a RFID-based IoT Cybersecurity laboratory: it provides a guideline for understanding and analyzing in depth the RFID technology from the cybersecurity point of view. The application is based on Proxmark3, which is a suite of HW/SW tools that facilitates message eavesdropping and emulation of both tags and readers. All the software, firmware and hardware that is described here is open source and open design.

AB The Army continues the development of 3D printing technology to enhance the capability to produce smaller and lighter precision weaponry. Researchers and support organizations that are affiliated with the Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) are developing nano based structures and components for advanced weaponry, aviation, and autonomous air/ground systems applications. The first key area consists of determining in-plane and out-of-plane shear properties of test articles made by 3D printing (Fused Deposition Modeling - FDM) and comparing to the conventional extrusion/forming sheet process. Test specimens are made from three polymer materials: acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), high impact poly-styrene (HIPS), and poly-lactic acid (PLA). Laboratory testing is performed according to the ASTM D3846-02 method for determining the in-plane shear strength, while the ASTM D5379 method is used for determining the out-of-plane shear properties. A description on how the 3D printing process advances the shear properties and has the potential of improving the in-plane and cross-sectional shear properties over the conventional manufacturing process is presented. The second key area demonstrates a set of materials, processes, and techniques that support the enabling of additive manufacture (AM) of RF components. Research activities are focused on developing open-source hardware/software multi-material direct digital printing, and producing 3D printed antenna, passive components, and connectors for C-band and Ku-band systems. Material studies have demonstrated a suitable material set for RF components and identified key material performance limits. Results show how more enhancement could be achieved by optimizing the variables that affect 3D printing.

AB Because of the great popularity of the maker movement, the concept of "Do it yourself" (DIY) has gained considerable public attention. Furthermore, because of the development of rapid prototyping, the rise of open-source hardware and programming languages, the popularization of network communities, and the establishment of maker spaces, DIY has been taken to the next level: "co-creation." This concept requires reform to the standard curriculum in information and technology education. Therefore, this study aims to define the key competences of makers to construct the competence indicators of Maker Education for information and technology education in elementary school. On this basis, a curriculum can be developed, and an evaluation system for learning effectiveness can be built to equip students with the abilities to adapt to life and tackle challenges. In this study, the Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM) was applied to collect and analyze data in the form of a questionnaire survey. The subjects were 12 experts from enterprises, governmental institutions, schools and research institutes. The research achievements include 3 factors ("Theoretical knowledge," "Practical application," "Maker's mindset"), and 10 indicators.

AB Open source design (OSD) is an emerging cluster design mode based on Internet, and it takes full advantage of knowledge, technology, and resources among designers to promote product development. In this mode, designers' behaviors of collaboration have important influence on product development process. In this paper, firstly collaboration flow including two types of collaboration relations between designers in open source design is depicted. Secondly, two-phase collaborative behavior model including partner selection and response is built by means of utility functions. At last, simulation experiment including 4 scenarios is designed based on open source project of mobile phone and conducted by multiagent simulation, and contrastive analysis is carried out to study collaboration behaviors' impact on open source design process. The results show that the two-phase collaborative behavior model elaborately describes structure evolution of Open Source Community (OSC) as well as designers' collaboration behaviors and that different ways of partner selection behaviors have significant impact on the evolution of OSD process as well as OSC structure. Furthermore, the results suggest that designers should better consider more the factor of matching degree between designers but less collaboration record.

AB Millimeter-wave (mmWave) with large spectrum available is considered as the most promising frequency band for future wireless communications. The IEEE 802.11ad and IEEE 802.11ay operating on 60 GHz mmWave are the two most expected wireless local area network (WLAN) technologies for ultra-high-speed communications. For the IEEE 802.11ay standard still under development, there are plenty of proposals from companies and researchers who are involved with the IEEE 802.11ay task group. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review on the medium access control layer (MAC) related issues for the IEEE 802.11ay, some cross-layer between physical layer and MAC technologies are also included. We start with MAC related technologies in the IEEE 802.11ad and discuss design challenges on mmWave communications, leading to some MAC related technologies for the IEEE 802.11ay. We then elaborate on important design issues for IEEE 802.11ay. Specifically, we review the channel bonding and aggregation for the IEEE 802.11ay, and point out the major differences between the two technologies. Then, we describe channel access and channel allocation in the IEEE 802.11ay, including spatial sharing and interference mitigation technologies. After that, we present an in-depth survey on beamforming training, beam tracking, single-user multiple-input-multiple-output beamforming, and multi-user multiple-input-multiple-output beamforming. Finally, we discuss some open design issues and future research directions for mmWave WLANs. We hope that this paper provides a good introduction to this exciting research area for future wireless systems.

AB Designers are accustomed to solving problems that are provided to them; in fact, common practice in engineering is to present the problem with carefully delineated and detailed constraints required for a promising solution. As a consequence, engineers focus on creating feasible solutions rather than exploring novel perspectives on the presented problems. However, the Engineer of 2020 needs to respond with innovations for multiple and dynamic user needs, diverse users and cultures, and rapidly changing technologies. These complex demands require engineering students to learn that problems are not "fixed'' as presented, and to build the habit of exploring alternative perspectives on the stated problem. Creative innovations in problem understanding may lead directly to more innovative solutions. While previous research has documented the "co-evolution'' of problem and solution during the design process, the present work aims to understand how designers intentionally explore variants of problems on the way to solutions. Summaries of two empirical studies provide initial evidence about how stated problems are altered within successful solutions in open design challenges, along with evidence of problem think aloud protocols. Analysis of qualitative changes in problem perspectives reveals systematic patterns, or cognitive "heuristics,'' and these same patterns are evident as student engineers solve problems. By exploring diverse perspectives on a stated problem, engineers can incorporate innovations into both problems and solutions during the design process.

AB The usage of real-time tracking systems for vehicles has demonstrated to be a viable and economical option, entailing in more control and management of the fleet, plus the reduction of the logistics costs of companies using them. Since 2006 in Cuba, there is a fleet control and management system employed by almost all the companies, which hire a variant of the service in a differed manner; i.e., the data are not processed in real-time. In this research paper, we propose the design of a device based only on open source hardware/software components allowing the real-time vehicle tracking. Our proposal is suitable for the conditions of the country where it was developed (Cuba), presenting high functionality than other proposals. For the design, we employed an Arduino UNO controller board, an Adafruit FONA808 GPS/GSM module, and other accessories. As per the performed experiments, the proposed hardware/software architecture complies with the operation, configuration, and security requirements to achieve a viable product from the economical and environmental approaches.

AB Maker Education is a practice-oriented movement that has risen in the last decade, and emphasizes more on innovation, creativity and problem solving. Maker Education is based on knowledge, directed by creation, and is aimed at solving problems. This study, aimed at the curriculum of the Department of Information Management, expects to develop a systematic information Maker curriculum. This curriculum, combined with the 3D printing machine and Arduino open hardware configured with the STEM education framework, is designed to explore the impact of the introduction of Maker education to information curriculum of technical or vocational colleges on attitude differences and learning of STEM. Two courses, 3D model design and Arduino programming, are implemented, after the end of which, students' achievements are evaluated. The result is that male still have higher interests in science, engineering and technology than women, but Maker curriculum is multifaceted and foundational so that many people can spend a little time in learning and use various skills to produce their own works. Therefore, there is little difference between women and men in scores of achievement test.

DE Ball and plate system; Stewart platform; sliding mode control (SMC)
AB In this paper, we propose a cost-effective implementation method of a ball and plate system as an educational kit and present the application of sliding mode control to achieve better control performance. We choose a Stewart platform with rotary actuators to manipulate the plate. We explain the construction method of the platform in detail. We use a touch panel as a sensor to obtain the positional data at a high sample rate and to make the system compact. As a main control unit, we use a Nucleo-32 board, which is a small and powerful open source hardware with a built-in floating point unit. For controller synthesis, we show a mathematical model of the ball and plate system and explain the kinematics analysis of the Stewart platform. We design a sliding mode controller that includes error integration, which makes the system robust against external disturbances. We describe the results of the simulations and the experiments and then illustrate the advantage of the applied sliding mode control compared to LQ control. The proposed system is cost-effective, can be easily built, has good control performance, and occupies a small space. For these reasons, we expect that the system can be efficiently used as an educational tool.

AB This paper describes the initial development of a low-cost Lagrangian drifter based on solar panels, ultracapacitor and open hardware-software platform. The drifter is powered by a solar panel and a single Ultracapacitor that stores the energy. The drifter has a sensor suite formed by a GPS, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity sensors and a camera. The energy management and signal processing from sensors is supported by an Arduino Mega development board. The communications between the ground station and a deployed drifter is based on Iridium Satellite Terminal. All mechanical and electronic components are self-contained in a pressure housing. The main purpose of this Lagrangian drifter is: detect a red tide near Ecuadorian coasts, obtain physical-chemical parameters in-situ then send the measurements trough a satellite network to a ground station. Results from sea trials are shown.

AB In 2013 the Competition for Authenticated Encryption: Security, Applicability, and Robustness (CAESAR) was started. It aims at determining a portfolio of ciphers for authenticated encryption that has advantages over AES-GCM in terms of performance, security, and ease of implementation. This competition, for the first time, provides a standardized hardware API, which allows a fair comparison of hardware implementations. However, the community still lacks a common platform to automatically test hardware implementations, confirm implementation claims, and benchmark performance figures on real hardware in terms of runtime, area, power and energy consumption. In this work, we present a common platform using the CAESAR-API in a Xilinx Zynq-7000 System on Chip (SoC) with ARM processors and an AXI interface. This reflects a typical real world usage scenario for hardware-accelerators and thus extends the work for a fair comparison of hardware implementations in three dimensions: first the API is evaluated on a real SoC, which shows, e.g. the performance of the API. Second, it provides a hardware platform to test the proposed implementations of the candidates easily. This can be used by future designers, as we will provide it as open source hardware. Finally, we ran all published hardware implementations of the current 3rd-round candidates during which we identified several implementation weaknesses, e.g. presumably unintended latches in the design, hence emphasizing the importance of testing hardware proposals on real hardware.

AB We present an open-source robotic platform for educational use that integrates multiple levels of interaction through the use of additional vision sensor. The environment can be used in virtual, augmentedreality and real-robot modes, enabling smooth transition from a virtual robot manipulator to a real one. We describe the main aspects of our platform that ensure low production costs and encourage openness of both its hardware and software. The main goal of our work was to create a viable low-cost robotic manipulator platform alternative for the university level courses in intelligent robotics, however, the application domain is very broad.

AB There has been growing popularity in do-ityourself (DIY) electronics for wearable computing and human-machine interaction. This has introduced exciting opportunities to promote science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics (STEAM) education that highlights the intersection of electronics, materials, and artistic expression. Here, we present a systematic guide to a low-cost (<$10 per student) outreach workshop on wearable electronics for middle school students (and potentially high school students with minor modifications) that is complementary to existing STEM outreach programs. In this workshop, students use basic craft skills to fabricate a wearable human-computer interface out of commercially available materials. The device is interfaced with a computer via open source hardware and software, using the universal serial bus (USB) human interface device (HID) protocol. The workshop exposes students to wearable technologies, a rapidly growing and exciting sub-domain of the electronics industry, and provides a fun and engaging hands-on activity that draws connections between fashion, technology, and personal electronics.

AB Current debates on knowledge-based and creative locational development have come to deal with small urban places of novelty that formerly remained unnoticed. A plethora of new forms of producing and working recently emerged in unplanned and uncoordinated ways, bearing odd names such as FabLabs, Open Worklabs, Real Labs, Open Design Cities, Techshops, Repair Cafes, and more (Smith, A., M. Fressoli, D. Abrol, E. Arond, and A. Ely. 2017. Grassroots Innovation Movements. London: Routledge). Political initiatives have been taken by surprise; at the same time, standard epistemic tools of the social sciences and economics have been rendered unfit. More concise analytical reconstructions are needed to adequately capture the variety and complexity of these "labs", their heterogeneous causation, their contingent proceedings, their surplus of latency, their peculiar power relations and their local embeddings. Urban social contexts have a strong triggering function as they help to re-configure older, and create new, combinations of heterogeneous social and economic agency. Meanwhile strong elements of grassroots innovation (Smith et al. 2017) have informed the formation of various models of alternative work and production. Taking the phenotype of open workshops as a revealing example, we take assemblage theory to describe the constitutive features of these new types of self-organised work, and the associated places of innovation. A fresh gaze on the complexity and openendedness of socio-material formations may help to better understand the nature of emerging post-growth economies.

AB Highly developed drone technology enables the use of drones in a wide variety of areas. However, those drones are mainly used in the unmanned aerial vehicles. We believe that underwater drones will become a big research topic and find a market in the near future. We developed an underwater drone with a 360 degrees panoramic camera acting as the "eye" of the drone. The designs are based on the open-source hardware and will be shared as an open-source for contributing to the innovation of manufacturing including drone. The function of the 360 degrees panoramic camera is generated by correcting the images taken by two fisheye lenses. The underwater drone was designed by extending the Raspberry Pi compute module, the frame was designed by OpenSCAD, and the printed circuit board was designed by MakePro. As for the application of the underwater drone, we focused on fish recognition for investigating fish species in a natural lake to help protect the original environment. Fish recognition is based on deep learning, which is the biggest topic in the artificial intelligence research field today. Experimental results show that the function of the underwater drone achieved at diving in the leak automatically. The 360 degrees panoramic images were generated correctly. Fish recognition achieved 87% accuracy by deep learning.

AB Earthquake effects are strongly related with the properties of the local geology, amplifying the ground motion, especially in soft soils. This amplification is connected with the resonant frequency, which can be estimated applying the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (1-1/V) method on seismic noise measurements. In this work, a low-cost user-friendly data acquisition system (Geophonino-3D) has been designed for three-component seismic noise recording. The developed system consists of the signal conditioning circuit and the Arduino Due with an SD Shield for data storage. The suitability of the equipment for the application of the H/V method has been first assessed in the laboratory, according to the experimental sensitivity, the internal noise stability and the channel consistency. Subsequently, experimental verification has been carried out by recording seismic noise at eight different sites along the province of Alicante (southeast Spain), with different soil characteristics. The performance of the developed acquisition system has been evaluated in terms of the power spectral density and the H/V peaks by comparison with the results obtained through a commercial seismic recorder. The obtained results show the applicability of the developed acquisition system to record seismic noise and to apply the H/V method. Geophonino-3D is an open source and open hardware system and the price of its components is much lower than any other commercial equipment, which becomes a significant advance especially for small research groups with reduced economic support.

AB In self-powered microsystems, a power management is essential to extract, transfer and regulate power from energy harvesting sources to loads such as sensors. The challenge is to consider all of the different structures and components available and build the optimal power management on a microscale. The purpose of this paper is to streamline the design process by creating a novel reconfigurable testbed called Medlay. First, we propose a uniform interface for management functions e.g., power conversion, energy storing and power routing. This interface results in a clear layout because power and status pins are strictly separated, and inputs and outputs have fixed positions. Medlay is the ready-to-use and open-hardware platform based on the interface. It consists of a base board and small modules incorporating e.g., dc-dc converters, power switches and supercapacitors. Measurements confirm that Medlay represents a system on one circuit board, as parasitic effects of the interconnections are negligible. The versatility regarding different setups on the testbed is determined to over 250,000 combinations by layout graph grammar. Lastly, we underline the applicability by recreating three state-of-the-art systems with the testbed. In conclusion, Medlay facilitates building and testing power management in a very compact, clear and extensible fashion.

AB Research Findings: Digital play is now commonplace in many young children's lives, but not in preschool settings. This situation is likely due to the fact that the existent literature seldom highlights what digital play looks like, the various ways it can be situated, and what young children do when they play together with digital devices in the preschool setting. The present study addresses this limitation by providing a close examination of the social interactions of young children as they engage with different types of iPad apps and each other. Observational data of 20 dyads of children during digital play analyzed qualitatively revealed that children exhibited a range of social behaviors from competitive to collaborative as they engaged in 4 types of digital play: practice/task, exploratory, construction, and pretense. Forms of play and exhibited behaviors were shaped by interrelated factors of children's individual characteristics and relationships, classroom culture and routines, adult views and actions, as well as aspects of the digital device itself. Practice or Policy: Selecting open-design apps, attending to digital play structures, and monitoring peer play more closely may lessen competition, enhance collaboration, and lead to more complex digital play.

AB Background: In patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) two open pilot studies about the effects of 35% carbon dioxide (CO2) exist. One shows an augmented panicogenic and anxiogenic response (Muhtz et al., 2011), the other does not (Talesnik et al. 2007). We further characterized the CO2 reactivity in PTSD using for the first time placebo-controlled and double-blind conditions.
   Methods: In 20 patients with PTSD we assessed panic, anxiety, dissociative and PTSD symptoms after a single vital capacity inhalation of 35% CO2 compared to a placebo gas condition in a within-participant cross-over, placebo-controlled, double-blind and randomized design.
   Results: Inhalation of 35% CO2 versus placebo provoked significantly increased panic, anxiety, dissociative and PTSD symptoms. The reaction to placebo gas was minimal. Order of inhalation, patients' sex or age did not influence the results. The panic and anxiety response under CO2 was considerably higher in the PTSD patients than in healthy controls from our previous open study.
   Conclusions: The results corroborate that our preceding findings of an increased CO2 reactivity in patients with PTSD are not false positive due to the open design or the lack of placebo control. Replication in a larger number of PTSD patients and matched control subjects is needed. The potential role of childhood traumatisation, psychiatric comorbidity, psychotropic medication and trait dissociation in prior contradictory reports should be clarified.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to answer the following two questions: What are the influences of the top managers' different leadership styles on organizational innovation? What is the mechanism by which the different leaderships exert different effects on organizational innovation?
   Design/methodology/approach - To test the hypothesized model, a data set based on 133 MBA part-time students from Tsinghua University and Zhejiang University in China was built, after interviewing several top managers as a pilot study. With the help of SPSS macro, hierarchical regression and bootstrapping analysis, the paper analyzes the effects of two leadership styles on innovation performance, through the mediation mechanism of openness involving open breadth and open depth.
   Findings - The results indicate that transformational leadership enhances, while transactional leadership reduces, the organizational innovation performance. The openness breadth and openness depth not only mediate the beneficial effect of transformational leadership on innovation, but also mediate the deleterious effect of transactional leadership on innovation.
   Originality/value - This study empirically explores the different functions of transformational leadership and transactional leadership for leading organizational innovation performance. Furthermore, a new form of organization is an open design or strategy that allows more external knowledge and resources to be absorbed, which is claimed as a new paradigm for organization innovation. This study integrates the concepts of breadth of openness and depth of openness on the basis of open innovation literature, as an intermediate mechanism to explain the different effects of the two forms of top managers' leadership.

AB Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics (STEAM) education is perceived as difficult and many students either do not choose or give up studying these subjects. NEWTON is a large European Union project which develops STEAM content and innovative solutions for technology-enhanced learning, validating them with diverse audiences, which include primary, secondary, university and special learning students in pilots deployed in multiple locations across Europe. These technologies include digital fabrication tools in conjunction with different learning approaches as self-directed, game-based and problem-based learning methods to increase learner quality of experience improving learning programs.
   This paper describes a small-scale pilot leaded by Fab Lab Madrid CEU and deployed at Madrid based CEU Monteprincipe School, that will be also run at St. Patrick's School in Dublin (Ireland) and Liceo Scientifico G. Da Procida in Salerno (Italy) in a second stage. It targets the use of a digital fabrication laboratory for STEAM education, as a support tool for students to test remote access to digital fabrication facilities and effectiveness of a Fab Lab to develop among students problem solving, bringing emotion and motivation into activity designs and raising their interest for Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics.

AB IP-XACT is the most used standard in IP (Intellectual Property) integration. It is intended as a language neutral golden reference, from which RTL and HW dependent SW is automatically generated. Despite its wide popularity in the industry, there are practically no public and open design examples for any part of the design flow from IP-XACT to synthesis. One reason is the difficulty of creating IP-XACT models for existing RTL projects. In this paper, we address the issues by modeling the PULPino RISC-V microprocessor that is written in SystemVerilog (SV) and the project distributed over several repositories. We propose how to solve the mismatching concepts between SV project and IP-XACT, and based on the findings propose improvements for the Kactus2 IP-XACT tool. In addition, the final PULPino model contributes to the rare public non-trivial examples for better adoption of the IP-XACT methodology.

AB We present an open hardware and software platform to efficiently fuse heterogeneous sensor data in an automotive/robotic context. The framework presented in this paper provides researchers a base platform in order to develop and evaluate sensor fusion strategies. In contrast to similar approaches, this framework exploits in particular the raw radar data and enables the fusion at low-level.
   The proposed system utilizes low-level data from radar sensors as well as indirect (e.g. 3D imaging) and direct (e.g. LIDAR) Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors. After a configurable amount of pre-processing at sensor-level, the sensor data is transferred to a centralized platform and aligned temporally and spatially. We demonstrate the transformation of radar data into the 3D coordinate system in order to fuse it with point cloud data from ToF sensors. Due to the modular structure of the framework, it also enables the exploration of various system partitioning concepts.

AB An anaphylactic shock constitutes a representative scenario for critical paramedical cases that happen too rare to eventually occur within a regular curricular term of vocational training. As a possible solution, this paper presents EPICSAVE, a development case that yields novel training tools using multi-user virtual reality (VR) and serious game methodology. The case describes the interdisciplinary setup and iterative workflow of the development of a simulation prototype. Examples show design tools and methodologies, e.g., finding focus in medical treatment. Results from two pilot studies indicate that specifically multi-user VR may enhance paramedic training. The subsequently developed prototype offers collaborative training for two paramedic trainees and one trainer. Results from a user study with paramedic trainees indicate that experiencing a positive VR training outcome depends on high presence effects and is limited by usability issues. We provide a list of open design and usability issues that shall help to improve future integration of multi-user VR in training facilities.

AB During the last decade, the local manufacturing of small wind turbines is becoming an increasingly common approach in rural electrification applications, especially among international networks of renewable energy practitioners. As the number of locally manufactured small wind turbine installations is increasing on all continents, supply chain issues, material shortages or design issues in custom applications are becoming evident. In this paper the development of a series of open access design and analysis tools is presented, which allows the local manufacturer to redesign the small wind turbine according to available materials. In the two case studies, the design tools are used in the field by practitioners in order to overcome supply chain issues during the implementation and design phases of rural electrification projects in Ethiopia and Nepal.

AB Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) has attracted many users and researchers to apply the technique for various usages. However, EMS products for research purpose are limited and open source hardware still has limitations. We present a multi-channel EMS toolkit for researchers and designers to develop their original ideas. The toolkit was designed to have isolated multiple channels to be manipulated simultaneously, which allows simultaneous control of multiple body parts and multiple users. We organized a workshop with a theme of human augmentation, where EMS was not compelled to use. As a result, several groups found interest in using EMS for their development, and participants successfully used our toolkit for their presentation. We found that multi-channel EMS has a significant demand for human augmentation purposes.

AB This paper presents HIVE, a new open source design toolbox, which focuses on teaching concepts of Energy and Climate Systems integration in buildings. .The aim is to empower architecture students to integrate aspects of energy efficiency during the architectural design process. The tool employs a simplified input format designed for ease of use and provides almost instantaneous, direct feedback to support students of all experience levels in the early, conceptual building design stages, where numerous iterations need to be conducted efficiently within a short period of time. The project aims to create a robust toolbox that will become an innovative reference in architecture and engineering - lectures, design studios, and project-based learning - through its capacity to quickly, and effectively, translate building energy systems concepts into graphic formats central to building design teaching and practice. The fast feedback that the users receive to their design parameters changes will enable an effective and quick build-up of tacit knowledge about building energy systems, complementary to the explicit, theoretical knowledge that is usually taught in courses, thus creating a more complete learning experience.

AB Modern technologies of nowadays permanently ask for continual modification of teaching methods especially in the field of computer science. If teacher and students would like to follow the latest trends in this fast-growing and quick-changing area, teaching methods should be permanently developed. Technologies as Internet of Things (IoT), Web Design, Machine Learning or other current machineries constantly suffer from the lack of talented and skilled developers to independently manage and execute such projects. The situation reflects, on the one hand, to the deficiency of students willing to study these areas, on the other hand, to the ability of teachers to successfully adapt new trends from these areas into the education process. Based on our experience, it is possible to claim, that students can be easily motivated to work at all kind of applications if a way of their engagement is entertaining and pleasurable. Small and cheap mobile robotic platforms can serve this purpose. When the students can play with something what provides real feedback to them - blinking LED diode, lighting-up display, turning motors - they are motivated to work on it and consequently to learn something. It is called teaching by experience. With regards to mentioned, our team developed and introduced the mobile robotic platform applicable for showing the students basic principles of IoT application development. Upon the simple tasks, students first learn how to, through an introduced application programming interface (API), operate all the robot hardware. Afterwards they are headed for setting up their first application when they need to set up the server application and graphical user interface (GUI), implement the communication protocol and program the robot logic. The paper describes the platform in detail as well as the first experiences with its puffing into practice.

AB Yrobot is an open hardware platform developed by authors of this paper for students of computer science field of study. It was spread across high schools and universities in Slovakia for the purposes of teaching electronics and microcontrollers programming. The platform serves the purpose of a kit on which students can step-by-step gather some basic knowledge about the problematic of embedded systems development. They learn how to write, compile and transfer the code from computer into the microcontroller, as well as how to access all robot peripherals and how to implement the programming logic. C and C++ programming languages are used for this purpose. After the students goes through all programming tasks, they are skilled enough and pushed to design their own shield for Yrobot - supplementary hardware which provides additional functionality for the robot. The shield is connected via the expansion connectors to the robot and obviously improves the robot operation. In this paper, the implementation process of RaspberryPi extension for Yrobot is described. Such extension enables interconnection between the robot and RapberryPi which serves sufficient computing power enabling the robot of a real-time computer vision. Upon such prerequisites, special application which allows the robot to recognize the traffic signs was developed. On this application students gathered special knowledge of how to work with OpenCV library.

AB We have attempted to create affordable programmable logical controllers (PLC) that can be used to train millions of students in developing countries. Version 1 of the PLC is based on AtMega16 and costs (sic)600 ($10). Using the free and open source software (FOSS) LD Micro, one can learn ladder logic. To enhance the capabilities, using Raspberry PI, Version 2 of the PLC, costing (sic)1,500 ($25) is made. We can use this device with the FOSS OpenPLC to learn ladder logic. We can also learn function block based programming using the FOSS 4DIAC. As ladder logic and function block based programming are industrial standards, students trained using our approach will be useful to industry.

AB After a long-term debate and almost two years of legislative work, the Revenue Registry Act was adopted in the Czech Republic. The first and main reason for introducing the revenue registry was the lack of instruments of the Tax Administration to fight tax evasions. The second reason was the elimination of unfair competition based on gain of undue advantage by not paying the value added tax (VAT) and the income tax. The system of the revenue registry in the Czech Republic is founded on several principles that distinguish it from other systems based on a cash register or other systems of electronic evidence. The revenue registry is based on the principles of electronisation, on-line access of tax administrator to information, the possibility of voluntary public involvement into oversight and open hardware and software solution. Unfortunately, shortly after the adoption by the Parliament, the group of legislators started a case at the Constitutional Court, demanding the abolition of the Revenue Registry Act or at least some parts of the Act because of its unconstitutionality. They were partially successful and now the Ministry of Finance has been tasked with the preparation of an amendment to the Act. The goal of this contribution is to briefly introduce and describe the Revenue Registry Act, critically analyse the fundamental provisions of the Act, summarize pros and cons of the regulation, critically analyse the decision of the Constitutional Court and introduce the Ministry's proposal of amendments. The hypothesis that the electronic revenue registry is an effective tool for fair tax payments was neither confirmed nor disproved: The electronic revenue registry might be an effective tool for fair tax payments, but only in case of unified rules for all businessmen. The higher the number of exemptions is, the less effective tool the revenue registry is.

AB This research addresses the grave issue of plastic waste in the Pacific. By using Samoa as a case study, it was considered that distributed recycling combined with 3D printing offers an opportunity to (1) repurpose and add new value to this difficult waste stream and (2) engage diverse local communities in Samoa by combining notions of participatory design with traditional Samoan social concepts. Fieldwork in Samoa established the scope of the issue through interviews with stakeholders in government, waste management businesses, the arts and crafts community and education. Based on the information obtained from the fieldwork, potential product areas and designs were explored through material and 3D printing experiments using low-cost, open- source equipment. The experiments informed the design of speculative scenarios for workable, economically viable, socially empowering and sustainable systems for repurposing and upcycling plastic waste, which then enabled production of practically useful and culturally meaningful 3D printed objects, artefacts and products. Building upon the outcome and with a view towards implementation, Creative Pathways, an educational initiative aimed at propagating 3D printing and contextual design, was established and is being delivered in local schools.

AB The boreal forest ecosystem of Alberta is increasingly affected by the human development related to natural-resource extraction, pipelines, roads and seismic lines. To evaluate the efficiency of restoration treatments, this project aims at the monitoring of physical conditions and human/wildlife presence on a recovered seismic lines ecosystem. For monitoring human and animal uses of industrial linear features, an Internet of Things (IoT) prototype system is developed with open source hardware, and open interoperable IoT standard. We try to build an accurate and cost-effective tool to detect the impact of human footprint and monitor the habit of the wild animal. So we implemented four types of trail counter which is a low-cost, open-source measurement device that counts pedestrian, bikes, all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), cars, and animals on trails, paths, and sidewalks.

AB We have conceived, built, and operated a cryogenic Penning trap with an electrically conducting yet optically transparent solid electrode. The trap, dedicated to spectroscopy and imaging of confined particles under large solid angles, is of "half-open" design with one open endcap and one closed endcap that mainly consists of a glass window coated with a highly transparent conductive layer. This arrangement allows for the trapping of externally or internally produced particles and yields flexible access for optical excitation and efficient light collection from the trapping region. At the same time, it is electrically closed and ensures long-term ion confinement under well-defined conditions. With its superior surface quality and its high as well as homogeneous optical transmission, the window electrode is an excellent replacement for partially transmissive electrodes that use holes, slits, metallic meshes, and the like.

AB STUDY QUESTION: Is there a difference in live birth rate and/or cost-effectiveness between antral follicle count (AFC)-based individualized FSH dosing or standard FSH dosing in women starting IVF or ICSI treatment?
   SUMMARY ANSWER: In women initiating IVF/ICSI, AFC-based individualized FSH dosing does not improve live birth rates or reduce costs as compared to a standard FSH dose.
   WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: In IVF or ICSI, ovarian reserve testing is often used to adjust the FSH dose in order to normalize ovarian response and optimize live birth rates. However, no robust evidence for the (cost-) effectiveness of this practice exists.
   STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Between May 2011 and May 2014 we performed a multicentre prospective cohort study with two embedded RCTs in women scheduled for IVF/ICSI. Based on the AFC, women entered into one of the two RCTs (RCT1: AFC < 11; RCT2: AFC > 15) or the cohort (AFC 11-15). The primary outcome was ongoing pregnancy achieved within 18 months after randomization resulting in a live birth (delivery of at least one live foetus after 24 weeks of gestation). Data from the cohort with weight 0.5 were combined with both RCTs in order to conduct a strategy analysis. Potential half-integer numbers were rounded up. Differences in costs and effects between the two treatment strategies were compared by bootstrapping.
   PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: In both RCTs women were randomized to an individualized (RCT1: 450/225 IU, RCT2: 100 IU) or standard FSH dose (150 IU). Women in the cohort all received the standard dose (150 IU). Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) was measured to assess AMH post-hoc as a biomarker to individualize treatment. For RCT1 dose adjustment was allowed in subsequent cycles based on pre-specified criteria in the standard group only. For RCT2 dose adjustment was allowed in subsequent cycles in both groups. Both effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the strategies were evaluated from an intention-to-treat perspective.
   MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: We included 1515 women, of whom 483 (31.9%) entered the cohort, 511 (33.7%) RCT1 and 521 (34.4%) RCT2. Live births occurred in 420/747 (56.3%) women in the individualized strategy and 447/769 (58.2%) women in the standard strategy (risk difference -0.019 (95% CI, -0.06 to 0.02), P = 0.39; a total of 1516 women due to rounding up the half integer numbers). The individualized strategy was more expensive (delta costs/woman = (sic)275 (95% CI, 40 to 499)). Individualized dosing reduced the occurrence of mild and moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and subsequently the costs for management of these OHSS categories (costs saved/woman were (sic)35). The analysis based on AMH as a tool for dose individualization suggested comparable results.
   LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Despite a training programme, the AFC might have suffered from inter-observer variation. In addition, although strict cancel criteria were provided, selective cancelling in the individualized dose group (for poor response in particular) cannot be excluded as observers were not blinded for the FSH dose and small dose adjustments were allowed in subsequent cycles. However, as both first cycle live birth rates and cumulative live birth rates show no difference between strategies, the open design probably did not mask a potential benefit for the individualized group. Despite increasing consensus on using GnRH antagonist co-treatment in women predicted for a hyper response in particular, GnRH agonists were used in almost 80% of the women in this study. Hence, in those women, the AFC and bloodsampling for the post-hoc AMH analysis were performed during pituitary suppression. As the correlation between AFC and ovarian response is not compromised during GnRH agonist use, this will probably not have influenced classification of response.
   WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Individualized FSH dosing for the IVF/ICSI population as a whole should not be pursued as it does not improve live birth rates and it increases costs. Women scheduled for IVF/ICSI with a regular menstrual cycle are therefore recommended a standard FSH starting dose of 150 IU per day. Still, safety management by individualized dosing in predicted hyper responders is open for further research.

AB STUDY QUESTION: Does an increased FSH dose result in higher cumulative live birth rates in women with a predicted poor ovarian response, apparent from a low antral follicle count (AFC), scheduled for IVF or ICSI?
   SUMMARY ANSWER: In women with a predicted poor ovarian response (AFC < 11) undergoing IVF/ICSI, an increased FSH dose (225/450 IU/day) does not improve cumulative live birth rates as compared to a standard dose (150 IU/day).
   WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: In women scheduled for IVF/ICSI, an ovarian reserve test (ORT) can predict ovarian response to stimulation. The FSH starting dose is often adjusted based on the ORT from the belief that it will improve live birth rates. However, the existing RCTs on this topic, most of which show no benefit, are underpowered.
   STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Between May 2011 and May 2014, we performed an open-label multicentre RCT in women with an AFC < 11 (Dutch Trial Register NTR2657). The primary outcome was ongoing pregnancy achieved within 18 months after randomization and resulting in a live birth. We needed 300 women to assess whether an increased dose strategy would increase the cumulative live birth rate from 25 to 40% (two-sided alpha-error 0.05, power 80%).
   PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Women with an AFC <= 7 were randomized to an FSH dose of 450 IU/day or 150 IU/day, and women with an AFC 8-10 were randomized to 225 IU or 150 IU/day. In the standard group, dose adjustment was allowed in subsequent cycles based on pre-specified criteria. Both effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the strategies were evaluated from an intention-to-treat perspective.
   MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: In total, 511 women were randomized, 234 with an AFC <= 7 and 277 with an AFC 8-10. The cumulative live birth rate for increased versus standard dosing was 42.4% (106/250) versus 44.8% (117/261), respectively [relative risk (RR): 0.95 (95% CI, 0.78-1.15), P = 0.58]. As an increased dose strategy was more expensive [delta costs/woman: (sic)1099 (95% CI, 562-1591)], standard FSH dosing was the dominant strategy in our economic analysis.
   LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Despite our training programme, the AFC might have suffered from inter-observer variation. As this open study permitted small dose adjustments between cycles, potential selective cancelling of cycles in women treated with 150 IU could have influenced the cumulative results. However, since first cycle live birth rates point in the same direction we consider it unlikely that the open design masked a potential benefit for the individualized strategy.
   WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Since an increased dose in women scheduled for IVF/ICSI with a predicted poor response (AFC < 11) does not improve live birth rates and is more expensive, we recommend using a standard dose of 150 IU/day in these women.

   METAANALYSIS
AB STUDY QUESTION: Does a reduced FSH dose in women with a predicted hyper response, apparent from a high antral follicle count (AFC), who are scheduled for IVF/ICSI lead to a different outcome with respect to cumulative live birth rate and safety?
   SUMMARY ANSWER: Although in women with a predicted hyper response (AFC > 15) undergoing IVF/ICSI a reduced FSH dose (100 IU per day) results in similar cumulative live birth rates and a lower occurrence of any grade of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) as compared to a standard dose (150 IU/day), a higher first cycle cancellation rate and similar severe OHSS rate were observed.
   WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Excessive ovarian response to controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) for IVF/ICSI may result in increased rates of cycle cancellation, the occurrence of OHSS and suboptimal live birth rates. In women scheduled for IVF/ICSI, an ovarian reserve test (ORT) can be used to predict response to COS. No consensus has been reached on whether ORT-based FSH dosing improves effectiveness and safety in women with a predicted hyper response.
   STUDY DESIGN SIZE, DURATION: Between May 2011 and May 2014, we performed an open-label, multicentre RCT in women with regular menstrual cycles and an AFC > 15. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (Rotterdam criteria) were excluded. The primary outcome was ongoing pregnancy achieved within 18 months after randomization and resulting in a live birth. Secondary outcomes included the occurrence of OHSS and cost-effectiveness. Since this RCT was embedded in a cohort study assessing over 1500 women, we expected to randomize 300 predicted hyper responders.
   PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Women with an AFC > 15 were randomized to an FSH dose of 100 IU or 150 IU/day. In both groups, dose adjustment was allowed in subsequent cycles (maximum 25 IU in the reduced and 50 IU in the standard group) based on pre-specified criteria. Both effectiveness and cost-effectiveness were evaluated from an intention-to-treat perspective.
   MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: We randomized 255 women to a daily FSH dose of 100 IU and 266 women to a daily FSH dose of 150 IU. The cumulative live birth rate was 66.3% (169/255) in the reduced versus 69.5% (185/266) in the standard group (relative risk (RR) 0.95 [95% CI, 0.85-1.07], P = 0.423). The occurrence of any grade of OHSS was lower after a lower FSH dose (5.2% versus 11.8%, RR 0.44 [95% CI, 0.28-0.71], P = 0.001), but the occurrence of severe OHSS did not differ (1.3% versus 1.1%, RR 1.25 [95% CI, 0.38-4.07], P = 0.728). As dose reduction was not less expensive ((sic)4.622 versus (sic)4.714, delta costs/woman (sic)92 [95% CI, -479-325]), there was no dominant strategy in the economic analysis.
   LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Despite our training programme, the AFC might have suffered from inter-observer variation. Although strict cancellation criteria were provided, selective cancelling in the reduced dose group (for poor response in particular) cannot be excluded as observers were not blinded for the FSH dose and small dose adjustments were allowed in subsequent cycles. However, as first cycle live birth rates did not differ from the cumulative results, the open design probably did not mask a potential benefit for the reduced dosing group. As this RCT was embedded in a larger cohort study, the power in this study was unavoidably lower than it should be. Participants had a relatively low BMI from an international perspective, which may limit generalization of the findings.
   WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: In women with a predicted hyper response scheduled for IVF/ICSI, a reduced FSH dose does not affect live birth rates. A lower FSH dose did reduce the incidence of mild and moderate OHSS, but had no impact on severe OHSS. Future research into ORT-based dosing in women with a predicted hyper response should compare various safety management strategies and should be powered on a clinically relevant safety outcome while assessing non-inferiority towards live birth rates.

AB Excluding the ion source, an ion mobility spectrometer is fundamentally comprised of drift chamber, ion gate, pulsing electronics, and a mechanism for amplifying and recording ion signals. Historically, the solutions to each of these challenges have been custom and rarely replicated exactly. For the IMS research community few detailed resources exist that explicitly detail the construction and operation of ion mobility systems. In an effort to address this knowledge gap we outline a solution to one of the key aspects of a drift tube ion mobility system, the ion gate pulser. Bradbury-Nielsen or Tyndall ion gates are found in nearly every research-grade and commercial IMS system. While conceptually simple, these gate structures often require custom, high-voltage, floating electronics. In this report we detail the operation and performance characteristics of a wifi-enabled, MOSFET-based pulser design that uses a lithium-polymer battery and does not require high voltage isolation transformers. Currently, each output of this circuit follows a TTL signal with similar to 20 ns rise and fall times, pulses up to +/- 200 V, and is entirely isolated using fiber optics. Detailed schematics and source code are provided to enable continued use of robust pulsing electronics that ease experimental efforts for future comparison.

ID OPEN-SOURCE HARDWARE; MICROSCOPY PLATFORM; PROTEIN; BRIGHT
AB The advent of easy-to-use open source microcontrollers, off-the-shelf electronics and customizable manufacturing technologies has facilitated the development of inexpensive scientific devices and laboratory equipment. In this study, we describe an imaging system that integrates low-cost and open-source hardware, software and genetic resources. The multi-fluorescence imaging system consists of readily available 470 nm LEDs, a Raspberry Pi camera and a set of filters made with low cost acrylics. This device allows imaging in scales ranging from single colonies to entire plates. We developed a set of genetic components (e.g. promoters, coding sequences, terminators) and vectors following the standard framework of Golden Gate, which allowed the fabrication of genetic constructs in a combinatorial, low cost and robust manner. In order to provide simultaneous imaging of multiple wavelength signals, we screened a series of long stokes shift fluorescent proteins that could be combined with cyan/green fluorescent proteins. We found CyOFP1, mBeRFP and sfGFP to be the most compatible set for 3-channel fluorescent imaging. We developed open source Python code to operate the hardware to run time-lapse experiments with automated control of illumination and camera and a Python module to analyze data and extract meaningful biological information. To demonstrate the potential application of this integral system, we tested its performance on a diverse range of imaging assays often used in disciplines such as microbial ecology, microbiology and synthetic biology. We also assessed its potential use in a high school environment to teach biology, hardware design, optics, and programming. Together, these results demonstrate the successful integration of open source hardware, software, genetic resources and customizable manufacturing to obtain a powerful, low cost and robust system for education, scientific research and bioengineering. All the resources developed here are available under open source licenses.

TI Evaluation of an open source method for calculating physical activity in
   dogs from harness and collar based sensors
SO BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Dogs; Physical activity; Accelerometer; Harness; Collar; Exercise;
   Sensor
ID ACCELEROMETER
AB Background: The ability to make objective measurements of physical activity in dogs has both clinical and research applications. Accelerometers offer a non-intrusive and convenient solution. Of the commercialy available sensors, measurements are commonly given in manufacturer bespoke units and calculated with closed source approaches. Furthermore, the validation studies that exist for such devices are mounting location dependant, not transferable between brands or not suitable for handling modern raw accelerometry type data.
   Methods: This paper describes a validation study of n = 5 where 4 sensors were placed on each dog; 2 on a harness and 2 on a collar. Each position held two sensors from different manufacturers; Actigraph (which has previously been validated for use on the collar) and VetSens (which provides un-filtered accelerometry data). The aims of the study was to firstly evaluate the performance of an open-design method of converting raw accelerometry data into units that have previously been validated. Secondly, comparison was made between sensors mounted at each location for determining physical activity state.
   Results: Once the raw actigraphy data had been processed with the open-design method, results from a 7 day measurement revealed no significant difference in physical activity estimates via a cutpoint approach between the sensor manufacturers. A second finding was a low inter-site variability between the ventral collar and dorsal harness locations (Pearsons r(2) = 0.96).
   Conclusions: Using the open-design methodology, raw, un-filtered data from the VetSens sensors can be compared or pooled with data gathered from Actigraph sensors. The results also provide strong evidence that ventral collar and dorsal harness sites may be used interchangeably. This enables studies to be designed with a larger inclusion criteria (encompassing dogs that are not well suited for wearing an instrumented collar) and ensures high levels of welfare while maintaining measurement validity.

AB This paper focuses on the application of rapid prototyping techniques using additive manufacturing in combination with parametric design to create low-cost, yet accurate and reliable instruments. The methodology followed makes it possible to make instruments with a degree of customization until now available only to a narrow audience, helping democratize science. The proposal discusses a holistic design-for-manufacturing approach that comprises advanced modeling techniques, open-source design strategies, and an optimization algorithm using free parametric software for both professional and educational purposes. The design and fabrication of an instrument for scattering measurement is used as a case of study to present the previous concepts.

TI Data-Driven Sizing Specification Utilizing Consumer Text Reviews
SO JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN
LA English
DT Review
ID ONLINE PRODUCT REVIEWS; DESIGN
AB The objective of this work is to introduce a new method for determining preliminary design specifications related to human-artifact interaction. This new method uses data mining of large numbers of consumer reviews. User opinion on specific product features can be time-consuming or expensive to obtain through traditional methods including surveys, experiments, and observational studies. Data mining review text of already released products may be a potentially less time consuming and costly method. Previously established methods of determining design for human variability information from consumer reviews, such as the frequency and accuracy summation (FAS) number and subsequent manual analysis, are explored. The weighted phrase rating (WPR), a new metric which can be an automated tool to quickly analyze consumer reviews, is also introduced. It does not require manual parsing of the reviews, which extends its applicability to larger review pools. This new method is shown to quickly and economically provide information useful to the establishment of design specifications.

AB A laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) was used as a complimentary detection system for time-of-flight ion mobility spectrometry (TOF-IMS). A LIF detection system is potentially faster than a conventional electrometer detector and can provide additional (to usual for IMS drift time) analytical information, namely wavelength of fluorescence maxima and fluorescence lifetime. Therefore, better discrimination ability can be expected. Additionally, the combination of IMS and LIF operates at atmospheric pressure. This allows fluorescence measurements of specified ions and ion clusters, which would not survive in a mass spectrometer. An IMS drift cell of open design with both the electrometer and LIF detectors was designed. The feasibility of IMS-LIF was demonstrated on the example of the Xanthene dye Rhodamine 6G (R6G). Electrospray was used as an ionization source. The release and desolvation of R6G ions from the electrospray with following IMS-LIF analysis were demonstrated. The effects of experimental parameters (e.g., ion gate and drift voltages, distance to ESI emitter) are demonstrated and discussed. The obtained results are promising enough to ensure the potential of LIF as a complimentary/alternative detection system for time-of-flight ion mobility spectrometry.

AB Despite its long history of technological development, much charcoal production still relies on polluting and inefficient technologies utilizing traditional kiln designs. In addition to the need for improved charcoal production systems, the growing interest globally in pyrolysis of biomass to generate biochar as a soil fertility improver and for climate change mitigation may drive an increasing demand for such technologies. Accordingly, there is a clear need in developing countries for access to safe, affordable, and efficient open-source designs and technology that can be fabricated locally. The design described here includes computational fluid dynamics modeling which demonstrated that the design exhibits a stable flow and combustion pattern. A hazard and operability (HAZOP) study, mass and energy modeling, and costing of all components and fabrication were also conducted for a prototype kiln that will accept up to 250 kg biomass h(-1). Fabrication and installation costs were estimated using actual commercial quotations based on detailed engineering drawings and design, and were found to be $580 000 for a 250 kg h(-1) unit. We therefore find that this pyrolysis system promises to be economical on a small scale. It can utilize waste lignocellulosic materials for feedstock, thus alleviating demand pressure on woodlands to provide feedstocks. It was, therefore, concluded that the pyrolysis unit described here promises to provide an affordable and efficient open-source design that can be fabricated locally in developing countries without licensing restrictions or royalties.

AB The business models of digital maker-entrepreneurs in open design are inextricably linked to the broader open design community. Digital makers share designs on online platforms such as Thingiverse and use digital manufacturing technology such as 3-D printing as a generative mechanism for their entrepreneurial activities. There is a general understanding of how sharing works in that community and the basic design parameters that determine the business models of these digital maker-entrepreneurs, which are based on a portfolio of activities. This study is based on in-depth interviews with 11 digital maker-entrepreneurs from the open design community. We investigate the activities that constitute their business models using activity theory as a lens with which better to understand them. This study provides a perspective on the complexity of the relationships in which these activities are embedded and analyzes the activities related to the production, distribution, and consumption of value. Finally, we examine the exchanges between digital maker entrepreneurs in the community, shedding light on how digital maker-entrepreneurs share and exchange goods, services, and knowledge as peers.

AB This article describes a complete characterization system for photovoltaic devices designed to acquire the current-voltage curve and to process the obtained data. The proposed system can be replicated for educational or research purposes without having wide knowledge about electronic engineering. Using standard calibrated instrumentation, commonly available in any laboratory, the accuracy of measurements is ensured. A capacitive load is used to bias the device due to its versatility and simplicity. The system includes a common part and an interchangeable part that must be designed depending on the electrical characteristics of each PV device. Control software, developed in LabVIEW, controls the equipment, performs automatic campaigns of measurements, and performs additional calculations in real time. These include different procedures to extrapolate the measurements to standard test conditions and methods to obtain the intrinsic parameters of the single diode model. A deep analysis of the uncertainty of measurement is also provided. Finally, the proposed system is validated by comparing the results obtained from some commercial photovoltaic modules to the measurements given by an independently accredited laboratory.

Information and Communications Technology are called on to be one of the key players to get these cities to use smart devices and sensors (Internet of Things) to know at every moment what is happening within the city, in order to make decisions that will improve the management of resources.
   The proliferation of these "smart things" is producing significant deployment of networks in the city context. Most of these devices are proprietary solutions, which do not offer free access to the data they provide. Therefore, this prevents the interoperability and compatibility of these solutions in the current smart city developments.
   This paper presents how to embed an open sensorized platform for both hardware and software in the context of a smart city, more specifically in a university campus. For this integration, GlScience comes into play, where it offers different open standards that allow full control over "smart things" as an agile and interoperable way to achieve this. To test our system, we have deployed a network of different sensorized platforms inside the university campus, in order to monitor environmental phenomena. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This letter presents the depth control of an autonomous micro diving agent called autonomous diving agent (ADA). ADA consists of off-the-shelf components and features open-source hardware and firmware. It can be deployed as a testbed for depth controllers, as well as a mobile sensor platform for research or in industrial tanks. We introduce a control law that is based on the feedback linearization method and enhanced by an adaptive fuzzy algorithm to cope with modeling inaccuracies. The proposed depth controller is computationally light enough to run on ADAs embedded hardware. In experiments performed in a wave tank, the adaptive fuzzy scheme shows the ability to deal with both depth regulation and depth profile tracking. ADA is even able to hold on to dynamic isobars despite external disturbances. We demonstrate that under the influence of waves, ADA describes orbital motions similar to water particles.

AB Working together, heated and unheated temperature sensors can recognize contact with different materials and contact with the human body. As such, distributing these sensors across a robot's body could be beneficial for operation in human environments. We present a stretchable fabric-based skin with force and thermal sensors that is suitable for covering areas of a robot's body, including curved surfaces. It also adds a layer of compliance that conforms to manipulated objects, improving thermal sensing. Our open hardware design addresses thermal sensing challenges, such as the time to heat the sensors, the efficiency of sensing, and the distribution of sensors across the skin. It incorporates small self-heated temperature sensors on the surface of the skin that directly make contact with objects, improving the sensors' response times. Our approach seeks to fully cover the robot's body with large force sensors, but treats temperature sensors as small, point-like sensors sparsely distributed across the skin. We present a mathematical model to help predict how many of these point-like temperature sensors should be used in order to increase the likelihood of them making contact with an object. To evaluate our design, we conducted tests in which a robot arm used a cylindrical end effector covered with skin to slide objects and press on objects made from four different materials. After assessing the safety of our design, we also had the robot make contact with the forearms and clothed shoulders of 10 human participants. With 2.0 s of contact, the actively-heated temperature sensors enabled binary classification accuracy over 90% for the majority of material pairs. The system could more rapidly distinguish between materials with large differences in their thermal effusivities (e.g., 90% accuracy for pine wood vs. aluminum with 0.5 s of contact). For discrimination between humans vs. the four materials, the skin's force and thermal sensing modalities achieved 93% classification accuracy with 0.5 s of contact. Overall, our results suggest that our skin design could enable robots to recognize contact with distinct task-relevant materials and humans while performing manipulation tasks in human environments.

AB As the open source development of additive manufacturing has led to low-cost desktop three-dimensional (3-D) printing, a number of scientists throughout the world have begun to share digital designs of free and open source scientific hardware. Open source scientific hardware enables custom experimentation, laboratory control, rapid upgrading, transparent maintenance, and lower costs in general. To aid in this trend, this study describes the development, design, assembly, and operation of a 3-D printable open source desktop nutating mixer, which provides a fixed 20 degrees platform tilt angle for a gentle three-dimensional (gyrating) agitation of chemical or biological samples (e.g., DNA or blood samples) without foam formation. The custom components for the nutating mixer are designed using open source FreeCAD software to enable customization. All of the non-readily available components can be fabricated with a low-cost RepRap 3-D printer using an open source software tool chain from common thermoplastics. All of the designs are open sourced and can be configured to add more functionality to the equipment in the future. It is relatively easy to assemble and is accessible to both the science education of younger students as well as state-of-the-art research laboratories. Overall, the open source nutating mixer can be fabricated with US$37 in parts, which is 1/10th of the cost of proprietary nutating mixers with similar capabilities. The open source nature of the device allow it to be easily repaired or upgraded with digital files, as well as to accommodate custom sample sizes and mixing velocities with minimal additional costs.

AB This paper presents a data acquisition unit which synchronously samples multiple channels in a manner such that the time of day at which each sample is taken is known. This allows measurements taken at multiple locations to be compared with confidence. The intended application is wide area electrical power system measurements, in particular phasor measurement units (PMUs). The novelty of the authors' design is the application of an open hardware development platform to discipline a commodity analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to a broadcast time signal, usually but not exclusively GPS. The methodology used creates a driver layer for the ADC to achieve real-time sampling in a nonpreemptive Linux environment. The use of open hardware and software addresses the need for a transparent instrument for use in research and development of PMU technology. Through a choice of either a software or hardware phase-locked loop, the ADC is controlled to acquire exactly 256 samples per nominal power system cycle (i. e., 50/60 Hz), precisely time synchronized to GPS, at 16-b resolution and 94.2-dB SNR. The design of a printed circuit board expansion board featuring all necessary components is provided. The performance of the system is evaluated. Interoperability and data exchange with other systems is achieved by use of open schemas and communication protocols. This allows rapid integration with popular numerical simulation environments.

AB In the era of the forth Industrial Revolution, open source code and open source hardware have gained much attention. In particular, 3D printing technology is expanding into the realms of classical science, technology and our daily lives. Relatedly, in the present study, we demonstrate the manufacture of a nano-LC MALDI spotter robot using 3D printing technology. The parts of the spotter robot were either made using a 3D printer or purchased as 3D printer parts from the 3D printer online market, so that anyone can make the robot without a deep knowledge of engineering or electronics, i.e., DIY (do-it-yourself) product. In the nano-LC MALDI spotter, the nano-LC eluent and MALDI matrix were mixed in a T-union and discharged from the capillary outlet. The eluent and matrix mixture could be spotted onto the movable MALDI plate. The MALDI plate was designed to translate in a two-dimensional space (xy plane), which was enabled by the movements of two stepper motors. In the paper, all computer-aided design (CAD) files for the parts and operation software are provided to help the reader manufacture their own spotter robot.

AB Zebrafish is a vertebrate animal model. Their maintenance in large number under laboratory conditions is a daunting task. Commercially available recirculating zebrafish maintenance systems are used to efficiently handle the tasks of automatic sediment cleaning from zebrafish tanks with minimal waste of water. Due to their compact nature, they also ensure the maximal use of available lab space. However, the high costs of commercial systems present a limitation to researchers with limited funds. A cost-effective zebrafish maintenance system with major features offered by commercially available systems is highly desirable. Here, we describe a compact and recirculating zebrafish maintenance system. Our system is composed of cost-effective components, which are available in local markets and/or can be procured via online vendors. Depending on the expertise of end users, the system can be assembled in 2 days. The system is completely customizable as it offers geometry independent zebrafish tanks that are capable of auto-cleaning the sediments. Due to these features, we called our setup as Open-RAC (Open-design, Recirculating and Auto-Cleaning zebrafish maintenance system). Open-RAC is a cost-effective and viable alternative to the currently available zebrafish maintenance systems. Thus, we believe that the use of Open-RAC could promote the zebrafish research by removing the cost barrier for researchers.

AB Objective. Closed-loop experiments, in which causal interventions are conditioned on the state of the system under investigation, have become increasingly common in neuroscience. Such experiments can have a high degree of explanatory power, but they require a precise implementation that can be difficult to replicate across laboratories. We sought to overcome this limitation by building open-source software that makes it easier to develop and share algorithms for closed-loop control. Approach. We created the Open Ephys GUI, an opensource platform for multichannel electrophysiology experiments. In addition to the standard 'open-loop' visualization and recording functionality, the GUI also includes modules for delivering feedback in response to events detected in the incoming data stream. Importantly, these modules can be built and shared as plugins, which makes it possible for users to extend the functionality of the GUI through a simple API, without having to understand the inner workings of the entire application. Main results. In combination with low-cost, open-source hardware for amplifying and digitizing neural signals, the GUI has been used for closedloop experiments that perturb the hippocampal theta rhythm in a phase-specific manner. Significance. The Open Ephys GUI is the first widely used application for multichannel electrophysiology that leverages a plugin-based workflow. We hope that it will lower the barrier to entry for electrophysiologists who wish to incorporate real-time feedback into their research.

TI OPTiM: Optical projection tomography integrated microscope using
   open-source hardware and software
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB We describe the implementation of an OPT plate to perform optical projection tomography (OPT) on a commercial wide-field inverted microscope, using our open-source hardware and software. The OPT plate includes a tilt adjustment for alignment and a stepper motor for sample rotation as required by standard projection tomography. Depending on magnification requirements, three methods of performing OPT are detailed using this adaptor plate: a conventional direct OPT method requiring only the addition of a limiting aperture behind the objective lens; an external optical-relay method allowing conventional OPT to be performed at magnifications >4x; a remote focal scanning and region-of-interest method for improved spatial resolution OPT (up to similar to 1.6 mu m). All three methods use the microscope's existing incoherent light source (i.e. arc-lamp) and all of its inherent functionality is maintained for day-to-day use. OPT acquisitions are performed on in vivo zebrafish embryos to demonstrate the implementations' viability.

AB We demonstrate continuous high-throughput selective capture of circulating tumor cells by dielectrophoresis at arrays of wireless electrodes (bipolar electrodes, BPEs). The use of BPEs removes the requirement of ohmic contact to individual array elements, thus enabling otherwise unattainable device formats. Capacitive charging of the electrical double layer at opposing ends of each BPE allows an AC electric field to be transmitted across the entire device. Here, two such designs are described and evaluated. In the first design, BPEs interconnect parallel microchannels. Pockets extruding from either side of the microchannels volumetrically control the number of cells captured at each BPE tip and enhance trapping. High-fidelity single-cell capture was achieved when the pocket dimensions were matched to those of the cells. A second, open design allows many non-targeted cells to pass through. These devices enable high-throughput capture of rare cells and single-cell analysis.

AB Small, genetically tractable species such as larval zebrafish, Drosophila, or Caenorhabditis elegans have become key model organisms in modern neuroscience. In addition to their low maintenance costs and easy sharing of strains across labs, one key appeal is the possibility to monitor single or groups of animals in a behavioural arena while controlling the activity of select neurons using optogenetic or thermogenetic tools. However, the purchase of a commercial solution for these types of experiments, including an appropriate camera system as well as a controlled behavioural arena, can be costly. Here, we present a low-cost and modular open-source alternative called 'FlyPi'. Our design is based on a 3D-printed mainframe, a Raspberry Pi computer, and high-definition camera system as well as Arduino-based optical and thermal control circuits. Depending on the configuration, FlyPi can be assembled for well under (sic)100 and features optional modules for light-emitting diode (LED)-based fluorescence microscopy and optogenetic stimulation as well as a Peltier-based temperature stimulator for thermogenetics. The complete version with all modules costs approximately (sic)200 or substantially less if the user is prepared to 'shop around'. All functions of FlyPi can be controlled through a custom-written graphical user interface. To demonstrate FlyPi's capabilities, we present its use in a series of state-of-the-art neurogenetics experiments. In addition, we demonstrate FlyPi's utility as a medical diagnostic tool as well as a teaching aid at Neurogenetics courses held at several African universities. Taken together, the low cost and modular nature as well as fully open design of FlyPi make it a highly versatile tool in a range of applications, including the classroom, diagnostic centres, and research labs.

AB Most initiatives about embedded sensing capabilities in computational systems lead to devise an ad hoc sensor platform, usually poorly reusable, as a first stage to prepare a data corpus or production prototype. In this paper, an open source hardware platform for sensing is described. This platform was intended to be used in data acquisition for gait identification, and is designed in a way general enough so many other projects could reuse the design to accelerate prototyping. The platform is based on popular open source hardware and software like Arduino and Raspberry Pi using well known languages and libraries. Some experimental results about the throughput of the overall system are reported showing the feasibility of acquiring data from up to 6 sensors with a sampling frequency no less than 118 Hz.

AB Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) is increasingly being the choice to strengthen health information systems (HIS) in Low and Middle Income Country (LMIC) contexts. FOSS is becoming a commercially viable option in today's software industry. In LMIC context, bridging the gap between generic open source design and specific local contexts calls for the participation of multi-sector stakeholders to realise FOSS implementations. This multi-sector stakeholder network, together with the FOSS platform can be theorised to form a software ecosystem (SE) around FOSS implementations in a resource constrained setting.
   In this new paradigm, governing the open source acquisition and implementation process becomes a central challenge, which is distinct from the governance of open source developer communities. This paper attempts to identify the essential stakeholder categories involved in FOSS HIS implementations in a LMIC context and; to understand the stakeholder interactions in this SE at different stages. The analysis is based on a longitudinal case study of two open source HIS implementations and an attempt to establish a FOSS governance body in the State health sector of Sri Lanka during the period 2011-2014. The paper contributes by suggesting a model to understand the essential stakeholder categories and their interactions in FOSS implementation SE in resource constrained settings.

AB Since 2001, the departments of Electrical and Electronics and Information and Communication Electronics Engineering of Faculty of Engineering, the University of Tokyo (UTokyo) have jointly given a lecture on autonomous electronic information devices for undergraduate students. According to the on-line questionnaire, 80% of students in 2010-2012 replied that the lecture was useful for their future career. The task given to students was to design and realise an autonomous electronic information devices (so-called the IoT-gadgets') by themselves, and conduct a live demonstration in front of their colleagues. The device must have an input', output', and some information processing'. Being aware of the speed of technology evolution as well as the short hours of the lecture, the professor tried not to give direct answers to students' questions on how-to instantly build and program an information device. Instead, the students were told to beware of their methods'. This refers to the deductive thinking introduced by Rene Descartes, and in the lecture's context how students should behave in order to realise the device. In this study, the backgrounds of various associated topics are discussed, such as the UTokyo's educational system, the world's rapid prototyping movement, open hardware, course design, students' reactions, and future directions.

AB Fluidized bed thermochemical conversion of biomass (combustion, gasification, pyrolysis) displays a long record of successes, spanning from lab- to industrial scales, and stems out as the most viable pathway for the exploitation of biogenic fuels, either alone or in combination with fossil fuels. In spite of its diffusion, there are still open design and operational issues that are largely related to segregation and mixing of solid and gas phases in fluidized beds and effectiveness of multiphase contacting patterns. The common claim of fluidized beds being well stirred/well controlled environments for heterogeneous and gas-phase reactions falls short when applied to processing of biomass fuels.
   This study aims at providing a comprehensive framework of fundamental phenomena affecting mixing/ segregation of phases during thermochemical processing of biomass and of their interlinks. The basic processes include patterns and kinetics of biomass devolatilization, particle and volatile matter (VM) segregation along and across the reaction chamber, particle attrition/fragmentation and generation of fine particulates, the diversity of gasification patterns and rates, as related to chemical composition and morphology of the parent biogenic fuels. Segregation brings about important consequences in terms of temperature uniformity, of proper control of heterogeneous and gas-phase reaction pathways, of ash behaviour, of pollutant emissions, of plant operability and dependability. Measures to counteract segregation, including pre-processing of biomass and/or appropriate control of bed hydrodynamics, will also be surveyed from the fundamental and applied standpoints.

AB In engineering, traditional approaches aimed at teaching concepts of dynamics to engineering students include the study of a dense yet sequential theoretical development of proofs and exercises. Structural dynamics are seldom taught experimentally in laboratories since these facilities should be provided with expensive equipment such as wave generators, data-acquisition systems, and heavily wired deployments with sensors. In this paper, the design of an experimental experience in the classroom based upon digital fabrication and modeling tools related to structural dynamics is presented. In particular, all experimental deployments are conceived with low-cost, open-source equipment. The hardware includes Arduino-based open-source electronics whereas the software is based upon object-oriented open-source codes for the development of physical simulations. The set of experiments and the physical simulations are reproducible and scalable in classroom-based environments.

AB Eclosion in flies and other insects is a circadian-gated behaviour under control of a central and a peripheral clock. It is not influenced by the motivational state of an animal, and thus presents an ideal paradigm to study the relation and signalling pathways between central and peripheral clocks, and downstream peptidergic regulatory systems. Little is known, however, about eclosion rhythmicity under natural conditions, and research into this direction is hampered by the physically closed design of current eclosion monitoring systems.
   We describe a novel open eclosion monitoring system (WEclMon) that allows the puparia to come into direct contact with light, temperature and humidity. We demonstrate that the system can be used both in the laboratory and outdoors, and shows a performance similar to commercial closed funnel-type monitors. Data analysis is semi-automated based on a macro toolset for the open imaging software Fiji. Due to its open design, the WEclMon is also well suited for optogenetic experiments. A small screen to identify putative neuroendocrine signals mediating time from the central clock to initiate eclosion showed that optogenetic activation of ETH-, EH and myosuppressin neurons can induce precocious eclosion. Genetic ablation of myosuppressin-expressing neurons did, however, not affect eclosion rhythmicity.

AB In the past decades, bioassays and whole-organism bioassay have become important tools not only in compliance testing of industrial chemicals and plant protection products, but also in the monitoring of environmental quality. With few exceptions, such test systems are discontinuous. They require exposure of the biological test material in small units, such as multiwell plates, during prolonged incubation periods, and do not allow online read-outs. It is mostly due to these shortcomings that applications in continuous monitoring of, e.g., drinking or surface water quality are largely missing. We propose the use of pipetting robots that can be used to automatically exchange samples in multiwell plates with fresh samples in a semi-static manner, as a potential solution to overcome these limitations. In this study, we developed a simple and low-cost, versatile pipetting robot constructed partly using open source hardware that has a small footprint and can be used for online monitoring of water quality by means of an automated whole-organism bioassay. We tested its precision in automated 2-fold dilution series and used it for exposure of zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio) a common model species in ecotoxicology to cadmium chloride and permethrin. We found that, compared to conventional static or semi-static exposure scenarios, effects of the two chemicals in zebrafish embryos generally occurred at lower concentrations, and analytically verified that the increased frequency of media exchange resulted in a greater availability of the chemical. In combination with advanced detection systems this custom-made pipetting robot has the potential to become a valuable tool in future monitoring strategies for drinking and surface water.

AB This paper explores questions of leadership in navigating the futures of material production from the point of view of the open source and peer-to-peer movement. It puts forward the idea of cosmo-localization, which in basic terms sees a new production logic emerging from the advent of a global design commons coupled to new manufacturing technologies that democratize production. The study first uses the futures triangle to map the various factors at play. It then brings together the thinking of P.R. Sarkar and Michel Bauwens, exploring questions of leadership in the development of this new model. The study ends with three brief scenarios, drawing on the scenario logic developed by Johan Galtung, that proposes potential future states based on the resolution of critical contradictions.

AB Concentrated solar power (CSP) plants are increasingly gaining interest as a source of renewable energy. These plants face several technical problems and the inspection of components such as absorber tubes in parabolic trough concentrators (PTC), which are widely deployed, is necessary to guarantee plant efficiency. This article presents a system for real-time industrial inspection of CSP plants using low-cost, open-source components in conjunction with a thermographic sensor and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The system, available in open-source hardware and software, is designed to be employed independently of the type of device used for inspection (laptop, smartphone, tablet or smartglasses) and its operating system. Several UAV flight missions were programmed as follows: flight altitudes at 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 m above ground level; and three cruising speeds: 5, 7 and 10 m/s. These settings were chosen and analyzed in order to optimize inspection time. The results indicate that it is possible to perform inspections by an UAV in real time at CSP plants as a means of detecting anomalous absorber tubes and improving the effectiveness of methodologies currently being utilized. Moreover, aside from thermographic sensors, this contribution can be applied to other sensors and can be used in a broad range of applications where real-time georeferenced data visualization is necessary.

AB As low-cost desktop 3D printing is now dominated by free and open source self-replicating rapid prototype (RepRap) derivatives, there is an intense interest in extending the scope of potential applications to manufacturing. This study describes a manufacturing technology that enables a constrained set of polymer-metal composite components. This paper provides (1) free and open source hardware and (2) software for printing systems that achieves metal wire embedment into a polymer matrix 3D-printed part via a novel weaving and wrapping method using (3) OpenSCAD and parametric coding for customized g-code commands. Composite parts are evaluated from the technical viability of manufacturing and quality. The results show that utilizing a multi-polymer head system for multi-component manufacturing reduces manufacturing time and reduces the embodied energy of manufacturing. Finally, it is concluded that an open source software and hardware tool chain can provide low-cost industrial manufacturing of complex metal-polymer composite-based products.

AB We are developing room temperature electronics based upon the ROACH platform to readout microwave multiplexed X-ray TES. ROACH is an open-source hardware and software platform featuring a large Xilinx Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), Power PC processor, several 10 GB Ethernet SFP+ interfaces, and a collection of daughter boards for analog signal generation and acquisition. The combination of a ROACH board, ADC/DAC conversion daughter boards, and hardware for RF mixing allows for the generation and capture of multiple RF tones for reading out microwave multiplexed X-ray TES microcalorimeters. The FPGA is used to generate multiple tones in base band, from 10 MHz to 250 MHz, which are subsequently mixed to RF in the multiple GHz range and sent through the microwave multiplexer. The tones are generated in theFPGAby storing a large lookup table in Quad Data Rate SRAM modules and playing out the waveform to a DAC board. Once the signal has been modulated to RF, passed through the microwave multiplexer, and has been modulated back to base band, the signal is digitized by an ADC board. The tones are modulated to 0 Hz by using a FPGA circuit consisting of a polyphase filter bank, several Xilinx FFT blocks, Xilinx CORDIC blocks (for converting to magnitude and phase), and special phase accumulator circuit for mixing to exactly 0 Hz. Upwards of 256 channels can be simultaneously captured and written into a bank of 256 First-In-First-Out (FIFO) memories, with each FIFO corresponding to a channel. Individual channel data can be further processed in the FPGA before being streamed through a 10 GB Ethernet fiber-optic interface to a Linux system. The Linux system runs software written in Python and QT C++ for controlling the ROACH system, capturing data, and processing data.

TI Openspritzer: an open hardware pressure ejection system for reliably
   delivering picolitre volumes
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
AB The ability to reliably and precisely deliver picolitre volumes is an important component of biological research. Here we describe a high-performance, low-cost, open hardware pressure ejection system (Openspritzer), which can be constructed from off the shelf components. The device is capable of delivering minute doses of reagents to a wide range of biological and chemical systems. In this work, we characterise the performance of the device and compare it to a popular commercial system using twophoton fluorescence microscopy. We found that Openspritzer provides the same level of control over delivered reagent dose as the commercial system. Next, we demonstrate the utility of Openspritzer in a series of standard neurobiological applications. First, we used Openspritzer to deliver precise amounts of reagents to hippocampal neurons to elicit time-and dose-precise responses on neuronal voltage. Second, we used Openspritzer to deliver infectious viral and bacterial agents to living tissue. This included viral transfection of hippocampal interneurons with channelrhodopsin for the optogenetic manipulation of hippocampal circuitry with light. We anticipate that due to its high performance and low cost Openspritzer will be of interest to a broad range of researchers working in the life and physical sciences.

AB Objective: To determine the effectiveness of a parent health report on fruit and vegetable consumption among preschoolers and kindergarteners.
   Design: Pre-post open design trial and a randomized controlled trial.
   Setting: A university-sponsored preschool and kindergarten.
   Participants: A total of 63 parents of preschool and kindergarten students participated in the pre-post open design trial and 65 parents participated in the randomized controlled trial.
   Intervention: Parents in intervention groups were given a parent health report providing information about their child's fruit and vegetable intake as well as recommendations for how to increase their child's fruit and vegetable consumption.
   Main Outcome Measure: Change in fruit and vegetable consumption. Analysis: Latent growth curve modeling with Bayesian estimation.
   Results: Vegetable consumption increased by 0.3 servings/d in the open trial and 0.65 servings/d in the randomized trial. Fruit consumption did not increase significantly in either study.
   Conclusions and Implications: Results from both an open trial and a randomized controlled trial suggested that the parent health report may be a beneficial tool to increase vegetable consumption in preschoolers and kindergarteners. Increases in vegetable consumption can lead to the establishment of lifelong habits of healthy vegetable intake and decrease risk for chronic diseases.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Sorting is an extremely important computation kernel that has been accelerated in a lot of fields such as databases, image processing, and genome analysis. Given that advent of Internet of Things (IoT) era due to mobile technology progressions, the future needs a sorting method that is available on any environment, such as not only high performance systems like servers but also low computational performance machines like embedded systems. In this paper, we present an FPGA-based sorting accelerator combining Sorting Network and Merge Sorter Tree, which is customizable by means of tuning design parameters. The proposed FPGA accelerator sorts data sent from a host PC via the PCIe bus, and sends back the fully sorted data sequence to it. We also present a detailed analytical model that accurately estimates the sorting performance. Due to these characteristics, designers can know how fast a developed sorting hardware is in advance and can implement the best one to fulfill the cost and performance constraints. Our experiments show that the proposed hardware achieves up to 19.5x sorting performance, compared with Intel Core i7-3770K operating at 3.50GHz, when sorting 256M 32-bits integer elements. However, this result is limited because of insufficient memory bandwidth. To overcome this problem, we propose a data compression mechanism and the experimental result shows that the sorting hardware with it achieves almost 90% of the estimated performance, while the hardware without it does about 60%. In order to allow every designer to easily and freely use this accelerator, the RTL source code is released as open-source hardware.

AB This paper shows new possibilities of using novel, open-source, low-cost platforms for the structural health monitoring of heritage structures. The objective of the study is to present an assessment of increasingly available open-source digital modeling and fabrication technologies in order to identify the suitable counterparts of the typical components of a continuous static monitoring system for a historical construction. The results of the research include a simple case study, which is presented with low-cost, open-source, calibrated components, as well as an assessment of different alternatives for deploying basic structural health monitoring arrangements. The results of the research show the great potential of these existing technologies that may help to promote a widespread and cost-efficient monitoring of the built cultural heritage. Such scenario may contribute to the onset of commonplace digital records of historical constructions in an open-source, versatile and reliable fashion. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB We describe the use of a low-cost commercial flatbed scanner in the undergraduate teaching laboratory to image large (similar to 25 cm) interference and diffraction patterns in two dimensions. Such scanners usually have an 8-bit linear photosensor array that can scan large areas (similar to 28 cm x 22 cm) at very high spatial resolutions (similar to 100 Megapixels), which makes them versatile large-format imaging devices. We describe how the scanner can be used to image interference and diffraction from rectangular single-slit, double-slit, and circular apertures. The experiments are very simple to setup and require no specialized components besides a small laser and a flatbed scanner. Due to the presence of Automatic Gain Control in the scanner, which we were not able to override, we were unable to get an excellent fit to the data. Interestingly, we found that the less-than-ideal data were actually pedagogically superior as it forced the students to think about the process of data acquisition in much greater detail instead of simply performing the experiment mechanically.

AB Isaac Newton famously observed that "if I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants." We propose that this sentiment is a powerful motivation for the "open-source" movement in scientific research, in which creators provide everything needed to replicate a given project online, as well as providing explicit permission for users to use, improve, and share it with others. Here, we write to introduce analytical chemists who are new to the open-source movement to best practices and concepts in this area and to survey the state of open source research in analytical chemistry. We conclude by considering two examples of open-source projects from our own research group, with the hope that a description of the process, motivations, and results will provide a convincing argument about the benefits that this movement brings to both creators and users.

AB We are surrounded by increasingly complex networks of smart objects, yet our understanding and attachment to them is rather limited. One way to support stronger end users' engagement with such complex technologies is by involving them in the design process and, with the advent of Arduino prototyping platform, even in their making. While DIY practice offers the potential for stronger user engagement with physical artifacts, we know little about end users' DIY practice of making complex electronic technologies and their potential to ensure engagement with such devices. In this article, we report on interviews with 18 participants from two green communities who built and used an open source DIY energy monitor, with the aim to explore the end users DIY practices of making such complex electronic devices. Findings indicate four key qualities of DIY monitors: transparent modularity, open-endedness, heirloom, and disruptiveness, and how they contribute to more meaningful engagement with the DIY monitors, elevating them from the status of unremarkable objects to that of things. We conclude with three implications for design for supporting end user development of complex electronic DIY: designing transparent open hardware technologies, standardizing communication protocols for the current and future DIY of IoT, and deliberately calling for personal investment and labor in the assembling of DIY kits.

AB Implantable neuronal interfaces to the brain are an important keystone for future medical applications. However, entering this field of research is difficult since such an implant requires components from many different areas of technology. Since the complete avoidance of wires is important due to the risk of infections and other long-term problems, means for wirelessly transmitting data and energy are a necessity which adds to the requirements. In recent literature, many high-tech components for such implants are presented with remarkable properties. However, these components are typically not freely available for such a system. Every group needs to re-develop their own solution. This raises the question if it is possible to create a reusable design for an implant and its external base-station, such that it allows other groups to use it as a starting point. In this article, we try to answer this question by presenting a design based exclusively on commercial off-the-shelf components and studying the properties of the resulting system. Following this idea, we present a fully wireless neuronal implant for simultaneously measuring electrocorticography signals at 128 locations from the surface of the brain. All design files are available as open source.

AB Three-dimensional (3D) printing technology is considered to be a major driving innovation in tissue engineering, since a custom-made manufacturing for patients is essential for tissue and organ generation. Depending on the bio-materials and the applications, various 3D bio-printing technologies are used. A system capable of printing a variety of bio-materials through various methods is required for fabrication of hybrid scaffolds for tissue engineering research. This paper describes the design and integration of a multi-channel 3D bio-printing system at an affordable price based on open source hardware and software. The hardware and software components of the 3D bio-printing system and the process of finding optimal printing conditions are described in the paper. Fabrication of the hybrid scaffold of synthetic polymer and cell loaded hydrogel are presented to validate the performance of the system.

DE Modular MOOCs; Digital badges; Completion rates
AB Much is made of the diversity for MOOCs learners-with their varied motivations and interests; yet MOOCs are often run and judged on the assumption that learners would progress through the course in its entirety, to completion. This paper presents an analysis of three recently delivered MOOCs that were designed to support a broader set of learner goals. A modular design was used, where each part included well defined learning outcomes and assessment criteria, and where completion was rewarded with digital badges. The paper proposes a new categorisation of learner achievement and methods of visualising learner behaviour that compliment this more open design. Results show that this approach recognises micro-learning that is missed if only completion rates are considered.

AB The Internet of Things, or the IoT, is an emerging, disruptive technology that enables physical devices to communicate across disparate networks. IP has been the de facto standard for seamless interconnectivity in the traditional Internet; and piggybacking on the success of IP, 6LoWPAN has been the first standardized technology to realize it for networks of resource-constrained devices. In the recent past Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) a.k.a Bluetooth Smart - a subset of the Bluetooth v4.0 and the latest v4.2 stack, has surfaced as an appealing alternative, with many competing advantages over available low-power communication technologies in the IoT space such as IEEE 802.15.4. However, BLE is a closed standard and lacks open hardware and firmware support, something that hinders innovation and development in this field. In this article, we aim to overcome some of the constraints in BLE's core building blocks by making three contributions: first, we present the design of a new open hardware platform for BLE; second, we provide a Contiki O.S. port for the new platform; and third, we identify research challenges and opportunities in 6LoWPAN-connected Bluetooth Smart. We believe that the knowledge and insights will facilitate IoT innovations based on this promising technology. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI A mobile sensor network to map carbon dioxide emissions in urban
   environments
SO ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
LA English
DT Article
AB A method for directly measuring carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions using a mobile sensor network in cities at fine spatial resolution was developed and tested. First, a com-pact, mobile system was built using an infrared gas analyzer combined with open-source hardware to control, georeference, and log measurements of CO2 mixing ratios on ve-hicles (car, bicycles). Second, two measurement campaigns, one in summer and one in winter (heating season) were carried out. Five mobile sensors were deployed within a 1x12.7 km transect across the city of Vancouver, BC, Canada. The sensors were operated for 3.5 h on pre-defined routes to map CO2 mixing ratios at street level, which were then averaged to 100 x 100m grid cells. The averaged CO2 mixing ratios of all grids in the study area were 417.9 ppm in summer and 442.5 ppm in winter. In both campaigns, mixing ratios were highest in the grid cells of the downtown core and along arterial roads and lowest in parks and well vegetated residential areas. Third, an aerodynamic resistance approach to calculating emissions was used to derive CO2 emissions from the gridded CO2 mixing ratio mea-surements in conjunction with mixing ratios and fluxes collected from a 28 m tall eddycovariance tower located within the study area. These measured emissions showed a range of 12 to 226CO(2) ha 1 h 1 in summer and of -14 to 163 kgCO(2) ha 1 h 1 in winter, with an average of 35.1 kgCO(2) ha (-1) h (-1) (summer) and 25.9 kgCO(2) ha 1 h 1 (winter). Fourth, an independent emissions inventory was developed for the study area using buildings energy simulations from a previous study and routinely available traffic counts. The emissions inventory for the same area averaged to 22.06 kgCO(2) ha (-1) h (-1) (summer) and 28.76 kgCO(2) ha (-1) h (-1) (winter) and was used to compare against the measured emissions from the mobile sensor network. The comparison on a grid-by-grid basis showed linearity between CO2 mixing ratios and the emissions inventory (R (2) =53 in summer and R (2) = 47 in winter). Also, 87% (summer) and 94% (winter) of measured grid cells show a difference within +/- 1 order of magnitude, and 49% (summer) and 69% (winter) show an error of less than a factor 2. Although associated with considerable errors at the individual grid cell level, the study demonstrates a promising method of using a network of mobile sensors and an aerody-namic resistance approach to rapidly map greenhouse gases at high spatial resolution across cities. The method could be improved by longer measurements and a refined calculation of the aerodynamic resistance.

AB In this study, we introduce a modulation strategy for comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC) by using a simple and consumable-free modulator. This "Do-It-Yourself" interface comprised a 1.0 mx0.25 mm segment of MTX-5 metallic column and a low-cost DC power supply. Thermal desorption modulation (TDM) was attained using a dual-stage heater-based modulator in a novel segmented-loop configuration. TDM was achieved by alternating analyte trapping and thermal desorption. Former process relied on analyte partition to sorbent phase, while latter explored direct resistive heating. Introduction of an intermediate delay segment between the two stages mitigated analyte breakthrough, improving peak symmetry and chromatographic efficiency. This feature was critical to acquire reliable GCxGC modulation using such simple heater-based device. The effects of important modulation variables on 2D separations were investigated, including TDM stage length, dimension of delay loop, and outlet pressure. Significant advances and limitations of proposed TDM strategy were carefully determined. Proposed GCxGC prototype by using an in-oven TDM modulator was successfully applied to a series of challenging matrices, including petroleum distillates, biodiesel, and essential oil. This open-hardware, cost-effective modulator was easy to install and operate, as it circumvented the need for sophisticated components (e.g. moving parts and cooling systems). Therefore, our modulator is a compelling alternative to existing GCxGC solutions to operate in resource-limited laboratories.

AB Three dimensional (3d) printer technologies are rapidly developing and increasingly being used in several fields. In this study, as a first step a 3d printer is constructed by modifying open source hardware and controlled by improving open source software. Subsequently, an ankle foot orthosis (AFO) is designed and constructed by using this 3d printer.
   The ankle foot orthosis, very important for human walking, is designed to control motion of the ankle and prevents deformities. An AFO can generally be used for following purposes: brace weak limbs, grasp ankle and foot in the right position and correct the foot drop. Since the users have different sizes of ankles and different types of deformities, an AFO must be produced to match in size to the end-user. Therefore off-the-shelf AFOs may not suitable for the each end user. Considering these factors, 3d printers are of great importance for producing individualized biomedical equipment. In this study, a distinctive ankle foot orthosis is first modelled by using CAD software and then produced by using constructed 3d printer. This AFO is the first ankle foot orthosis produced by a 3d printer in the literature of our country. This study is a proof that biomedical equipments can be produced in a shorter time and less costly by using 3d printers.

AB Theories of knowledge reuse posit two distinct processes: reuse for replication and reuse for innovation. We identify another distinct process, reuse for customization. Reuse for customization is a process in which designers manipulate the parameters of metamodels to produce models that fulfill their personal needs. We test hypotheses about reuse for customization in Thingiverse, a community of designers that shares files for three-dimensional printing. 3D metamodels are reused more often than the 3D models they generate. The reuse of metamodels is amplified when the metamodels are created by designers with greater community experience. Metamodels make the community's design knowledge available for reuse for customization-or further extension of the metamodels, a kind of reuse for innovation.

AB A portable probe based on open hardware architecture for the assessment of soil thermal properties and water content using the DPHP method is presented. The mean percentage errors for assessment of volumetric heat capacity and thermal conductivity were 4.6% and 8.9% respectively, computed after sensor spacing calibration in agar stabilized water. The DPHP probe has been tested for soil thermal properties assessment and compared to TDR probe for the water content estimation in four different soils.
   The DPHP probe showed an accuracy comparable to TDR in estimating water content, with DPHP showing lower values of error index in 3 samples out of 4. The DPHP can be used to investigate smaller volume of soil than TDR probe can do however, TDR is much faster than DPHP in measure acquisition. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This work proposes a system for collecting meteorological data using a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), that is able to transmit data in real-time. The system automatizes the process of collecting the data in a continuous manner for long periods of time, for this, the module is equipped with a source of solar energy that allows autonomous operation. In order to obtain viability of design and prototype implementation, the construction of two systems was proposed based on DigiMesh and Wi-Fi; those prototypes could be applied to different scenarios such as urban and rural areas. Additionally, it was performed an evaluation of broadcasting of information to platforms of Internet of Things (IoT), where the data collected by the nodes will be managed and displayed. This system was conceived as a low-cost alternative compared with conventional weather stations that offer these facilities and are based on free hardware and software components. Finally, the validation of the obtained results was performed using a statistical analysis with the collected data of the weather station Davis Vantage Pro, obtaining a maximum average relative error of 4.93%.

AB Scientists have begun using self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) 3-D printers to manufacture open source digital designs of scientific equipment. This approach is refined here to develop a novel instrument capable of performing automated large-area four-point probe measurements. The designs for conversion of a RepRap 3-D printer to a 2-D open source four-point probe (OS4PP) measurement device are detailed for the mechanical and electrical systems. Free and open source software and firmware are developed to operate the tool. The OS4PP was validated against a wide range of discrete resistors and indium tin oxide (ITO) samples of different thicknesses both pre- and post-annealing. The OS4PP was then compared to two commercial proprietary systems. Results of resistors from 10 to 1 M show errors of less than 1% for the OS4PP. The 3-D mapping of sheet resistance of ITO samples successfully demonstrated the automated capability to measure non-uniformities in large-area samples. The results indicate that all measured values are within the same order of magnitude when compared to two proprietary measurement systems. In conclusion, the OS4PP system, which costs less than 70% of manual proprietary systems, is comparable electrically while offering automated 100 micron positional accuracy for measuring sheet resistance over larger areas.

AB Computer science (CS) is becoming an increasingly diverse domain. This paper reports on an initiative designed to introduce underrepresented populations to computing using an eclectic, multifaceted approach. As part of a yearlong computing course, students engage in Maker activities, participatory simulations, and computing projects that foreground the social and collaborative aspects of CS. Collectively, these activities are designed to introduce learners to the growing diversity of what CS looks like in the 21st century. This paper lays out the practical and theoretical motivations for the Computational Thinking for Girls (CT4G) project, specifically highlighting the use of Making through physical and social computing as ways to engage students in CS. A snapshot of one activity from the program is provided-Wearing the Web-in which students use open-hardware programmable badges to explore the underlying structure and technology that enables the Internet. Data from the first year of the CT4G program are presented to show the positive effects that this diverse introduction to CS is having on the students with respect to their attitudes toward CS.

AB Type D flip-flop cell and its scannable version called Muxed-D are the most used sequential components in cell-based synchronous designs because it simplifies timing analysis and it is less susceptible to race problems. However, as technology nodes shrink, it becomes more difficult, especially for high-performance designs, to cope with a hard global timing boundary. The use of latches emerges as a possible solution to the contemporary design challenges such as clock skew/jitter, PVT variation, and low-power and high-performance designs. Moreover, latches are also gaining popularity among asynchronous and timing resilient circuits. One of the available scannable cells for latches is called level sensitivity scan-based design (LSSD). The goal of this brief is to present an open design of an optimized single-latch LSSD cell, which has better tradeoffs between propagation delay, power, energy, and silicon area than the original LSSD design, thus reducing the cost for testing latch-based designs.

AB A highly versatile Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) system, nicknamed the ScouseTom, has been developed. The systemallows control over current amplitude, frequency, number of electrodes, injection protocol and data processing. Current is injected using a Keithley 6221 current source, and voltages are recordedwith a 24-bit EEGsystemwithminimumbandwidth of 3.2 kHz. Custom PCBs interface with a PC to control the measurement process, electrode addressing and triggering of external stimuli. The performance of the system was characterised using resistor phantoms to represent human scalp recordings, with an SNR of 77.5 dB, stable across a four hour recording and 20 Hz to 20 kHz. In studies of both haeomorrhage using scalp electrodes, and evoked activity using epicortical electrode mats in rats, it was possible to reconstruct images matching established literature at known areas of onset. Data collected using scalp electrode in humans matched known tissue impedance spectra and was stable over frequency. The experimental procedure is software controlled and is readily adaptable to new paradigms. Where possible, commercial or open-source components were used, to minimise the complexity in reproduction. The hardware designs and software for the system have been released under an open source licence, encouraging contributions and allowing for rapid replication.

AB Background: Due to the complex process of designing and manufacturing new plant tissue culture vessels through conventional means there have been limited efforts to innovate improved designs. Further, development and availability of low cost, energy efficient LEDs of various spectra has made it a promising light source for plant growth in controlled environments. However, direct replacement of conventional lighting sources with LEDs does not address problems with uniformity, spectral control, or the challenges in conducting statistically valid experiments to assess the effects of light. Prototyping using 3D printing and LED based light sources could help overcome these limitations and lead to improved culture systems.
   Results: A modular culture vessel design in which the fluence rate and spectrum of light are independently controlled was designed, prototyped using 3D printing, and evaluated for plant growth. This design is compatible with semi-solid and liquid based culture systems. Observations on morphology, chlorophyll content, and chlorophyll fluorescence based stress parameters from in vitro plants cultured under different light spectra with similar overall fluence rate indicated different responses in Nicotiana tabacum and Artemisia annua plantlets. This experiment validates the utility of 3D printing to design and test functional vessels and demonstrated that optimal light spectra for in vitro plant growth is species-specific.
   Conclusions: 3D printing was successfully used to prototype novel culture vessels with independently controlled variable fluence rate/spectra LED lighting. This system addresses several limitations associated with current lighting systems, providing more uniform lighting and allowing proper replication/randomization for experimental plant biology while increasing energy efficiency. A complete procedure including the design and prototyping of a culture vessel using 3D printing, commercial scale injection molding of the prototype, and conducting a properly replicated experiment are discussed. This open source design has the scope for further improvement and adaptation and demonstrates the power of 3D printing to improve the design of culture systems.

AB Given the recent difficulty in continuing the classic CMOS manufacturing density and power scaling curves, also known as Moore's Law and Dennard Scaling, respectively, we find that modern complex system architectures are increasingly relying upon accelerators in order to optimize the placement of specific computational workloads. In addition, large-scale computing infrastructures utilized in HPC, data intensive computing, and cloud computing must rely almost exclusively upon commodity device architectures provided by third-party manufacturers. The end result being a final system architecture that lacks specificity for the target software workload. At the same time, there is a trend in the FPGA space of much larger FPGAs with a lot more resources and hardened IP blocks, making this type of architecture design space exploration much easier.
   The OpenSoC System Architect infrastructure combines several open source design tools and methodologies into a central infrastructure for designing, developing, and verifying the necessary hardware and software modules required to implement application-specific processors for use in FPGAs. The end result is an infrastructure that permits rapid development and deployment of application-specific accelerators and softcores, including a fully functional software development tool chain.

AB This paper describes the use of various open source hardware such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, etc. to build smart and secure homes. The hardware is open source and hence cost efficient. This home automation system allows the end user to monitor his home or office with a smartphone, tablet, or any computer. This paper also explains the use of the security system for fire hazards that may occur due to a gas leakage and can be detected using a smoke sensor. It uses a low power NRF24L trans-receiver at each node around the house to create a mesh network that connects to a Linux based central hub. Users can monitor the house from anywhere and get periodic alerts. In the proposed work, the house can also be controlled using voice commands such as Google Voice, Apple HomeKit and Alexa.

AB Drowsy driving is the primary cause of motor vehicle accidents and is a risk factor that leads to the loss of human life, remaining as a challenge for the global automotive industry. Recently, drowsy monitoring system has been actively studied for prediction system based machine learning. However, the challenges of automotive real-time constraints and flexibility should be taken into consideration against a large amount of heterogeneous data from vehicle network and other device. To solve this problem, we propose drowsy monitoring system based machine learning using GS1 standard. First, vehicle motion data is defined and modeled using the GS1 standard language for drowsy predict. Second, we propose an optimal algorithm selection and detail architecture for automotive real-time environments through machine learning algorithms (KNN, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression) and deep learning algorithms (RNN-LSTM). Finally, we describe system-wide integration and implementation through the open source hardware Raspberry Pi and the machine learning SW framework We provide optimal LSTM architecture and implementation that takes into account the real-time environmental conditions and how to improve the readability and usability of the vehicle motion data. We also share the rapid prototyping methodology case of connected car systems without other sensor devices.

AB There are several specific solutions for accessing sensors and actuators present in any process or system through a TCP/IP network, either local or a wide area type like the Internet. The usage of sensors and actuators of different nature and diverse interfaces (SPI, I2C, analogue, etc.) makes access to them from a network in a homogeneous and secure way more complex. A framework, including both software and hardware resources, is necessary to simplify and unify networked access to these devices. In this paper, a set of open-source software tools, specifically designed to cover the different issues concerning the access to sensors and actuators, and two proposed low-cost hardware architectures to operate with the abovementioned software tools are presented. They allow integrated and easy access to local or remote sensors and actuators. The software tools, integrated in the free authoring tool Easy Java and Javascript Simulations (EJS) solve the interaction issues between the subsystem that integrates sensors and actuators into the network, called convergence subsystem in this paper, and the Human Machine Interface (HMI)-this one designed using the intuitive graphical system of EJS-located on the user's computer. The proposed hardware architectures and software tools are described and experimental implementations with the proposed tools are presented.

AB This paper draws on a strategy-as-practice perspective to examine the articulation of agenda setting, a key activity important for both strategy meetings and open strategy. Our research target is the 9th National Science and Technology Conference held by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan in 2012. The conference is nationwide, regularly organized, and has an open design, highlighting the importance of setting agendas skillfully to build consensus and guide action. Using qualitative-based action research procedures, we develop three strategy tools for the design and delivery of agenda setting. These include problematizing, futurizing, and corresponding. We also point out moralizing as a moderator for such a strategic and creative process. We conclude by discussing the implications of our research for strategy workshops, strategy practices, and open strategy.

AB How can STS researchers collaborate with communities to design environmental monitoring devices that more effectively express their experiences and address gaps in regulation? This paper describes and shows the results of a novel method of visualizing environmental emissions of corrosive gases such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S) exposure using photographic paper. H2S is a neurotoxic and flammable gas that smells like rotten eggs and is frequently associated with oil and natural gas extraction. Communities living with oil and gas development in Wyoming report odors of rotten eggs and describe symptoms of H2S exposure. H2S is recognized as an acute and chronic threat to human and environmental health and oil and gas companies are required to have plans in place to prevent and respond to accidental, high concentration releases of H2S. They are not, however, required to monitor, report or prevent routine daily emissions. Yet 15-25% of the oil and gas wells in the US are predicted to contain H2S, and some communities surrounded by multiple wells report chronic, routine exposure. Chronic exposure is difficult to represent with current tools for monitoring H2S because they are designed to measure acute workplace exposure. Informed by STS theories of black boxes and regimes of imperceptibility that focus on the need to revise not only regulations but also material tools of science, this paper describes the development of an indexical approach to visualizing this hazard. In indexical design, the reactive sensing element of a scientific instrument is brought to the foreground. The silver in the photopaper is an index as it tarnishes with H2S exposure. Discolored tests strips can be arranged together to form data-rich maps of the exposure landscape where this discoloration both represents how the gas spreads through a space and is a physical trace of the gas. Preliminary results in the form of data-rich maps show that regulating H2S emissions as primarily accidental is inappropriate and fails to adequately protect human health.

DE open design; sustainable design; social design; products
ID PERSPECTIVE
AB Open design is commonly seen to derive from the power of the Internet and its associated technologies to distribute the means of producing and reproducing data and content of all kinds - including product designs. Open design connects the generation and transmission of digital content to actual material production and physical embodiment - the making of tangible things. Open design therefore represents an opening-up of the means of production of our material culture - how we make things. This chapter considers products in the open design context more broadly, in relation to considerations of sustainability and practices of social and sustainable design. It takes a broad view of the term 'product'. Object-based designing is not necessarily the optimal way of addressing the 'wicked' problems we face as manifestations of the inherent unsustainability of our existing systems of production and consumption, and our current lifestyles and value systems. The open design context can be seen to extend beyond the current model of the creation of products via an expanded circle of participation, to include the expanded field of design represented by service design and social innovation. This chapter, therefore, considers not simply products in the open design context (in the form of new modes of doing product design) but also products of the open design context. It uses an expanded idea of product which includes any form of designed outcome, physical or non-physical, and an expanded idea of openness which goes beyond the internet- and digitally-enabled production of physical objects.

DE Personalisation; User-completion; Craft; Mass customisation; Products
AB The Internet is facilitating new ways of designing, manufacturing and distributing products. This has led to a more democratic, open-design approach and has resulted in users having more involvement in the design process than ever before. In particular, designers are shifting away from designing a finished product, to either designing components, a template or a set of tools which the user interacts with to finalise and/or personalise the product. This way of approaching design is still in its infancy. The authors' have termed this design framework, as it applies within product design, 'user-completion'.
   The authors' propose that the user-completion framework operates at the intersection between mass-customisation and craft. The skills and knowledge sets associated with mass-customisation and craft, presents challenges and opportunities for both the designer and user. The user-completion framework enables users to personalise the end product and therefore requires designers to shift their conceptual approach, by handing-over more design control to the users. It is hoped that by doing so, and by engaging the user in the product's completion, a stronger emotional bond will be generated between the user and the final product. This design process also anticipates an added value and a longer life cycle for the product.
   The 'user-completion' framework proposed by the authors will be outlined, and supported with the three case study examples of work. Through these case studies the value of users being involved in the design process is explored, as is their engagement with craft and their perceived emotional value of the resulting products.

AB This paper presents a novel method of automating experimental measurements in a laboratory environment. The acquisition and analysis of experimental data is possible using electronic sensors, open source software and hardware environment that makes the whole process simpler. This paper presents an experimental environment of testing of a centrifugal pump. However, the same approach can be extended to similar experiments that involve measurement of various parameters. In this experiment pressures, flow rate and speed that are essential parameters in a typical pump testing is measured using sensors and interfaced with the open source hardware Arduino. The advantage of using this approach is easy readability, more accurate and time saving. Different sensors that are used and calibration procedures involved are explained. The instrument chain consisting of sensors, Arduino and personal computer needed for the analysis of acquired data is explained.

ID MEMRISTOR; MODEL
AB Neuromemristive systems (NMSs) are brain inspired, adaptive computer architectures based on emerging resistive memory technology (memristors). NMSs adopt a mixed-signal design approach with closely coupled memory and processing, resulting in high area and energy efficiencies. Existing work suggests that NMSs could even supplant conventional architectures in niche application domains. However, given the infancy of the field, there are still a number open design questions, particularly in the area of circuit realization, that must be explored in order for the research to move forward. This chapter reviews a number of theoretical and practical concepts related to NMS circuit design, with particular focus on neuron, synapse, and plasticity circuits.

AB Robotics is one of the major disruptive technologies of our time, and offers significant opportunities for innovation and competitiveness in the global marketplace. However, in resource-poor countries like India, engineering education is hampered by a lack of access to affordable and innovative hands-on practical education modules for the laboratory. This is especially the case in emerging disciplines like robotics. Moreover, expensive commercial grade robots offer limited scope for experimentation and learning outcomes in an academic setting. This situation can be remedied with the increasing affordability and versatility of open source hardware like microcontrollers and microcomputers, commercial off-the-shelf components like motors, actuators, sensors and power transmission mechanisms, as well as free, open source software. In this paper, a low-cost build your own (BYO) three-link electrically actuated robot manipulator is designed and developed for adoption in robotics and mechatronics laboratory courses. It can be disseminated and adapted on a wide scale at affordable cost for hands-on manufacturing education.

AB This paper describes an open source analogue to digital converter designed to meet the requirements of power system waveform measurement. In particular, attention is given to ensuring that waveforms are synchronously sampled to maintain the relationship between the various observed quantities, and the system is synchronized to the UTC time base by means of a GPS receiver, making a wide area comparison of data and synchrophasor estimation possible. This ADC can be used as a front end in Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) devices, amongst other applications.
   An advantage of this method is that the sampling clock is disciplined to the UTC time base to ensure an integer number of samples are taken per second at the desired sampling rate. The certainty of the timing of the sample data makes a wide area comparison of the data possible, providing an enabling technology for Waveform Measurement Units (WMU).
   An open design philosophy is used throughout, with the intention of providing visibility throughout the operation of the device, so that the end user can study its operation and evaluate and modify it within their application.

AB Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems can consume a large percentage of the energy used in a typical building. Intelligent building automation systems (BAS) are widely deployed to enable more efficient HVAC utilization, thus reducing the energy consumed. Enhanced data requires distributed sensing. We propose an instrumentation system for a low-cost, over-the-top efficiency monitor using the open-source hardware design to enable rapid deployment and live monitoring of temperature within zones such as rooms. This enables evaluation of HVAC system efficiency, and building parameter monitoring in that room. This paper presents our HVAC, thermal, and building parameter monitoring system design and considerations using an open-source hardware approach for fast customizations. We show results of monitoring two buildings including distributed sensing within rooms, and discuss intelligence gathered through use of this system as a precursor towards a fully automated efficiency evaluation and measurement.

AB Soil and nutrient depletion from intensive use of land is a critical issue for food production. An understanding of whether the soil is adequately treated with appropriate crop management practices in real-time during production cycles could prevent soil erosion and the overuse of natural or artificial resources to keep the soil healthy and suitable for planting. Precision agriculture traditionally uses expensive techniques to monitor the health of soil and crops including images from satellites and airplanes. Recently there are several studies using drones and a multitude of sensors connected to farm machinery to observe and measure the health of soil and crops during planting and harvesting. This paper describes a real-time, in-situ agricultural internet of things (IoT) device designed to monitor the state of the soil and the environment. This device was designed to be compatible with open hardware and it is composed of temperature and humidity sensors (soil and environment), electrical conductivity of the soil and luminosity, Global Positioning System (GPS) and a ZigBee radio for data communication. The field trial involved soil testing and measurements of the local climate in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The measurements of soil temperature, humidity and conductivity are used to monitor soil conditions. The local climate data could be used to support decisions about irrigation and other activities related to crop health. On-going research includes methods to reduce the consumption of energy and increase the number of sensors. Future applications include the use of the IoT device to detect fire in crops, a common problem in sugar cane crops and the integration of the IoT device with irrigation management systems to improve water usage.

AB Distributed manufacturing, where decentralized small, local sites are engaged in production, often supported by digital systems and networks, can be a powerful tool in humanitarian aid. Field Ready uses distributed manufacturing to produce essential non-food items locally where they are needed during humanitarian responses. Such supplies can be available to communities in need and to relief workers more quickly, more cheaply than alternatives, and provide appropriate solutions to problems, often engaging local people in designing and making necessary items, and supporting economic development. Scaling up this requires local production capabilities (skills, tools, and information such as designs), which can be boosted by adoption of these methods by aid agencies, international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) and others. Local manufacturing offers the potential for disaster affected communities to be engaged in recovery, and long term to become more resilient, with access to all the equipment and information required to make the supplies they need. However, there are challenges: appropriate quality control for distributed manufacture, unlocking the potential for in-region manufacturers to engage in humanitarian response, and uptake of digital knowledge sharing and collaboration to the humanitarian sector. In this paper, we share experiences of human-centred design and global collaboration to solve local problems, of manufacturing in remote and challenging locations, community building and bridging sectors through the Humanitarian Makers network, and new ideas for distributed manufacturing standards and quality.

AB This paper designs and implements a smart garden system that can be used inside the house. To do this, we used particle filter and environmental sensors, which are open hardware controllers, and designed to control and observe automatic water supply, lighting, and growth monitoring with three wireless systems (Bluetooth, Ethernet, Wi-Fi). This system has been developed to make it possible to use it in an indoor space such as an apartment, rather than a large-scale cultivation system such as a conventional plant factory which has already been widely used. The developed system collects environmental data by using soil sensor, illuminance sensor, humidity sensor and temperature sensor as well as control through smartphone app, analyzes the collected data, and controls water pump, LED lamp, air ventilation fan and so on. As a wireless remote control method, we implemented Bluetooth, Ethernet and Wi-Fi. Finally, it is designed for users to enable remote control and monitoring when the user is not in the house.

AB This paper proposes a design and fabrication approach based on the conceptualization of architectural formations as spatial assemblies of discrete building blocks to be aggregated through custom robotic procedures. Such strategy attempts to create synergies between different technological methods and to define a new and open design space where discrete design, serial prototyping and robotic assembly can be exploited to create complex reconfigurable structures. With the aim to allow users to explore the field of discrete geometries for architectural application without need for prior programming knowledge, we developed a software framework for representing and designing with discrete elements, different digital fabrication techniques integrated with conventional production processes for serial prototyping of repetitive units, and custom robotic fabrication routines, allowing a direct translation from aggregated geometry to assembly toolpath. Together these methods aim at creating a more direct connection between design and fabrication, relying on the idea of discrete elements assembly and on the parallel between modular design and modularized robot code generation.

AB The Open Source Applications for Industrial Automation (OpenIn) project is a three year duration Project funded by the European Union Erasmus+ Strategic Partnerships Programme, started in October, 2016 and it involves 4 partners across Europe. The development of professional automated industrial systems nowadays is still a "proprietary technology" at high costs, which in a way impedes its development and makes its implementation complicated. This project aims at helping higher VET and HEIs institutions, Technical Universities as well as enterprises using automation systems (especially SMEs) to cut costs and embrace innovation by providing them with Training Courses for both students and teachers on free open source hardware and software for designing automated systems. The OpenIn course of students in Industrial Automation using Open Source Applications - it will be a Training course for EQF level 5+ students in the field of Industrial Automation and concerning the following topics: a) Industrial Sensors, b) Industrial Communication-will be described.

AB The demand of the industry for high performance electric motors has significantly increased nowadays. This has boosted the usage of permanent magnet brushless synchronous motors (BLSM) in many applications where the accuracy and performance requirements are high. Further improvement of the BLSM drive systems performance can be achieved by providing them with adaptive control capabilities. The relative complexity of adaptive control schemes and algorithms and the computational load that they impose have prevented until recently their practical implementation into the industrial servo systems. In this investigation, a neuro-adaptive control scheme where the rule for parameter adaptation is designed by taking into account the variable structure control (VSC) concepts and Lyapunov stability, is proposed and embedded into an inexpensive, available on the market, position control system for brushless synchronous servomotors. The experimental tests have been carried on using compact and flexible, based on open hardware and software concept, dual-axis motion controllers PMC201/PMC202 manufactured by the PicoMotion Inc. The applied software has been written using the Motion Control Framework software platform, provided together with the above controllers. The results obtained with the proposed neuro-adaptive control scheme have been compared to those obtained using the originally built into the system PI controller. The experiments have shown that the implemented advanced adaptive control approach is practically viable and can be embedded into the industrial motion control systems which will lead to their improved performance.

AB In the last few years, a demand for renewed product personalisation to satisfy the exact need of the customers has been observed in some markets. As opposed to customisation, which put emphasis on the satisfaction of explicit needs of a defined market segment, individualisation aims at satisfying the specific needs of a customer. Product design for Mass Individualisation (MI) is a new product design paradigm that comprises an open hardware platform and multiple modules that are integrated with the platform, as per end-users' choice. This paper identifies key areas and components which need to be focused to realise this approach and convert it into an industrial practice by an explorative study of existing product design and customisation approaches. A questionnaire survey has been conducted and results are presented for the industrial implication and insights on this approach. The findings clearly show that MI provides most individualised and technologically advanced product.

AB This paper deals with e-learning design and development training courses, more precisely with remote training by practical activities of laboratory experiments (E-Lab). Indeed. the majority of remote training platforms offer theoretical courses and a few practical activities. which are essential in training theoretical Science and Technology. In order to share the costly equipment, in this work, we propose an open hardware/software architecture allowing remote access to a laboratory equipment by designing in Matlab two graphical interfaces using Internet/Intranet network and TCP/IP communication protocol. A real-time control and supervision is performed to carry out all the practical activity according to a pedagogical scenario elaborated by the trainer. The use of these interfaces is illustrated by educational sessions articulated on the Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) regulation and the Generalized Predictive Control (GPC) of temperature control system. The challenge of elaborating a remote practical activity with pedagogical effectiveness is accomplished in the above proposed solution. All the hardware and software that made available the remote experimentation platform give possibility to achieve others traditional activities in experimentation laboratory.

AB Pain, one of the most urgent of all senses, is almost constant in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Several means of pain assessment have been described and are being used in all NICUs, however there is no means of detection and signal the caregiver that a neonatal patient is in pain.
   Therefore, using an open-source hardware and NICU's most frequent patient monitoring device (the pulseoximeter) we created a cheap technological system of vital signs data acquisition and caregiver signaling in the event of pain in patient in the NICU.

The main goal of the demonstrator is to show the features and benefits of a fault-injection tool for FPGAs called FIJI (Fault Injection Instrumenter) that was developed by the authors of this paper. Besides, the demonstrator should illustrate typical sources of hardware/software faults as well as approaches and methods for fault-tolerant design that are commonly applied to modern electronic based systems. Both details of the demonstrator's design as well as implementation results including the overhead on resources caused by the proposed fault-injection logic are presented. The demonstrator is portable to FPGA families of different FPGA vendors and can be implemented by using freeware/open-source design tools. Finally, it is planned that all design data of the demonstrator (including source code and documentation) will be available under an open-source license.

AB This paper presents the Pi-puck extension board - an interface between the e-puck robot platform and a Raspberry Pi single-board computer that enhances the processing power, memory capacity, and networking capabilities of the robot at a low cost. It allows high-level control algorithms, wireless communication, and computationally expensive operations such as real-time image processing to be handled by a Raspberry Pi, while the e-puck's microcontroller deals with low-level motor control and sensor interfacing.
   Although two similar extension boards for the e-puck robot platform already exist, they are now out-dated and expensive in comparison. Our open-source hardware design and supporting software infrastructure offer an inexpensive upgrade to the e-puck robot, transforming it into the Pi-puck - a modern and flexible new platform for mobile robotics research.

AB This paper reflects on the dynamics and practices of building a maker community around a new hardware platform. We examine the factors promoting the successful uptake of a maker platform from two perspectives: first, we investigate the technical and user experience considerations that users identify as the most important. Second, we explore the specific activities that help attract a community and encourage sustained participation. We present an inductive approach based on the case study of Bela, an embedded platform for creating interactive audio systems. The technical design and community building processes are detailed, culminating in a successful crowdfunding campaign. To further understand the community dynamics, the paper also presents an intensive three-day workshop with eight digital musical instrument designers. From observations and interviews, we reflect on the relationship between the platform and the community and offer suggestions for HCI researchers and practitioners interested in establishing their own maker communities.

AB Because of the rapid development of EtherCAT as the standard fieldbus in control and automation and the increasing demands of low cost portable main controllers, we aim to assess the performance of an EtherCAT network in handling real-time demands using open source EtherCAT master protocol on open hardware platforms. In comparison to that of commercial products, the performance of open platforms is still indefinite and may depend on different indicators such as the kernel version, real-time architecture, and the protocol of EtherCAT. This paper provides implementation guidelines and procedures to develop the embedded platforms-a task which is difficult due to lack of systematic documents and technical support. The real-time evaluation of an open source EtherCAT master with a dual-kernel approach of real-time embedded Linux, Xenomai, is performed to validate that even low-cost open embedded hardware platforms are also capable in performing real-time EtherCAT control applications.

AB Open source hardware projects are becoming more and more common. OpenRISC SOC, one of the prominent of these projects, has become quite popular with the support of volunteer developers. In this work, we have demonstrated the design of an DES (Data Encryption Standard) based system, that can be used in security applications, on ORPSoC-v2 (Openrisc Reference Platform System-on-Chip). Additionally, we have showed that the system works successfully with a sample C application on an FPGA. This work emphasizes design security and flexibility features of open source systems against alternative closed source solutions. Another purpose of this study is to establish a platform for future studies on the analysis of side channel attacks.

AB This paper presents a novel approach to protect Openflow switches against a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Openflow switches are the core of Software Defined Networks (SDN) and they are very flexible, programmable, and can be used for several functionalities within a network. As the control algorithm of the switch is implemented on a separate computer (Controller), this software can be implemented on any part of the network packet including Layers 2, 3, and 4 headers. Therefore, an Openflow switch can work as a conventional switch, a router or a firewall. The open design of Openflow makes it vulnerable to several types of DoS attacks. One of those attacks is to overwhelm the switch flow table with entities larger than its buffer making legitimate packets unable to traverse the switch. The proposed approach depends on a Sandbox like model, where a second switch and controller is implemented and all new packets with no matching rules are forwarded to the Sandbox. The Sandbox clone is monitored and controlled, so a forwarding rule is always created on the Sandbox switch and transferred only to the working switch when it is classified as a normal rule. Otherwise, a cleanup operation is executed periodically on the sandbox switch to remove malicious rules. Rules are classified based on the statistics entries already existing in Openflow switches flow table. The proposed approach is simple and does not need any extra memory or modifications in the switches. It is proven to mitigate this type of DoS attacks.

AB Particulate matter pollution becomes an increasingly important problem in developing countries and poses a hazard to human health especially in indoor environment. At the same time, modern buildings are equipped with advanced sensing and control technologies, offering control and optimisation capabilities over a large range of parameters. This paper proposes an open platform of a WiFi-enabled indoor air quality monitoring and control system, which could be incorporated into such a 'smart building' structure. The complete software and hardware design of this system is presented, along with a series of control experiments. The proposed system operates over an existing WiFi wireless network utilising the MQTT protocol. It is capable of monitoring the indoor air quality as well as controlling an air purifier to regulate the particulate matters concentration. Experiment results under a real world office environment demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design.

AB Tangible learning is a promising branch, especially for scientific learning, allowing an enhanced sensorial involvement and participation by children. While a lot is being done on the side of programming, less has been investigated on elementary spatial and geometric concepts. The paper presents i-Vertex, an open -hardware framework for tangible serious games on geometry concepts for primary school pupils. The framework targets spatial reasoning and includes music as a related and complementary feature, which should add value also for usability. i-Vertex supports collaboration between kids and the key role of a teacher as an adult that interacts with the children in different ways, introducing them to the discovery and understanding of basic geometric concepts and physical phenomenon. At present, we have built a prototype, featuring a very limited number of vertices, and functionally tested it in lab, in two main scenarios covering topics such as lines and triangles. Based on the successful feedback of this experiment, we intend to proceed further, upgrading the platform with a more powerful and product oriented micro-controller and board.

AB This paper introduces a newly developed Object Oriented Open Software Architecture designed for supporting security applications, while leveraging on the capabilities offered by dedicated Open Hardware devices. Specifically, we target the the SEcubeTM platform, an Open Hardware security platform based on a 3D SiP (System on Package) designed and produced by Blu5 Group. The platform integrates three components employed for security in a single package: a Cortex-M4 CPU, a FPGA and an EAL5+ certified Smart Card. The Open Software Architecture targets both the host machine and the security device, together with the secure communication among them. To maximize its usability, this architecture is organized in several abstraction layers, ranging from hardware interfaces to device drivers, from security APIs to advanced applications, like secure messaging and data protection. We aim at releasing a multi-platform Open Source security framework, where software and hardware cooperate to hide to both the developer and the final users classical security concepts like cryptographic algorithms and keys, focusing, instead, on common operational security concepts like groups and policies.

AB Since the demand for more bandwidth, agile infrastructures and services grows, it becomes challenging for Service Providers like GEANT to manage the proprietary underlay, while keeping costs low. In such a scenario, Software Defined Networking (SDN), open hardware and open source software prove to be key components to address those challenges. After one year of development, SDX-L2 and BoD, the SDN-ization of the GEANT Open and Bandwidth on Demand (BoD) services, have been brought to the pilot status and GEANT is now testing the outcomes on its operational network. In this demonstration, we show BoD and SDX-L2 "going live" at the GEANT production infrastructure. The pilots run on the same underlay infrastructure thanks to the virtualization capabilities of the network devices. Provisioning of the services is covered during the demo. In the final steps of the demonstration, we show how the infrastructure is able to automatically manage network events and how it remains operational in the case of fault events.

AB Currently, more and more organizations are aware of the increasing potential of nanoscience and nanotechnology, due to the wide field of innovative applications they address from biomedical and molecular technology to semiconductor and material sciences. Nanotechnology is an area where fundamental or applicative research is still in progress and where many industrial applications are waited to come. Despite the progress of this field, many institutions, notably educational ones, cannot afford investing in these technologies allowing an access to nanoscale, and a lack of knowledge therefore remains. The Nanoeye project focuses on the widespread of Atomic Force Microscopy or AFM technology, which is the basic access tool to the nanoscale. The main goal is to design an optimal AFM model in terms of manufacturing costs by using rapid prototyping techniques and open-source hardware, and designing it as an educational-oriented equipment. This approach is two-fold: as an AFM-unexperienced user discovering its principle of operation at nanoscale or as a future engineer understanding its multi-disciplinary structure involving mechanics, optics, electronics, software and control sciences. This paper introduces the first functional structure of Nanoeye AFM project, focusing on its mechanical structure. It is submitted to the IFAC2017 special feature Automatic Control Demonstrators.

ID CHIP; NETWORK
AB The chip industry faces two key challenges today the impending end of Moore's Law and the rising costs of chip design and verification (millions of dollars today). Heterogeneous IPs - cores and domain-specific accelerators - are a promising answer to the first challenge, enabling performance and energy benefits no longer provided by technology scaling. IP-reuse with plug-and-play designs can help with the second challenge, amortizing NRE costs tremendously. A key requirement in a heterogeneous IP-based plug-and-play SoC environment is an interconnection fabric to connect these IPs together. This fabric needs to be scalable - low latency, low energy and low area - and yet be flexible/parametrizable for use across designs. The key scalability challenge in any Network-on-Chip (NoC) today is that the latency increases proportional to the number of hops.
   In this work, we present a NoC generator called OpenSMART, which generates low-latency NoCs based on SMART(1). SMART is a recently proposed NoC microarchitecture that enables multi-hop on-chip traversals within a single cycle, removing the dependence of latency on hops. SMART leverages wire delay of the underlying repeated wires, and augments each router with the ability to request and setup bypass paths. OpenSMART takes SMART from a NoC optimization to a design methodology for SoCs, enabling users to generate verified RTL for a class of user-specified network configurations, such as network size, topology, routing algorithm, number of VCs/buffers, router pipeline stages, and so on. OpenSMART also provides the ability to generate any heterogeneous topology with low and high-radix routers and optimized single-stage pipelines, leveraging fast logic delays in technology nodes today. OpenSMART v1.0 comes with both Bluespec System Verilog and Chisel implementations, and this paper also presents a case study of our experiences with both languages. OpenSMART is available for download(2) and is going to be a key addition to the emerging open-source hardware movement, providing a glue for interconnecting existing and emerging IPs.

AB Weather stations are a valuable tool to many different areas, like agriculture, aviation, construction, sports and recreation, specially because they collect weather data, which can be stored and processed to gather specific information to correlate events to the weather action. This work shows a development model of a low cost weather station, using only free hardware and software, connected to the internet, giving real time data taken from the station, as well as history of the stored data. This station, even though using low cost or handcrafted sensors, like those that measure wind speed, wind direction and rainfall index, showed consistent results costing only 10% of the price, in comparison with some professional weather stations, allowing its popularization in agriculture, homes and institutions.

AB Robotics has been used to draw the attention of young students to computing and engineering. Unfortunately, most hardware and software resources used to teach programming and robotics are not adequate for students with visual impairment (VI). For instance, most programming environments for young students are highly visual and the commercial robotics kits were not built for people with VI. This paper describes the main design requirements so that both the proposed robot hardware and the software can also be used by people with VI. The hardware part is the focus of this paper, a robot called Donnie. It consists of open hardware, a design with low-cost and easy to find parts, and a 3D printed structure. Our main contribution is the presentation of a low-cost Arduino-based robot, compatible with Player robotic framework and integrated with sound feedback and text-to-speech.

AB An open hardware framework for approximating range and bearing of radio frequency (RF) sensors is presented. The current work has an immediate application in solving the simultaneous localization and mapping problem which is one of the challenging problems in the field of robotics. In this work, a set of RF sensors utilizing the ZigBee protocol are placed in an indoor environment and a base RF sensor is mounted within a rotating parabolic reflector on a mobile robot. The proposed range and bearing approximation framework works in two cascaded phases. In the first phase, the base RF sensor sends an RF signal to all other RF sensors within its operating range. These RF sensors then respond to the base RF module where ZigBee packets are parsed to store raw data for approximating range. In the second phase, a stepper motor is employed to rotate the parabolic reflector and the base RF sensor mounted on the robot. These two phases continue until a full revolution of 360 degrees has been achieved. The data is processed for approximating the bearing of each RF sensor with respect to the mobile robot's heading angle, as well as the distance (range) to the RF sensor at its associated bearing. The proposed hardware setup is validated through a set of experimental results gathered in an indoor environment.

AB Open Source Hardware allows users to share, customize, and improve designs, thus enabling technological advancement through communities of practice. We propose open source hardware for educational haptics that permits researchers, educators, and students to share designs arising from their different perspectives, with the potential to expand educational applications. In this paper we present a family of open source kinesthetic haptic devices that build upon the design of a previous educational haptic device, Hapkit 3.0. First, we discuss methods for Hapkit personalization and customization that can be achieved by K-12 students and educators. Next, we describe two kinesthetic haptic device designs that evolved from the original Hapkit 3.0. One uses two standard Hapkits with additional components to form a Pantograph mechanism, and the other uses customized Hapkit elements along with a novel kinematic design to form a serial mechanism. These designs are modular; after building two Hapkits, a user acquires a small number of additional parts to transform them into a two-degree-of-freedom device. The Pantograph mechanism was used in an undergraduate class to teach robotics and haptics to both engineering and non-engineering students. Open source designs for all devices as well as tutorials for customization are available at http://hapkit.stanford.edu.

AB An efficient practical method for bipolar transistor application for neutron fluence registration is presented. The method is focused on neutron fluences damage effect correlation for various sources to reference source. The bipolar transistor connection diagram and an example of device realization based on STM32 microcontroller are described. STM32 is used for providing test signals and parameter registration used for gain factor calculation of bipolar transistors monitor (BTM). The proposed approach allows considering the features of pre-irradiated at reference source BTM and their application as the neutron fluence monitors. These connection diagram and constructive solutions provide "on-line" neutron fluence registration for different sources in terms of reference source as required for radiation tests results verification.

AB Mixed-reality environments allow to combine tangible interaction with digital feedback, empowering interaction designers to take benefits from both real and virtual worlds. This interaction paradigm is also being applied in classrooms for learning purposes. However, most of the times the devices supporting mixed-reality interaction are neither portable nor affordable, which could be a limitation in the learning context. In this paper we propose CETA, a mixed-reality environment using low-cost Android tablets which tackles portability and costs issues. In addition, CETA is open-source, reproducible and extensible.

AB Although there are a large number of autonomous robot platforms for ground contact and flying robots, this has not been the case for underwater robotic platforms. This is not due to the lack of interesting applications in the shallow underwater domain (50m depth), but rather due to the relative cost of building such platforms. This has recently changed with the development of inexpensive thrusters and other underwater components. Leveraging these components and design principles learned from more expensive remotely operated vehicles this paper describes Milton, an inexpensive open hardware design for a traditional thruster-based underwater robot. Utilizing commercial off-the-shelf hardware and a ROS infrastructure, Milton, and Milton-inspired designs provide an inexpensive platform for autonomous underwater vehicle research.

AB In current automotive applications, novel and robust communication technologies have been used to optimize some features related to security, fuel consumption and user interface. However, the automotive communication protocols present two problems: 1. the connections between devices are very complex and their maintenance is difficult, and 2. most of the commercial devices, specialized to send data between devices, use proprietary software to perform operations inside the vehicle. In this work, a novel embedded platform was designed to measure and control the speed and torque of electric motors of a 200 kW electric vehide. It is a versatile, modular and open source design, which exchanges data with each motor using the CAN Bus protocol to control their speed. Also, the implementation and maintenance of the proposed platform becomes simpler. The proposed platform was built and tested with the devices that are used inside the car.

AB The concept of quality of life is used as a measure of the welfare of a society, highlighting the relationship between the environment and health, mainly associated with pollution. Hence the importance of monitoring and communicating its results, in a timely manner, to the community. But often the last part of the process fail, there is a lack of communication between data, information and community. Using open hardware and open source tools, and based on the Internet of things concept, a low-cost citizen monitoring network, that cost less than US $150 was implemented. This network measures Carbon Monoxide (CO), Temperature, Relative Humidity, Particulate Matter 2.5, Noise and UV radiation, with a reading frequency of every 40 s and a hibernation period of 15 min. The environmental monitoring network gather information from the environment, through sensors, and then store it in a MySQL database, to finally be deployed in a web site hosted on a local web server Apache, implemented ex professo. In effect, the system is able to deliver geotagged information and the state of environmental pollution to the citizens.

AB The primary objective of the paper is to construct and test a low-cost, minimally supervised gesture recognition system which identifies static gestures efficiently and accurately. The proposed system uses ADXL335 accelerometer sensors which track the gestures and these sensors are interfaced with an Arduino ATMega 2560 micro-controller for data processing and gesture recognition. The software of the system implemented in the micro-controller, features a computationally feasible algorithm which requires only nominal resources to recognize the gestures. The paper further elucidates on minimizing the number of accelerometers to reduce the cost and power-consumption of the system. The performance of the system is assessed using static gestures in the alphabets of the American Sign Language (ASL) across data-sets obtained from 3 trained ASL signers. The average run-time efficiency of the proposed system with a maximum and minimum configuration of 5 and 2 accelerometers was found to be 95.3% and 87.0%, with the cost of these prototype systems being realized at 20 USD and 12.5 USD respectively. It was also found that the system can be trained for the static gestures of the alphabets in ASL under two minutes by a new-user with any system configuration. The authors also feel that the system is compatible with other IoT platforms for interoperability.

DE Air dehumidifier; Water scarcity-shortage-crisis; Embedded system;
   Peltier; Open-hardware; Internet of Things (IoT) application
AB Currently, the water crisis is not only visible in Brazil but almost everywhere and it arises where water scarcity becomes a global challenge or environmental concerns about the shortage of drinking water. The need to have water available for consumption is critical, since, in turn, it is the main source for life on Earth. Despite all of Earth's water found, only 2.5% of it is freshwater. From this smallest part, 70% of it is used in agriculture, 23% by industries and 7% for human consumption. This paper presents an embedded system prototype for air dehumidifying which has the main purpose of obtaining water (by means of condensation). Others benefits include low cost, low size, portability and an Internet of Things application approach. The dehumidifier uses an aluminum plate around 36 cm(2) and about 0.5 mm thickness, a thermoelectric Peltier tablet, a breadboard UNO R3 arduino, wires jumper, transistors TIP122 and 1 K Omega (Ohm) resistors. Within the initial results, we verified the condensed water in the aluminum and the formation of water repeatedly and controlled.

AB The abundance of activity trackers and biosignal sensors as well as the evolution of IoT and communication technologies have considerably advanced the concept of Quantified-Self. Nowadays there are several frameworks and applications that realize the concept, focusing though strictly on specific areas, from daily use to professional activities such as sport and healthcare. This work proposes a versatile, cross-domain solution for building quantified-self applications exploiting the capacities for open-design, modularity and extensibility of the AGILE IoT gateway.

AB In this paper, we present a low-cost approach to upgrade an outdated PUMA (Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly) 560 robot in order to widen the number and type of possible hands-on experiments in control and instrumentation education. Another aim of the upgrade is to enable its future connection to a remote laboratory. We propose a scalable structure to control and monitoring PUMA560 motors. This approach combines several different technologies: A Raspberry Pi for control and monitoring, Python to control the system and chart data, as well as converters and drivers with serial I2C bus interface connectivity to read/write data from/to Puma560 robot. The ideas here explained could be applicable to other physical systems with similar characteristics and number of variables.

AB This paper presents the results of the development of a modular open source platform for experimental control setups. This platform emerged from research on the automatic rotation start-up and landing of a tethered airplane for wind energy harvesting, implementing and testing promising theoretical concepts such as real-time moving horizon estimation (MHE) and non-linear model predictive control (NMPC) on hardware developed in parallel. As experimental setups for testing new control algorithms tend to be fine-tuned by trial and error methods, a rapid control prototyping system for fast evaluation had to be implemented. Technical results of this research are presented in the form of a modular platform for real-time control.
   The created platform provides a complete toolchain for performing, observing and evaluating control experiments. It offers modular low-cost hardware and free software especially suited for flight control experiments. Clearly defined interfaces between the components allow for expanding on its current capabilities for other control scenarios in need of fast and reliable real-time control. The provided modularity allows for spatial separation of high performance computing hardware from low-level components, permits rapid reconfiguration of the experiment and eases the collaboration and workflow between hardware developers and control engineers.

AB Enabled by modern languages and retargetable compilers, software development is in a virtual "Cambrian explosion" driven by a critical mass of powerfully parameterized libraries; but hardware development practices lag far behind. We hypothesize that existing hardware construction languages (HCLs) and novel hardware compiler frameworks (HCFs) can put hardware development on a similar evolutionary path by enabling new hardware libraries to be independent of underlying process technologies including FPGA mappings. We support this claim by (1) evaluating the degree with which Chisel, an existing HCL, can support powerfully parameterized libraries, and (2) introducing the concept and implementation of an HCF that uses an open-source hardware intermediate representation, FIRRTL (Flexible Intermediate Representation for RTL), to transform target-independent RTL into technology-specific RTL. Finally, we evaluate many hardware compiler transformations, including simplifying transformations, analyses, optimizations, instrumentations, and specializations, which demonstrate the power of a combined HCL and HCF approach.

DE digital social innovation; open design; toolkit; P2P mentoring
AB Built upon the definition of social innovation, the umbrella expression "digital social innovation" was introduced to describe a wide range of projects that use digital technologies, community engagement and collaboration, co-creation strategies and bottom-up approaches to solve societal needs, in opposition to the centralized proprietary solutions owned by a few companies. Assessing how digital social innovation projects can scale in order to have a better impact, is crucial to provide a concrete European model to innovation creation that considers values beyond economic factors. This paper presents the results of a one-year training program aimed at supporting the scalability of digital social innovation projects in order to have a better impact. In particular, it describes the application of an open design approach to the design of a P2P mentoring model, and a sustainability toolkit that faces the issue of generating capacity building in emerging community of tech social innovators.

AB Design Education is changing. Setting out from the awareness that "the profile of design professions need not - and should not - remain what it is today" (Findeli, 2001, p. 17) and from insight suggesting that the "experimental approach will become the " normal" approach in our future" (Manzini, 2015, p. 54), the authors worked on an articulated programme of collective open design activities reflecting these changes. The activities focus on concrete experimentation on the paradigm of distributed production, which modifies the articulation of known roles and the traditional design education approaches. Therefore, the initiative aims at involving important international design schools in a concrete design exploration of this key issue for society and the design discipline itself. Manzini (2015) urged to " look at the whole of society as a huge laboratory of sociotechnical experimentation": this practice is a remarkable example which may be used as a model in the future on a larger scale.

ID INNOVATION
AB Openness is a common feature in the contemporary design field. It may be found in both production and design processes, and enables the ability to spread information, create networks and connect people, skills or companies. In the last few year many new web platforms have based their business model on crowdsourcing, networking and on collective intelligence, envisioning new relations between the customer, the designer and the production system. Today not all of them are still on the market, and others have taken new directions. This paper presents a comparison of the path of three design companies: Opendesk, Quirky and Formabilio. The first company is still flourishing, the second changed its intent in part and the third closed after three years of activity. All these platforms have some points in common: they are design companies, they produce objects, their work is based on using internet and they create networks. The paper seeks to analyze these similarities, as well as the differences between these companies, by focusing the role of design, the methods of production and distribution, and the degree of openness in each of them.

AB The development and adoption of digital technologies in the past decades has modified existing working conditions and introduced new ones in many fields and disciplines. This process has also influenced the field of Design especially with the Open Design and the Maker movements. The article proposes a software library for analysing networks of social interactions over time on Git projects hosted on GitHub. Such software may be useful for understanding social interactions over time on GitHub, enabling thus an overview of participation in collaborative processes and therefore advance our understanding of how platforms connects and influence makers and designers in their collaborative work on Open Design. The article show its application to three cases of (a) discussing the nature and concepts of Open Design, (b) teaching Open Design to interaction design students, (c) the development of a platform for Maker laboratories and Open Design projects.

AB Online platforms (i.e. Instructables) often provide design solutions developed locally for one specific person's needs. The goal of the research is to understand how existing specific projects, created to be for one person, can be translated into open design solutions that facilitate spontaneous re-appropriation in a variety of new contexts. By observing and interviewing 36 teams of students within a living lab project where occupational therapists and designers co-design personal assistive devices with and for disabled clients, we explored how the relevant design information can be meaningfully reorganized to create open design. We focused on the designers' choices of concrete attributes with a high impact on the end-result. We suggest a model wherein these attributes are listed and categorized as: Undefined, Defined-Fixed, Contextual, balancing openness and over-design. The research led to a new definition that distinguishes "Open-ended Design" from "Open Design".

AB This paper explores the concept of the circular economy within the context of fashion and textile design in the UK, and does so from the textile and fashion perspectives to explore how this might be achieved. Within the UK alone, we dispose of approximately 10,000 garments every ten minutes (Kerr & Foster, 2011). This project focuses specifically on the practice of textile and fashion design in the UK to consider a more holistic approach for designing and manufacturing within these sectors. Our research aims are to explore the contribution open design can make in implementing the circular economy and thus a more sustainable material future. We ask what are the new models and systems of production that will support a circular economy in textiles? In this work we propose a vision for circular economic models of production in fashion and textiles that adopt open design approaches.

ID OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE
AB Following the successful adoption of the open source model in the software realm, open source is becoming a new design paradigm in hardware development. Open source models for tangible products are still in its infancy, and many studies are required to demonstrate its application to for-profit product development. It is an alluring question why entrepreneurs decide to use an open model to develop their products under risks and unknowns, such as infringement and community management. The goal of this paper is to investigate the motivations of entrepreneurs of open source hardware companies. The leaders and founders of twenty-three companies were interviewed to understand their motivation and experiences in creating a company based on open source hardware. Based on these interviews, we generated a hierarchical framework to explain these motivations, where each level of the framework has been defined, explained and illustrated with representative quotes. The motivations of open source action are framed by two categories in the paper: 1) Intrinsic Motivation, which describes the motivations of an entrepreneur as an individual, who needs personal satisfaction, enjoyment as well as altruism and reciprocity; 2) Extrinsic Motivation, which describes motivations of an entrepreneur whose identity is as a for-profit company leader.

AB The objective of this study is to identify potential consequences for design of the increased prevalence of obesity in children in the US. Data on stature and mass of children in the US have been collected since the 1960s. These data confirm an increased prevalence of obesity, particularly since the early 2000s. Many design tools and standards that inform the design process for this market are based on data collected in the 1970s. The design implications of these changes are examined in the context of a case study on vehicle safety (i.e., "booster") seats. This study concludes that trends of increased prevalence of obesity in children can lead to higher than expected rates of disaccommodation on measures of breadth in some situations.

ID INSTRUCTION; STUDENTS; ONLINE
AB Teaching to Learn (TeatoL) is a flat learning environment where peer-to-peer information exchange has been demonstrated to bridge student learning gaps. Within TeatoL, we integrate and expand peer-to-peer knowledge exchange facilitated by technology, in order to enhance the learning of engineering graduates, using an open-ended authentic life problem in design for manufacturing. One of the main objectives for developing TeatoL was to improve the interest and efficacy of underrepresented minority (URM) students in online engineering courses. In this paper, we present our TeatoL implementation at Tuskegee University (TU), to assess the effectiveness of TeatoL in improving student learning and in enhancing ill-structured problem solving skills of URM students. The participants in the learning environment were given an open design problem related to casting process. A short lecture about 35 minutes (Phase 0) was given and theh each student team created and uploaded an instructional material (video) on their approach for solving the open-ended problem using computers and mobile phones (Phase I). The students then critically evaluated and posted feedbacks on these peer videos (Phase II). The.final step of the process involved students writing a short report on their modified problem solving process and then applied the process to the same open-ended problem (Phase III). The students used comments from peers and information from other videos to modify and improve their approaches. Student learning in all three phases (Phase I through III) was assessed to understand the effects of different modes of learning in TeatoL. Paired t-test, regression and correlation analysis were used to determine the learning gains and how learning happens in a flat learning environment. Paired t-test analysis showed that there were significant learning gains from peer information exchange in TeatoL. Regression and Correlation analysis suggests that number of in-depth comments exchanged during Phase II depends on the initial level of knowledge; and learning gains of students depend on the meaningful comments provided by their peers. The results suggest that, in an online environment, peer-to-peer information exchange in the form of feedback can be particularly useful to attract, retain and train URM students as well as academically under prepared students.

AB Arduino boards, a current trending open-source platform technology, are being used by museums and other institutions to create interactive exhibits for their patrons. Academic libraries are often faced with the challenge of finding new inspirations to educate and engage patrons. The Illuminated Lifestyles exhibit at Binghamton University was an attempt to teach library users about the sensory experiences of medieval manuscripts using touch technology. Relatively inexpensive, these boards can be incorporated in various ways to make an exhibit interactive. In this case, the boards were used in conjunction with large-scale frames covered with digitized replicas of manuscript leaves that spoke to the viewer as they touched the images. This case study explains the technology and platforms used within the exhibit and what the long-term impacts and benefits, if any, the library experienced.

AB In this paper a new open-source and open-hardware framework for Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) control is described. The hardware is based on CIAA (Computadora Industrial Abierta Argentina) and Arduino modules while the software is based on NuttX real-time operating system (RTOS). For communication, the MAVlink protocol is used, also enabling interfacing with ROS (Robot Operating System). The framework can be employed for different style UGVs (differential drive, omnidirectional, skid steer) with different number of motorized wheels. It is designed for low-cost and ease of integration and adoption. The proposed framework was employed as the control system of a four-wheel skid-steer rover protoype developed by the authors, which is also described as a part of this work.

AB Precision aquaculture is a new tool developed in the field of information technology (IT) that allows the farmers having a better control of the farm processes, facilitate the decisions making, and improve the efficiency of the activity. The development of systems for continuous monitoring are important to aquaculture crops since these can detect unwanted conditions that can be harmful for organisms. In this study, are valued open hardware and artificial intelligence as alternative platforms to develop new monitoring systems. The proposed system automatically records the physicochemical variables of the water (dissolved oxygen, temperature and pH) and processes them using fuzzy logic (artificial intelligence) for the determination of the water quality index. The system was tested in a shrimp culture (Litopenaeus vannamei) with a size of 1.67 +/- 0.23g in a period of 84 days. The results show that the system analyzes the physicochemical variables most important of a shrimp culture and were able to qualify as a water quality index: poor, good and excellent according to the optimal thresholds required by the crop.

TI An Open Framework for Participatory PM2.5 Monitoring in Smart Cities
SO IEEE ACCESS
LA English
DT Article
DE Air pollution; crowdsourcing; environmental monitoring; Internet of
   Things
AB As the population in cities continues to increase rapidly, air pollution becomes a serious issue from public health to social economy. Among all pollutants, fine particulate matters (PM2.5) directly related to various serious health concerns, e.g., lung cancer, premature death, asthma, and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. To enhance the quality of urban living, sensors are deployed to create smart cities. In this paper, we present a participatory urban sensing framework for PM2.5 monitoring with more than 2500 devices deployed in Taiwan and 29 other countries. It is one of the largest deployment project for PM2.5 monitor in the world as we know until May 2017. The key feature of the framework is its open system architecture, which is based on the principles of open hardware, open source software, and open data. To facilitate the deployment of the framework, we investigate the accuracy issue of low-cost particle sensors with a comprehensive set of comparison evaluations to identify the most reliable sensor. By working closely with government authorities, industry partners, and maker communities, we can construct an effective eco-system for participatory urban sensing of PM2.5 particles. Based on our deployment achievements to date, we provide a number of data services to improve environmental awareness, trigger on-demand responses, and assist future government policymaking. The proposed framework is highly scalable and sustainable with the potential to facilitate the Internet of Things, smart cities, and citizen science in the future.

   Experiment
AB Common problems faced in optical comprehensive design experiment and going against the Washington Accord are pointed out. For resolving these problems, an instructional and innovative teaching scheme for Optics Comprehensive Design Experiment is proposed. We would like to understand the student that can improve the hands-on practical ability, theory knowledge understanding ability, complex problem solving ability, engineering application ability, cooperative ability after tracking and researching the student who have attended the class about Optical Comprehensive Design Experiment, We found that there are some problems on the course such as the experiment content vague, the student beginning less time, phase separation theory and engineering application, the experiment content lack of selectivity and so on. So we have made some improvements reference to the Washington Accord for the class teaching plan about Optical Comprehensive Design Experiment. This class must relevant to the engineering basic courses, professional foundation course and the major courses, so far as to the future study and work that which can play a role in inheriting and continuity to the students. The Optical Comprehensive Design Experiment teaching program requires students learning this course to have learnt basic courses like analog electronics technique, digital electronic technique, applied optics and computer and other related courses which students are required to comprehensively utilize. This teaching scheme contains six practical complex engineering problems which are respectively optical system design, light energy meter design, illuminometer design, material refractive index measuring system design, light intensity measuring system design and open design. Establishing the optional experiment and open experiment can provide students with a greater choice and enhance the students' creativity, vivid teaching experimental teachers and enriching contents of experiment can make the experiment more interesting, providing students with more opportunities to conduct experiment and improving students' practical ability with long learning time, putting emphasis on student's understanding of complex engineering problems and the cognitive of the process to solve complex engineering problems with actual engineering problems. Applying the scheme in other courses and improving accordingly will be able to ensure the quality of engineering education. Look forward to offering useful reference for the curriculum system construction in colleges and universities.

AB Infrastructure monitoring applications currently lack a cost-effective and reliable solution for supporting the last communication hop for low-power devices. The use of cellular infrastructure requires contracts and complex radios that are often too power hungry and cost prohibitive for sensing applications that require just a few bits of data each day. New low-power, sub-GHz, long-range radios are an ideal technology to help fill this communication void by providing access points that are able to cover multiple kilometers of urban space with thousands of end-point devices. These new Low-Power WideArea Networking (LPWAN) platforms provide a cost-effective and highly deployable option that could piggyback off of existing public and private wireless networks (WiFi, Cellular, etc). In this paper, we present OpenChirp, a prototype end-toend LPWAN architecture built using LoRa Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN) with the goal of simplifying the design and deployment of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices across wide areas like campuses and cities. We present a software architecture that exposes an application layer allowing users to register devices, describe transducer properties, transfer data and retrieve historical values. We define a service model on top of LoRaWAN that acts as a session layer to provide basic encoding and syntax to raw data streams. At the device-level, we introduce and benchmark an open-source hardware platform that uses Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) to help provision LoRa clients that can be extended with custom transducers. We evaluate the system in terms of end-node energy consumption, radio penetration into buildings as well as coverage provided by a network currently deployed at Carnegie Mellon University.

AB The OpenOrbiter CubeSat Development Initiative is working to build a small spacecraft system using open source software and open hardware principles. Some important design considerations for the CubeSat are nonfunctional requirements. The key contribution of this work is presenting the design of a requirement engineering tool that can be used to speed up the requirement elicitation and specification of system-wide qualities such as availability, performance, and security based on the use of quality attribute scenarios. A prototype application, utilizing the concept of quality attribute scenarios which was originally proposed by the Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute (SEI), was designed and implemented. These quality attribute scenarios are the equivalent of UML scenarios and use-cases. They are built specifically to document the nonfunctional requirements and use a quality scenario template.

AB In pursuit of coping mechanisms for the challenges of sustainable manufacturing, systematic methods have been developed to allow engineers to improve the ratio between products' utility and environmental impact. These necessary efforts remain however limited if the surrounding production and consumption practices are not called into question at the same time. This article introduces open source product development as a potential approach for unlocking the limits of existing sustainable product design practices and to lead towards alternative and eco-efficient production and consumption practices termed as participative production. First, it discusses the potential advantages of this emerging practice in terms of environmental sustainability. Second, it provides a screened qualitative environmental analysis of 18 exemplary open source hardware products. Specific sustainable design principles implemented by these products are highlighted and discussed in order to identify challenges for further common research in the field of open source and sustainable product development.

AB With the rapid growth of a number of elderly people around the world, an increasing need has arisen in providing physical security to them. Researchers have been working in developing such monitoring systems for the past decades. However, the needs of elderly people and their families are yet to be fulfilled, especially since the developed existing systems need their users to change their lifestyles. This work aims at suggesting a system for monitoring the occupancy of an elderly person on the bed. Capacitive proximity sensing system has been proven to be a probable solution for indoor localization, which senses the presence of a human body. Nevertheless, the requirements for installation are many, which make the integration costly. In this paper, a flexible and integrated solution is proposed that makes use of inexpensive, open source hardware, allowing indoor localization and fall detection. The bed monitoring system is made up of aluminum sheets sensor electrodes installed under the bed sheets to detect the sleeping patterns of the subject. An alarm system has been integrated into the room to enable the elderly to call for help during an emergency. Presence detector and light controlling device are installed on the floor surface to detect the mobility of the elderly and turn ON/OFF the room lights automatically. The proposed system allows elderly people to live independent living at homes with all amenities.

AB In this paper, the subject of embedded systems education in the Arduino age is examined. Arduino is an open-source microcontroller platform that has been widely popular in the past decade among hobbyists and academics. Arduino is increasingly being adopted in courses that span different disciplines in schools and universities. As a result, numerous papers are being published every year in different engineering education conferences and journals reporting the integration of Arduino in teaching. In this work, the impact of Arduino on embedded systems education is investigated. First, challenges facing embedded systems education are identified from the literature. Second, different Arduino teaching integration methodologies reported in the literature are surveyed and analyzed. Third, the question whether Arduino successfully addresses embedded education challenges or not is discussed taking both surveyed findings and recent market trends into consideration. Finally, a number of openended research directions are proposed.

AB Microprocessor (uP) Architecture and Programming constitute core courses in computer science and electronic engineering departments. A variety of tools has been used for gaining more knowledge and understanding the basic and advanced concepts of the course. These tools (hardware platforms and simulators) are focused mainly on assembly programming. Despite the existing tools, students still face great learning difficulties. On the other hand, key issues are the corresponding architecture and the programming features of the uP under studying. The above issues are not fully addressed by the existing tools. In this paper, a customizable hardware based uP simulator is presented and final proposed. Using this simulator, an experimental hypothetical educational uP can be built by students and the professors can create the corresponding learning scenarios. Based on the proposed approach, the experimental uP consists of identical hardware based blocks that can be reprogrammed for representing registers, arithmetic and logic unit, etc. Thus, the students can act now as uP architecture and assembly language designers gaining crucial knowledge in the field.

AB In recent years, many internet of things (IoT) platforms based on cloud computing have been proposed for general purpose applications. Though many similar platforms or schemes particular for smart home applications have been proposed, many issues such as multiple connectivity due to diversity of smart home applications and supporting for real-time operations have not been solved properly. We propose a smart home foundation scheme adopting open source hardware devices and cloud computing technology to explore these issues. In this scheme, Arduino Yun-based smart hardware devices can connect to the cloud server through multiply network connectivity. By utilising Spacebrew technology, a bidirectional real-time communication can be implemented which provides a solid foundation for real-time operations of smart home. The core functions of the scheme are exposed through RESTful web services in a SaaS (short for software as a service) manner and can be called by various clients and other applications. Demonstrative applications show that the proposed smart home foundation scheme provides adequate support for creating smart home applications based on wireless open source hardware devices.

DT Article
DE Arduino due; rapid control prototyping (RCP); block libraries;
   high-speed USB interface
AB In this paper, we propose a light-weight rapid control prototyping (RCP) system based on off-the-shelf open source hardware to achieve high performance computing, cost effectiveness, portability, and easy accessiblity. The proposed RCP system consists of a PC-based computer-aided control system design (CACSD) tool for computing control action and tiny palm-sized open source hardware for input and output (I/O) operation and data transfer through a built-in high-speed USB interface. The popular-priced and portable open source hardware is used as a bridge between CACSD tools and real plants to deliver the control and sensor data at the sampling time points. Ten I/O function blocks written in C code are developed based on the CACSD tool employed for the proposed light-weight RCP system in order to handle I/O operation in a simple way. In addition, we suggest two practical strategies, a batch transfer strategy and a variable sampling period method, to increase the sampling rate of the control system. It is shown through experiment that the proposed light-weight RCP system works well up to a sampling rate of 2 kHz without adopting expensive hardware and C code generators. It is expected that the proposed RCP system will be considered as affordable and readily available to schools for mass education.

AB Purpose - Smart eyewear, such as augmented or virtual reality headset, allows the projection of virtual content through a display worn on the user's head. This paper aims to present a mobile platform, named "CARTON", which transforms a smartphone into smart eyewear, following a do-it-yourself (DIY) approach. This platform is composed of three main components: a blueprint to build the hardware prototype with very simple materials and regular tools; a software development kit (SDK) to help with the development of new applications (e.g. augmented reality app); and, finally, a second SDK (ControlWear) to interact with mobile applications through a Smartwatch.
   Design/methodology/approach - User experiments were conducted, in which participants were asked to create, by themselves, the CARTON's hardware part and perform usability tests with their own creation. A second round of experimentation was conducted to evaluate three different interaction modalities.
   Findings - Qualitative user feedback and quantitative results prove that CARTON is functional and feasible to anyone, without specific skills. The results also showed that ControlWear had the most positive results, compared with the other interaction modalities, and that user interaction preference would vary depending on the task.
   Originality/value - The authors describe a novel way to create a smart eyewear available for a wide audience around the world. By providing everything open-source and open-hardware, they intend to solve the reachability of technologies related to smart eyewear and aim to accelerate research around it.

AB This paper elucidates the design and implementation of a low-cost wireless intelligent two hand gesture recognition system. The proposed system consists of a primary and secondary sub-system which work in tandem to recognize static gestures signed by the user. Each of the sub-systems consists of a sensory glove, embedded with custom made, low-cost flex and contact sensors interfaced with a ATMega328 microcontroller. The two sub-systems are wirelessly inter-connected through a pair of TI's CC2541 Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) modules. The system recognizes gestures with the help of a Dual-mode Intelligent Agent (DIA) which operates in Identification Mode (IM) and intelligently switches to Enhanced Identification Mode (EIM) when the gesture fails to get recognized in IM. The EIM incorporates a Bit Stream Error Elimination (BSEE) algorithm which enhances the gesture recognition accuracy without the addition of any external hardware. The performance of the system was evaluated using a data set comprising of 196 static gestures from eight globally used sign languages. The system efficiency was found to be 80.06% in IM and was enhanced to 93.16% in EIM. The cost of the proposed system in prototype stage is USD 22, which the authors believe could be realized at under USD 10 on commercialization.

AB In this paper, we study code clones in hardware description languages (HDLs) in comparison with general programming languages. For this purpose, we have developed a method for detecting code clones in Verilog HDL. A key idea of the proposed method is to convert the Verilog HDL code into the pseudo C++ code, which is then processed by an existing code clone detector for C++. We conducted an experiment on 10 open source hardware products described in Verilog HDL, where we succeeded in detecting nearly 1,800 clone sets with approximately 80% precision. We compared code clones in Verilog HDL with those in Java/C based on the metrics to identify the differences among languages. We identified patterns on how code clones are created in Verilog HDL, which include cases for increasing stability and capability of parallel processing of the circuit.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a solution for the levelling plate of fused deposition modelling (FDM) additive manufacturing (AM) systems. This automatic levelling system is presented as an evolution of actual systems, which uses a new ultrasound sensing system.
   Design/methodology/approach - After obtaining a prototype, different tests were conducted for getting a system which solves the level plate problem and can be mounted in any FDM AM machine. Several benchmark models were obtained and compared with current equipment concepts for the validity of the product.
   Findings - All tests were performed with high accuracy, enabling the production of geometries that could not have been achieved without this novel system.
   Practical implications - This development will enable experienced users to set aside the problems of calibration and focus on the purpose of this type of machines, making prototypes.
   Originality/value - A system architecture has been developed and integrated into an open hardware AM system, allowing real-time adjustment of the plate during each layer, thus eliminating the need of levelling the plate, allowing to achieve easier printing, and without increasing the cost significantly.

AB Open source design (OSD) is an emerging mode of product design. In OSD process, how to select right tasks directly influences the efficiency and quality of task completion, hence impacting the whole evolution process of OSD. In this paper, designer's bidirectional behavior of task selection integrating passive selection based on website recommendation and autonomous selection is modeled. First, the model of passive selection behavior by website recommendation is proposed with application of collaborative filtering algorithm, based on a three-dimensional matrix including information of design agents, tasks, and skills; second, the model of autonomous selection behavior is described in consideration of factors such as skill and incentive; third, the model of bidirectional selection behavior is described integrating the aforementioned two selection algorithms. At last, contrast simulation analysis of bidirectional selection, passive selection based on website recommendation, and autonomous selection is proposed with ANOVA, and results show that task selection behavior has significant effect on OSD evolution process and that bidirectional selection behavior is more effective to shorten evolution cycle according to the experiment settings. In addition, the simulation study testifies the model of bidirectional selection by describing the task selection process of OSD in microperspective.

ID TECHNOLOGY; COMMUNITY
AB Fab Labs, fabrication laboratories, are shared workshops where citizens can access digital fabrication equipment to design and make their own objects. They are proliferating rapidly and represent an alternative to mass production and consumption, an ideology whose environmental and social benefits their "makers" like to espouse. A longitudinal ethnographic study in a Fab Lab in a European design school examined the Lab's ideology building, how ideals were enacted and where compromises were visible. Environmental issues were intertwined with other ideological concerns, but they were rarely promoted in their own right. Engagement with sustainability-oriented makers and stakeholders is recommended.

TI A Comparison of Different Techniques for Interfacing Capnography With

SO RESPIRATORY CARE

   volumetric capnography
ID TIDAL CARBON-DIOXIDE; MAINSTREAM; SEDATION
AB BACKGROUND: Accurately measuring the partial pressure of end-tidal CO2 (P-ETCO2) in nonintubated patients is problematic due to dilution of expired CO2 at high O-2 flows and mask designs that may either cause CO2 rebreathing or inadequately capture expired CO2. We evaluated the performance of 2 capnographic O-2 masks (Cap-ONE and OxyMask) against a clinically expedient method using a standard O2 mask with a flow-directed nasal cannula used for capnography (CapnoLine) in a spontaneous breathing model of an adult and child under conditions of normal ventilation, hypoventilation, and hyperventilation. METHODS: An ASL-5000 simulator was attached to a manikin face with a catheter port, through which various CO2/air mixtures were bled into the ASL-5000 to achieve a P-ETCO2 of 40, 65, and 30 mm Hg. Both P-ETCO2 and inspired P-CO2 were measured at O-2 flows of 5, 10, 15, and 20 L/min (adult model) and 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 L/min (pediatric model). RESULTS: P-ETCO2 decreased to varying degrees as O-2 flow increased, depending upon the breathing pattern. Although all devices appeared to perform reasonably well under normal and hyperventilation conditions, the clinically expedient method was associated with substantially more CO2 rebreathing. P-ETCO2 usually deteriorated more under simulated hypoventilation, regardless of the measurement method. CONCLUSIONS: Both of the specially designed O-2 capnography masks provided reasonably stable P-ETCO2 without significant CO2 rebreathing at the commonly used O-2 flows. Because of their open design, P-ETCO2 measured at high O-2 flows may produce artificially lower readings that may not reflect arterial CO2 levels compared with lower O-2 flows.

AB The aim of this paper is to develop a low cost open source Controller Area Network system that simulates electronic controls in modern automotive vehicles and to evaluate its effectiveness as a teaching aid. The Arduino UNO microcontroller hoard was chosen as the desired hardware platform and the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) using the Arduino compiler was chosen as the software development environment. Both the Arduino Uno and Arduino IDE/compiler are open source and freely available to students and staff with no proprietary intellectual property costs.
   The Arduino UNO was interfaced with the Arduino Controller Area Network Bus (CANBus) shield which is also open hardware. Unitec Institute of Technology practices a holistic approach to teaching. As part of its holistic approach to teaching, senior students are encouraged to develop technical artefacts that can be used as teaching aids for junior students, the junior students are introduced to the artefact as part of their course and the artefact is used to encourage junior students to increase their technical proficiency so that when they reach a senior technical level they can develop artefacts too. The holistic approach is considered to he self-sustaining and provides positive role modelling for junior students. The project described in this paper was developed by a senior student and has been used as a teaching aid for junior students congruent with the holistic teaching philosophy practiced at Unitec. The code and circuitry was designed by an exchange Masters student and was used in the papers, APTE 7504 Vehicle Electronic Diagnostics and APTE 6505 Automotive Electronics, to help students understand CANBus operation and design features in an Automotive CANBus application.

AB A low-cost, low power consumption indoor environment monitoring instrument, called SKOMOBO (school monitoring box), was developed and tested. SKOMOBO includes sensors to monitor temperature/relative humidity, carbon dioxide (CO2), particulate matter and motions. SKOMOBO was developed using the open source hardware Arduino Pro Mini. This paper describes the process of building SKOMOBO, including sensor selection, printed circuit board design, sensor programming and performance evaluation. Two co-located tests have been undertaken; one in the controlled environment and one in the uncontrolled environment. Results show SKOMOBO measurements have high correlations with their commercial equivalents. In the two different testing environments, the R-2 of temperature measurements for all six SKOMOBOs were 1. The R-2 for relative humidity and CO2 measurements were above 0.9. The result of this work shows the reliability of SKOMOBO on monitoring indoor air quality.

AB Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are increasingly becoming integral parts of many non-electrical fields of engineering, e.g., Precision Agriculture, Avionics, Bionics, Civionics, and so on. Modern mechanical engineering is nearly synonymous with Mechatronics, and more recently Mechaphonics, viz., study of mechanical systems controlled by mobile phone apps, has become popular. Pneumatics, or compressed air, and hydraulics are niche areas of mechanical engineering with many industrial and other applications, and their performance is enhanced by incorporating electronic hardware and computer software. Many of these systems are also good examples of so-called smart products and Internet of Things. In this paper, an affordable build-your-own (BYO) computer control system is designed and developed for hands-on instruction in electro-pneumatics education. Results of implementation of a proof-of-concept prototype system using low-cost components, open source hardware and free open source software, are presented to illustrate the practical utility of the proposed system.

ID IMPACT
AB Prosopis juliflora is a small weed tree, native to Central and South America, and the Caribbean, which has become a major invasive weed in Asia, including India, Latin America, Africa and Australia. It has major detrimental impact on scarce, underground water resources, takes over the local flora ecosystems and affects the soil environment. Manual removal of saplings is time-consuming and expensive. Presently, the removal of the weed is performed manually which is time-consuming, or using very expensive commercial heavy equipment. In this paper, an affordable and innovative unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) system is designed and developed for autonomous identification and removal of the weed seedlings and saplings. Results of implementation of a proof-of-concept prototype system using mainly commercial off-the-shelf components, open source hardware and free open source software, are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB This paper presents a solution for different activities concerning shrimp farming, especially focused on the middle-class artisanal productive sector, using both open source hardware and open source software. The proposal aims to optimize monitoring during shrimp farming, measuring parameters, such as dissolved oxygen, water temperature and food levels inside reservoirs, in order to have a real-time reading of parameters. In case critical values appear, an alarm activates by control center, notifying by either electronic mail or web interface. The attractiveness of the proposal consists in the automation of the feeding system, which provides food supply to shrimps at certain daily periods, controlling by web interface the different options the breeder has available, a process that can be even managed remotely.

AB Balsa provides an open-source design flow where asynchronous circuits are created from high-level specifications, but the syntaxdriven translation often results in performance overhead. To improve this, we exploit the fact that bundled-data circuits can be divided into data and control path. Hence, tailored optimisation techniques can be applied to both paths separately. For control path optimisation, STG-based resynthesis has been used (applying logic minimisation). To continue the investigation, we additionally apply synchronous standard tools to optimise the data path. However, this removes the matched delays needed for a properly working bundled-data circuit. Therefore, we also present two algorithms to automatically insert proper matched delays. Our experiments show a performance improvement of up to 44% and energy consumption improvement of up to 60% compared to the original Balsa implementation.

AB This paper presents a case study on emerging challenges within collaborative innovation projects engaging open communities. Innovation driven by open communities has proven to have a significant potential, in particular for open source software. However, tools and methodologies enabling the supervision of collaborative innovation involving open communities, in the perspective of creating open hardware to solve societal issues, remains at the early stages. This paper seeks to pinpoint the potentialities and challenges of such projects toward defining methods to better support a multi-stakeholders open source collaboration context. The experimental field of this research concerns the smart electricity distribution, and more precisely a public driven project of the diffusion of smart-meters in France and their appropriation by open source communities, with the involvement of the university and a public industrial company. The project seeks to study how these communities of users develop in a collaborative manner, new products and services using the smart-meter as a support technology. The first results show that the open community makes natural connection on specific environments such as Smart buildings to materialize usages of smart meters.

AB The use of open hardware for non-programmers in higher education is an added value for the achievement of projects by students of arts and design. On the one hand we are using what the community has to offer and on the other we are enabling students to use open technologies, so that they can use them with respect to their licenses.
   These technologies, often presented as difficult to use, with long learning curves, compared to other programs whose students and some teachers are more accustomed to use, have a greater value if they can be used freely and in any type of project. Whether in an academic setting or in the final product environment for a particular client.
   It is important to de-emphasize their use with the students and to show that they can be used in the classroom in a creative way or to carry out other types of projects.

AB This paper introduces a low-cost AC meter designed to continuously measure voltage and current waveforms at up to 14 kHz. The AC power meter, provided as open hardware, is designed using the same micro controller as the Arduino UNO1 with an In-system Programming (ISP) interface, thus allowing the user to change the firmware to match their particular use case using Arduino libraries or standard C language. The suggested design is compatible with the Raspberry Pi 3(2), making it a suitable real-time measurement accessory for the single board computer. The platform features an 8 channel simultaneous sampling Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) which allows a high fidelity sampling without time offsets. Depending on how the user decides to combine current transformers (CTs) and AC-AC voltage adapters for the input channels, circuit breakers or appliances can be measured in either one phase or three phases.

Based on previous research and user studies, HeartBeats addresses a growing need for design to support ritualization of digital data in the context of bereavement. Our aim is to stimulate discussion about digital immortality and afterlife. By challenging perceived characteristics and qualities of inherited data, we hope to open design spaces to better enable ritualization of digital objects in bereavement.

AB Open source innovation is a well-studied phenomenon of the ICT sector, but its evolution towards the field of tangible hardware product development is a newer phenomenon which remains mostly theoretical. Existing literature has identified that to push existing open source product development (OSPD) practice towards the achievement of high quality complex products, methods and tools adapted to this specific organisation of work are needed. The objective of this article is to explore the practices emerging from OSPD communities in order to support the development of appropriate process support in the future. It reports first observations made during a qualitative and comparative empirical study performed with participants of 23 OSPD projects through semi-directed interviews. Activating a formerly published framework, these observations address four themes: the organizational structure of OSPD's surrounding communities, their design process, their underlying business models and the supporting online tools they use. The preliminary results are delivered to the engineering design and management scientific community as an impulse for further research.

AB The open-source approach arose in the computer industry. It now also impacts physical goods. In order to benefit from alleged benefit of open-design for tangible artefact, it appears needed to model this design process. We thus studied the 12 projects that took part to the PoC21 innovation camp, and construct a model based on interviews of projects stakeholders we have conducted. To develop the model, we followed the methodology of the grounded theory. The two main contributions of this paper are: first, the model of the open-design; and second, the methodology we used to construct this model. We have found that it is possible to use the grounded theory framework for formalizing implicit processes. Our model depicts the open-design process as a process, which features resemble to both traditional product design processes, and open-source software development processes. However, it also presents specifics that are not shown in any of these models detailed in literature. This model can serve as a basic for future prescriptive research on open-design. Moreover, we recommend a grounded-theory based methodology to model undocumented and implicit design processes.

DE 3D printing; Open source design; Case study
AB The purpose of this paper is to explore the implications of the tight coupling of manufacturing technologies and the extent to which it can facilitate the realisation of self-replicating production resources. This was explored through a three year programme of development projects where multiple 3D printing and milling machines were designed, built and evaluated with respect to their manufacturing capabilities and self-replicability. It was found that this tight coupling of processes increased functionality, self-replicability and consequentially utility of these machines. The project specifications were used to identify conflicting requirements and qualitatively assess their interrelationships. Further work will see this expanded into a quantitative model to identify where design effort should be focused and also theoretical limits of self-replicability. The principal social implication of this work is that non-autotrophic self-replication, upon which the RepRap philosophy is based, is largely dependent upon locally available technology and resources. Self-replication therefore becomes an affordance of not solely machine but also of environment.

AB Engineering Design research relies on quantitative and qualitative data to describe design-related phenomena and prescribe improvements for design practice. Given data availability, privacy requirements and other constraints, most empirical data used in Engineering Design research can be described as "closed". Keeping such data closed is in many cases necessary and justifiable. However, this closedness also hinders replicability, and thus, may limit our possibilities to test the validity and reliability of research results in the field. This paper discusses implications and applications of using the already available and continuously growing body of open data sources to create opportunities for research in Engineering Design. Insights are illustrated by an examination of two examples: a study of open source software repositories and an analysis of open business registries in the cleantech industry. We conclude with a discussion about the limitations, challenges and risks of using open data in Engineering Design research and practice.

AB Active chlorophyll a fluorescence is an essential tool for understanding photosynthetic activity within cnidarian/dinoflagellate symbioses. Fluorescence measurement is typically achieved by utilizing a blue or red monochromatic excitation light source. However, algal photosynthetic pigments can differ in their absorption spectra, potentially leading to excitation wavelength dependent measurements of maximal and light acclimated PSII photosynthetic quantum yield (Fv/Fm or Fq'/Fm') and functional absorption cross section (sigma(PSII) or sigma(PSII)). Here we utilized an open source hardware development platform to construct a multispectral excitation fluorometer to assess spectrally dependent differences in photochemistry within four different Symbiodinium species (two of each ITS2-type A4 and B1). Multivariate analysis of light acclimated photochemical signatures showed separation between most alga types. These spectrally dependent differences in light acclimated PSII efficiency and PSII functional absorption cross section likely reflect changes in light harvesting compounds, their connectivity to the PSII reaction centers and the balance between photochemical and non-photochemical fluorescence quenching. Additionally, acclimation to low (20 iLmol photons M-2 s(-1)) and high (200 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) light conditions was examined in two of these symbionts types (ITS-2 type A4 and B1) As expected, chlorophyll a cell(-1) decreased under high light acclimation in both symbionts. However, only A4 saw a subsequent reduction in absorbance whereas cellular volume decreased in the B1 (S. minutum) symbiont. In response to high light acclimation, Fv/Fm was significantly lower at all excitation wavelengths for the B1 symbiont where as efficiencies remained the same for A4. However, high-light acclimated Fq'/Fm' levels decreased in both symbionts, but only when measured using the 615 or 625 nm excitation wavelengths. Non-photochemical quenching within the antennae bed was downregulated under high light acclimation in the A4 symbiont, but only when measured using the 505 and 530 nm excitation wavelengths. Such changes in Fq'/Fm' and antennae bed quenching highlight the benefits of spectrally resolved photochemical measurements. Additionally, the utilization of Arduino and Bitscope hardware exemplifies the potential of open source development platforms for construction of highly customizable instrumentation for photosynthetic research.

AB Traditionally unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs) have been large, complex and expensive. Development of UUVs has been driven by defense and commercial requirements. This has allowed for extensive research and development budgets and long development cycles. This paper briefly discuses these historic drivers and how this situation has changed. It focuses on a new compact affordable UUV.
   In 2015, several veterans of the conventional UUV sector set out to change the dynamics of the industry, founding Riptide Autonomous Solutions. Riptide's first offering was the micro-UUV, a new, highly flexible, open source autonomous undersea vehicle. The micro-UUV features open hardware and software interfaces giving users a reliable and robust platform to advance technology development. The vehicle design is optimized for high efficiency with the best hydrodynamic signature in its class. The base micro-UUV is 4 7/8 inches in diameter, 40 inches in length and weighs 22 lbs. The standard system is rated to a depth of 300 meters.
   This paper discuses the technical details of this UUV that make it distinctive and enabled its rapid development. The entire system was taken from design to initial delivery in under 12 months. Flexible and open software interfaces and use of modern three dimensional design and printing are key enablers of the rapid development. A highly optimized hydrodynamic design improves the speed and endurance of the vehicle, as does its compact size. Reducing control fins from the typical four to three reduces drag and enables active roll control steering, a further enhancement of the micro-UUV's performance. In addition to describing the novel features and approach of the micro-UUV design this paper will discuss the potential for a new aluminum seawater battery to extend the range of this compact vehicle to nearly 1000km.

AB Educational games have a potentially significant role to play in the increasing efforts to expand access to computer science education. Computational thinking is an area of particular interest, including the development of problem-solving strategies like divide and conquer. Existing games designed to teach computational thinking generally consist of either open-ended exploration with little direct guidance or a linear series of puzzles with lots of direct guidance, but little exploration. Educational research indicates that the most effective approach may be a hybrid of these two structures. We present Dragon Architect, an educational computational thinking game, and use it as context for a discussion of key open problems in the design of games to teach computational thinking. These problems include how to directly teach computational thinking strategies, how to achieve a balance between exploration and direct guidance, and how to incorporate engaging social features. We also discuss several important design challenges we have encountered during the design of Dragon Architect. We contend the problems we describe are relevant to anyone making educational games or systems that need to teach complex concepts and skills.

AB This paper presents the usage of Internet of Things concept as a tool for retrofitting air conditioning systems. The proposed technology consists in an embedded system developed with an open-source hardware platform and connected through a wireless sensor and actuator mesh network. By learning commands from the air conditioner's remote control, the system is capable of implementing automatic control of the air conditioner equipment. Through a central command unit, it is possible to configure timers to turn on and off all devices connected to the network. The system also adds intelligence to conventional equipment by making use of a motion sensor, avoiding electricity waste. An automatic temperature control is implemented through sensors that monitor external conditions. By making use of a mesh network based on DigiMesh protocol, each device acts like a router, increasing network range and making it easier to add or remove new devices. The proposed system was validated through case study.

AB In this paper, a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) solution is proposed for soil's condition measurement to monitor oil palm plantations (PalmNET) according to agricultural meteorological practices. The PalmNET monitoring system is composed by a WSN used for in-field soil's condition measurement and a web-server interface for data visualization. PalmNET can automatically collect soil moisture data and transmit field data through a ZigBee network to a web-server. The PalmNET proof-of-concept is a WSN built upon open-source hardware and software, which includes two sensor nodes, a sink and a Gateway with a GPRS module. The WSN was deployed in Palmar de la Vizcaina Experimental Field Station having the following proof of concept objectives: (i) collect and centralize soil moisture data and (ii) post data to a web application interface. Results have revealed PalmNET as a feasible, automated and solar powered application for oil palm plantations in Colombia.

ID TRENDS
AB The bending stiffness of the wind turbine blades has decreased due to the trend of wind turbine upsizing. Consequently, the risk of blades breakage by hitting the tower has increased. In order to prevent such incidents, this study proposes a deflection monitoring system that can be installed to already operating wind turbine's blades. The monitoring system is composed of an estimation algorithm to detect blade deflection and a wireless sensor network as a hardware equipment. As for the estimation method for blade deflection, a strain-based estimation algorithm and an objective function for optimal sensor arrangement are proposed. Strain-based estimation algorithm is using a linear correlation between strain and deflections, which can be expressed in a form of a transformation matrix. The objective function includes the terms of strain sensitivity and condition number of the transformation matrix between strain and deflection. In order to calculate the objective function, a simplified experimental model of the blade is constructed by interpolating the mode shape of a blade from modal testing. The interpolation method is effective considering a practical use to operating wind turbines' blades since it is not necessary to establish a finite element model of a blade. On the other hand, a sensor network with wireless connection with an open source hardware is developed. It is installed to a 300 W scale wind turbine and vibration of the blade on operation is investigated. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved..

AB This paper reviews a new real-time measurement instrument dedicated for online neutron monitoring with fission chambers in nuclear reactors. The instrument implements the higher order Campbelling methods and self-monitoring capabilities on an open source development board. The board includes an CPU/FPGA System on a Chip.
   The feasibility of the measurement instrument was tested both in laboratory with a signal generator and in the Minerve reactor. It is shown that the instrument provides reliable and robust count rate estimation over a wide reactor power range based on the third order statistics of the fission chamber signal. In addition, the system is able to identify whether the measured count rate change is due to the malfunction of the detector or due to the change in the neutron flux. The applied self-monitoring method is based on the spectral properties of the fission chamber signal. During the experimental verification, the considered malfunction was the change of the polarization voltage. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Microcontroller to another designed for the connection of sensors and actuators is also illustrated. The sensors were selected based on the technical characteristics of broilers breeding process, used to measure temperature, humidity, light intensity, ammonia, carbon monoxide and flammable gases. According to the present study, this module should be placed at a height between 0.80 and 1.5 m. and out of direct influence of heaters or fans, this way; it is optimized to send measurements wirelessly, using ZigBee protocol to a computer that, using developed software, compares them with parameters considered normal. It was also developed a web application and implemented, for monitoring and control from anywhere. Using this system, a mortality rate of 0.2% and weight gain averages above 2600 g were obtained, which justifies the project and is an option to be considered by poultry, due to the savings of resources obtained.

AB The reasons for the inferior performance of many existing buildings and associated energy systems are diverse, but an important part-cause is insufficient attention to the influence of occupant behaviour. In smart buildings it is necessary to allow for the integration of human behaviour in the HVAC system. In addition, many researchers are limited in their investigation by not having low cost tools that can provide information for their studies. This article is a review of the present state of art about the globe thermometer. It describes how to build your own globe temperature sensor and describes experiments that illustrate the feasibility of using a black globe thermometer with 40 mm diameter.

AB The paper explores the change process that university teachers need to go through in order to become fluent with Open Education approaches. Based on a literature review and a set of interviews with a number of leading experts in the field of Open Educational Resources and Open Education, the paper puts forward an original definition of Open Educator which takes into account all the components of teachers' work: learning design, teaching resources, pedagogical approaches and assessment methods- of teachers' activities. Subsequently, to help the development of teachers' openness capacity, the definition is further developed into a holistic framework for teachers, which takes into account all the dimensions of openness included in the definition and which provides teachers with self-development paths along each dimension. By working on the definition and on the framework with the interviewed experts, the paper concludes that a strong relation exists between the use of open approaches and the networking and collaboration attitude of university teachers, and that in order to overcome the technical and cultural barriers that hinder the use of open approaches in Higher Education, it is important to work on the transition phases- in terms of awareness and of capacity building- that teachers have to go through in their journey towards openness.

AB Sustainability of irrigation practices is an important objective to be pursued in many countries, especially in regions where water scarcity causes strong conflicts among different water uses. The efficient use of irrigation water is a key factor in coping with the food demands of an increasing world population and with the negative effects of climate change on water resource availability in many areas. In this complex context, it is important that farmers can rely on instruments and practices that enable a better management of water at the field scale, whatever the irrigation method they adopt.
   In this paper, we present an open-hardware device based on the Arduino technology that was developed to allow the continuous monitoring of soil water potential in the root zone for supporting irrigation scheduling at the field scale. The structure of the device is flexible and can be adapted to host different types of sensors. The results, obtained managing irrigation in a peach orchard, show that adoption of the device, together with a simple irrigation scheduling criterion, allowed a significant increase of water use efficiency without causing a reduction of the quantity and quality of crop production.

AB An in-house solution for the verification of dose delivered to a moving phantom as required for the clinical implementation of lung stereotactic ablative body radiation therapy was developed. The superior-inferior movement required to simulate tumour motion during a normal breathing cycle was achieved via the novel use of an Arduino Uno (TM), a low-cost open-source microcontroller board connected to a high torque servo motor. Slow CT imaging was used to acquire the image set and a 4D cone beam CT (4D-CBCT) verified the efficacy of contoured margins before treatment on the moving phantom. Treatment fields were delivered to a section of a CIRS (TM) anthropomorphic phantom. Dose verification to the dynamic phantom with Gafchromic EBT3 film using 3 %-1 mm gamma analysis acceptance criteria registered an absolute dose pass rate for IMRT and VMAT of 98 and 96.6 %, respectively. It was verified that 100 % of the PTV received the prescribed dose of 12 Gy per fraction using the dynamic phantom, and no major discrepancy between planned and measured results due to interplay between multileaf collimator sequences and target motion was observed. This study confirmed that the use of an in-house solution using open source hardware and software with existing quality assurance equipment was appropriate in validating a new treatment technique.

AB We introduce a multi-functional microscope for research laboratories that have significant cost and space limitations. The microscope pivots around the sample, operating in upright, inverted, side-on and oblique geometries. At these geometries it is able to perform brightfield, fluorescence and qualitative ellipsometric imaging. It is the first single instrument in the literature to be able to perform all of these functionalities. The system can be assembled by two undergraduate students from a provided manual in less than a day, from off-the-shelf and 3D printed components, which together cost approximately $ 16k at 2016 market prices. We include a highly specified assembly manual, a summary of design methodologies, and all associated 3D-printing files in hopes that the utility of the design outlives the current component market. This open design approach prepares readers to customize the instrument to specific needs and applications. We also discuss how to select household LEDs as low-cost light sources for fluorescence microscopy. We demonstrate the utility of the microscope in varied geometries and functionalities, with particular emphasis on studying hydrated, solidsupported lipid films and wet biological samples.

AB Software bugs are a critical threat to the deployability and maintainability of low-power wireless sensors, resulting in excess power consumption, hardware misconfigurations, incorrect data, and shortened device lifetimes. Worse, these errors can prevent wireless reprogramming, resulting in longer delays and costly human interventions. This letter describes shoulder angel-an ultra-low-power, low-cost, open hardware and software platform that ensures users can always recover and reprogram wireless sensors, in spite of software errors. Shoulder angel uses a physically separate coprocessor to monitor a device's power consumption and other behaviors, while keeping the device in a reprogrammable state. Our results show that shoulder angel is able to recover from otherwise fatal software errors while incurring an energy overhead of only 7 mu W.

AB A reliable and cheap equipment is hereby proposed for the deposition of thin films on several substrates. This system is capable of deposition using three different techniques sequentially on the same substrate. The techniques available are ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR), electrodeposition, and dip coating on both rigid and flexible conductive substrates (FTO, ITO-PEN). Using low-cost electronic components, we built a working prototype, driven by a simple software that is open source and user-friendly. In order to test our system, we used it to fabricate dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and counter electrodes of platinum and cobalt sulfide using both rigid glass-FTO and flexible ITO-PEN substrates. The electrodes as well as the complete devices have been characterized through cyclic voltammetry (CV). The solar cell devices have been characterized through current versus voltage curves (I-V) under simulated solar illumination.

AB Extensional shear testing is often needed to characterise the behaviour of complex fluids found in industry and nature. Traditional extensional rheometers are typically expensive, fragile and heavy and are only suited to making measurements in a laboratory environment. For some applications, it is necessary to make in situ rheological measurements where, for example, fluid properties change rapidly over time or where laboratory facilities are unavailable. This paper reports the development and validation of an inexpensive, lightweight and robust 'open source' extensional rheometer, Seymour II. Validation was carried out experimentally and computationally. Measurements on a Newtonian fluid (492 mPa s Brookfield silicone oil) yielded results of 510 +/- 51 mPa s; these are comfortably within the range of +/- 10% which other authors have quoted for extensional techniques using laboratory rheometers. Comparison of the observed filament thinning dynamics to those obtained using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) gave good qualitative agreement. Use of Seymour II at the University of Cambridge Botanic Gardens revealed that the mucilage of the 'crane flower', Strelitzia reginae, was a viscoelastic fluid whose extensional response could be described by a two-mode Giesekus equation. Engineering drawings and image analysis code for Seymour II are available for download at the project website, www.seymourII.org/.

AB In optogenetics, researchers use light and genetically encoded photoreceptors to control biological processes with unmatched precision. However, outside of neuroscience, the impact of optogenetics has been limited by a lack of user-friendly, flexible, accessible hardware. Here, we engineer the Light Plate Apparatus (LPA), a device that can deliver two independent 310 to 1550 nm light signals to each well of a 24-well plate with intensity control over three orders of magnitude and millisecond resolution. Signals are programmed using an intuitive web tool named Iris. All components can be purchased for under $400 and the device can be assembled and calibrated by a non-expert in one day. We use the LPA to precisely control gene expression from blue, green, and red light responsive optogenetic tools in bacteria, yeast, and mammalian cells and simplify the entrainment of cyanobacterial circadian rhythm. The LPA dramatically reduces the entry barrier to optogenetics and photobiology experiments.

DE Shape Memory Alloy Actuator; Maker; Maker Culture; Reference Design
AB Today, maker culture as an extension of DIY culture is rapidly spreading in the world with the advent of open source hardware. Makers currently learn and use practical skills based on different reference designs that are available to makers through the Internet. However, Reference design of SMAs for makers is not provided sufficiently despite commercial applications for shape memory alloys (SMAs) in different industrial fields. The objective of this research was to develop reference design for actuators based on SMA wires so that makers could easily and quickly utilize and learn. This research began by exploring different cases of actuators based on SMA wires. Through these case studies, we extracted essential parameters and classified cases into the essential parameters in order to develop reference design for actuators based on SMA wires. In order to prove the validity of reference design developed in this research, this reference design was subjected to experiments and tested.

AB This paper presents a case study analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of using project-based learning (PBL) combined with collaborative learning (CL) and industry best practices, integrated with information communication technologies, open-source software, and open-source hardware tools, in a specialized microcontroller and embedded systems engineering Master's course. In addition to addressing industry requirements in both contents and methodology, the course develops capabilities and competencies in problem solving, independent learning, teamwork, and technical knowledge. Since PBL methodology alone does not ensure teamwork, it was complemented with CL. Design review meetings (as described in IEC 61160), deliverables, and organizational resources were also introduced to mirror industry demands. This structure integrated course content and student academic achievement in a simulated industrial environment. The course had students build a modular management system for home appliances, implementing control software on the "Arduino" open-source platform, as well as using wireless communications. The results show that teaching, learning, and student assessment processes can be improved by using PBL with CL. In addition, the introduction of industry practices, such us peer review meetings, brings academia closer to a real-world context.

AB Marine processes are observed with sensors from both the ground and space over large spatio-temporal scales. Citizen-based contributions can fill observational gaps and increase environmental stewardship amongst the public. For this purpose, tools and methods for citizen science need to (1) complement existing datasets; and (2) be affordable, while appealing to different user and developer groups. In this article, tools and methods developed in the 7th Framework Programme of European Union (EU FP 7) funded project Citclops (citizens' observatories for coast and ocean optical monitoring) are reviewed. Tools range from a stand-alone smartphone app to devices with Arduino and 3-D printing, and hence are attractive to a diversity of users; from the general public to more specified maker-and open labware movements. Standardization to common water quality parameters and methods allows long-term storage in regular marine data repositories, such as SeaDataNet and EMODnet, thereby providing open data access. Due to the given intercomparability to existing remote sensing datasets, these tools are ready to complement the marine datapool. In the future, such combined satellite and citizen observations may set measurements by the engaged public in a larger context and hence increase their individual meaning. In a wider sense, a synoptic use can support research, management authorities, and societies at large.

AB There are currently no standardized objective measures to assess beer quality based on the most significant parameters related to the first impression from consumers, which are visual characteristics of foamability, beer color and bubble size. This study describes the development of an affordable and robust robotic beer pourer using low-cost sensors, Arduino (R) boards, Lego (R) building blocks and servo motors for prototyping. The RoboBEER is also coupled with video capture capabilities (iPhone 5S) and automated post hoc computer vision analysis algorithms to assess different parameters based on foamability, bubble size, alcohol content, temperature, carbon dioxide release and beer color. Results have shown that parameters obtained from different beers by only using the RoboBEER can be used for their classification according to quality and fermentation type. Results were compared to sensory analysis techniques using principal component analysis (PCA) and artificial neural networks (ANN) techniques. The PCA from RoboBEER data explained 73% of variability within the data. From sensory analysis, the PCA explained 67% of the variability and combining RoboBEER and Sensory data, the PCA explained only 59% of data variability. The ANN technique for pattern recognition allowed creating a classification model from the parameters obtained with RoboBEER, achieving 92.4% accuracy in the classification according to quality and fermentation type, which is consistent with the PCA results using data only from RoboBEER. The repeatability and objectivity of beer assessment offered by the RoboBEER could translate into the development of an important practical tool for food scientists, consumers and retail companies to determine differences within beers based on the specific parameters studied.

AB Microbial water quality monitoring for the presence of faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) is a mandatory activity in many countries and is key in public health protection. Despite technological advances and a need for methodological improvements, chromogenic and fluorogenic enzymatic techniques remain the mainstays of water quality monitoring for both public health agencies and regulated utilities. We demonstrated that bioelectroanalytical approaches to FIB enumeration are possible and can be achieved using commercially available enzyme-specific resorufin glycosides, although these are expensive, not widely available or designed for purpose. Following this, we designed two naphthoquinone glycosides which performed better, achieving Escherichia coli detection in the range 5.0x10(2) to 5.0x10(5) CFUml(-1) 22-54% quicker than commercially available resorufin glycosides. The molecular design of the naphthoquinone glycosides requires fewer synthetic steps allowing them to be produced for as little as US$50 per kg. Tests with environmental samples demonstrated the low tendency for abiotic interference and that, despite specificity being maintained between -glucuronidase and -galactosidase, accurate enumeration of E.coli in environmental samples necessitates development of a selective medium. In comparison to a commercially available detection method, which has U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approval, our approach performed better at high organism concentrations, detecting 500 organisms in 9h compared with 13.5h for the commercial method. Bioelectroanalytical detection is comparable to current approved methods and with further development could result in improved detection times. A recent trend for low-cost open-source hardware means that automated, potentiostatically controlled E.coli detection systems could be constructed for less than US$100 per channel.

AB BackgroundAllergic Rhinitis Control Test (ARCT) has been validated for assessing allergic rhinitis (AR) control and identifying severe AR. The aim of the study was to assess the ARCT questionnaire as a tool for stepwise pharmacotherapy.
   MethodsA standard pharmacotherapy regimen from Step 1 (oral second-generation H1 antihistamine as needed) to Step 5 (oral corticosteroid) was carried out prospectively in a Chinese AR population. The AR patients were initiated with Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) appropriate step treatment and assessed with ARCT every 15 days. If ARCT score was equal or above 20 (controlled AR) and maintained for 15 days, the patient would finish the study; if ARCT score was strictly <20 (uncontrolled AR), the patient would receive higher step treatment according to a predefined open design up to Step 5. The different AR control subgroups were compared.
   ResultsA total of 255 patients were enrolled in the study; 5 patients dropped out and 2 (0.8%) were controlled at day 0, 85 (34.0%) at day 15, 177 (70.8%) at day 30, 222 (88.8%) at day 45, 241 (96.4%) at day 60 and 242 (96.8%) at day 75. Only 8 (3.2%) patients remained uncontrolled at the endpoint of the study. Patients with ARIA moderate/severe or persistent symptoms, moderate/severe impaired quality of life, asthma history, rhinorrhea and cough symptoms always needed up to Step 4 (nasal corticosteroid plus antihistamine) and prolonged treatments to achieve disease control.
   ConclusionsThe majority of AR can be controlled with standard stepwise treatment. ARCT offers an objective criterion for the stepwise pharmacotherapy of AR.

AB Open-source technology not only has facilitated the expansion of the greater research community, but by lowering costs it has encouraged innovation and customizable design. The field of automated microscopy has continued to be a challenge in accessibility due the expense and inflexible, noninterchangeable stages. This paper presents a low-cost, open-source microscope 3-D stage. A RepRap 3-D printer was converted to an optical microscope equipped with a customized, 3-D printed holder for a USB microscope. Precision measurements were determined to have an average error of 10 m at the maximum speed and 27 m at the minimum recorded speed. Accuracy tests yielded an error of 0.15%. The machine is a true 3-D stage and thus able to operate with USB microscopes or conventional desktop microscopes. It is larger than all commercial alternatives, and is thus capable of high-depth images over unprecedented areas and complex geometries. The repeatability is below 2-D microscope stages, but testing shows that it is adequate for the majority of scientific applications. The open-source microscope stage costs less than 3-9% of the closest proprietary commercial stages. This extreme affordability vastly improves accessibility for 3-D microscopy throughout the world.
   Lay description The concept of open-source technology stems from the developmental model of accessibility and ease of use, enabling an environment of continual improvement and open communication. This approach has the potential to dramatically change many fields of study including that of microscope use in research settings. Automated microscopy is often a challenging and inaccessible field due to the cost and non-interchangeable stages, the flat plate on which samples are placed for analysis. This paper presents a low-cost, open source microscope 3-D stage. A RepRap 3-D printer was converted to an optical microscope equipped with a customized, 3-D printed holder for a USB microscope. Precision measurements were determined to have an average error of 10 ?m at the maximum speed and 27 ?m at the minimum recorded speed. Accuracy tests yielded an error of 0.15%. The machine is a true 3-D stage and thus able to operate with USB microscopes or conventional desktop microscopes. Because it is larger than all current commercial alternative systems, it is capable of high depth images over unprecedented areas and complex geometries. The repeatibility is below 2-D microscope stages, but testing shows that it is adequate for the majority of scientific applications. The open source microscope stage costs less than 3% to 9% of the closest proprietary commercial stages. This extreme affordability vastly improves accessibility for 3-D microscopy throughout the world.

AB Crowdsourcing is an innovative business practice of obtaining needed services, ideas, or content or even funds by soliciting contributions from a large group of people (the 'Crowd'). The potential benefits of utilizing crowdsourcing in product design are well-documented, but little research exists on what are the barriers and opportunities in adopting crowdsourcing in new product development (NPD) of manufacturing SMEs. In order to answer the above questions, a Proof of Market study is carried out on crowdsourcing-based product design under an Innovate UK funded Smart project, which aims at identifying the needs, challenges and future development opportunities associated with adopting crowdsourcing strategies for NPD. The research findings from this study are reported here and can be used to guide future development of crowdsourcing-based collaborative design methods and tools and provide some practical references for industry to adopt this new and emerging collaborative design method in their business.

AB To compare the value of inversion recovery with on-resonant water suppression (IRON) to conventional T1-weighted (T1w) MRA and computed tomography angiography (CTA) for visualization of peripheral nitinol stents. We visualized 14 different peripheral nitinol stents in vitro both using Gadolinium (Gd) and ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron nanoparticles (USPIOs) for conventional T1w and IRON-MRA using clinical grade 1.5T MR scanner and iodinated contrast material for CTA using a 256-slice CT scanner. Parameter assessment included signal- and contrast-to-noise ratio (S/CNR), relative in-stent signal and artificial lumen narrowing. X-ray angiography served as gold standard for diameter assessment. Gd-enhanced IRON-MRA exhibited highest in-stent SNR and CNR values compared to conventional T1w MRA (IRON (Gd/USPIO): SNR = 30 +/- 3/21 +/- 2, CNR = 23 +/- 2/14 +/- 1; T1w: SNR = 16 +/- 1/14 +/- 2, CNR = 12 +/- 1/10 +/- 1, all p < 0.05). Furthermore, IRON-MRA achieved highest relative in-stent signal both using Gd and USPIO (IRON (Gd/USPIO): 121 +/- 8 %/103 +/- 6 %; T1w: 73 +/- 2 %/66 +/- 4 %; CTA: 84 +/- 6 %, all p < 0.05). However, artificial lumen narrowing appeared similar in all imaging protocols (IRON (Gd/USPIO): 21 +/- 3 %/21 +/- 2 %; T1w: 16 +/- 4 %/17 +/- 3 %; CTA: 19 +/- 2 %, all p = NS). Finally, IRON-MRA provided improvement of the in-stent lumen visualization with an 'open-close-open' design, which revealed a complete in-stent signal loss in T1w MRA. IRON-MRA improves in-stent visualization in vitro compared to conventional T1w MRA and CTA. In light of the in vitro results with Gd-enhanced IRON-MRA, the clinical implementation of such an approach appears promising.

AB The development of techniques for the rapid analysis of N-glycans is a key step in enabling the roles of glycoproteins in biological processes to be studied. Analysis is usually performed through the liberation of the carbohydrate moieties from proteins, followed by fluorescent labeling and identification using either standardized HPLC or mass spectrometry techniques. A simple and robust automated process for the release and isolation of N-glycans would greatly improve analytical throughput and reproducibility, and is thus highly desirable. Inspired by the increasing number of reported projects involving open source labware, which allows the design and construction of otherwise inaccessible laboratory equipment using low-cost 3D printers, we used this technique to fabricate a platform for the automated isolation of N-glycans. As a proof of concept, we demonstrated the successful recovery of glycan samples from the glycoprotein model fetuin using our self-made 3D-printed equipment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Nearly every practical improvement in modeling human motion is well founded in a properly designed collection of data or datasets. These datasets must be made publicly available for the community could validate and accept them. It is reasonable to concede that a collective, guided enterprise could serve to devise solid and substantial datasets, as a result of a collaborative effort, in the same sense as the open software community does. In this way datasets could be complemented, extended and expanded in size with, for example, more individuals, samples and human actions. For this to be possible some commitments must be made by the collaborators, being one of them sharing the same data acquisition platform. In this paper, we offer an affordable open source hardware and software platform based on inertial wearable sensors in a way that several groups could cooperate in the construction of datasets through common software suitable for collaboration. Some experimental results about the throughput of the overall system are reported showing the feasibility of acquiring data from up to 6 sensors with a sampling frequency no less than 118 Hz. Also, a proof-of-concept dataset is provided comprising sampled data from 12 subjects suitable for gait analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A number of physical factors can adversely affect cultural heritage. Therefore, monitoring parameters involved in the deterioration process, principally temperature and relative humidity, is useful for preventive conservation. In this study, a total of 15 microclimate stations using open source hardware were developed and stationed at the Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba, which is registered with UNESCO for its outstanding universal value, to assess the behavior of interior temperature and relative humidity in relation to exterior weather conditions, public hours and interior design. Long-term monitoring of these parameters is of interest in terms of preservation and reducing the costs of future conservation strategies. Results from monitoring are presented to demonstrate the usefulness of this system.

   Reversible Embedding
SO ACS BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE & ENGINEERING

DT Article
DE 3D printing; PDMS; FRE printing; freeform fabrication; Carbopol
AB Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer is used in a wide range of biomaterial applications including microfluidics, cell culture substrates, flexible electronics, and medical devices. However, it has proved challenging to 3D print PDMS in complex structures due to its low elastic modulus and need for support during the printing process. Here we demonstrate the 3D printing of hydrophobic PDMS prepolymer resins within a hydrophilic Carbopol gel support via freeform reversible embedding (FRE). In the FRE printing process, the Carbopol support acts as a Bingham plastic that yields and fluidizes when the syringe tip of the 3D printer moves through it, but acts as a solid for the PDMS extruded within it. This, in combination with the immiscibility of hydrophobic PDMS in the hydrophilic Carbopol, confines the PDMS prepolymer within the support for curing times up to 72 h while maintaining dimensional stability. After printing and curing, the Carbopol support gel releases the embedded PDMS prints by using phosphate buffered saline solution to reduce the Carbopol yield stress. As proof-of-concept, we used Sylgard 184 PDMS to 3D print linear and helical filaments via continuous extrusion and cylindrical and helical tubes via layer-by-layer fabrication. Importantly, we show that the 3D printed tubes were manifold and perfusable. The results demonstrate that hydrophobic polymers with low viscosity and long cure times can be 3D printed using a hydrophilic support, expanding the range of biomaterials that can be used in additive manufacturing. Further, by implementing the technology using low cost open-source hardware and software tools, the FRE printing technique can be rapidly implemented for research applications.

AB Real-time Ethernet (RTE) is widely recognized for its potential to provide a unified communication backbone for next-generation heterogeneous distributed systems. However, most of the existing research in RTE technologies has traditionally focused on formal models and theoretical analyzes of timing properties, usually omitting the associated implementation challenges for testing them in practice. This gap between theory and practice prevents experimental validation of the claimed properties, which in turn hinders the pace of innovation and adoption of the technology in industrial settings. This paper aims at narrowing the theory-practice gap by characterizing a comprehensive open-source RTE framework that explores emerging challenges in real-time networking, including the provision of ultra-low latency and jitter, dynamic bandwidth management, and segmentation within large networks. This work integrates research on formal abstractions for dynamic time-division multiple access arbitration and technological insights from modern hardware infrastructure, and uses a representative distributed video processing application to provide reproducible evidence of the achieved properties in multihop Ethernet settings. By leveraging readily available technology and an open-source design, the proposed framework facilitates further exploration and experimental validation of properties that are beyond the scope of current commercial technologies, encouraging evidence-based discussions to accelerate development and adoption of new standards for next-generation industrial networks.

AB Mesoscale electromechanical systems find applications in fields such as medical instrumentation, soft robotics, microscopy, flexible electronics and imagining. This paper implements the printed circuit MEMS (PC-MEMS) process [1] for the fabrication of a 'pop-up' flexure-based mesoscale system that exploits the simplicity of 2-D manufacturing techniques such as sheet-metal operations and laser cutting to realize a 3-D mechanism. The fabrication of a laminated Delta robot with prismatic actuation is presented to exemplify this process. A working device with actuation and functional components such as linear guides, stepper motors and limit switches is designed and fully realized. Because the mechanism is popped out of the plane to achieve its 3D shape, we present a stiffness analysis to arrive at the out-of-plane (or 'pop-out') angles that the planar system must accommodate so that constraints/limits on actuator torque/force can be can satisfied while producing an operational system. The simplicity of the processes makes it a candidate for the use in the emerging open-source hardware technologies for fabricating low-cost, complex, electromechanical systems.

AB Large-scale high-throughput plant phenotyping (sometimes called phenomics) is becoming increasingly important in plant biology and agriculture and is essential to cutting-edge plant breeding and management approaches needed to meet the food and fuel needs for the next century. Currently, the application of these approaches is severely limited by the availability of appropriate instrumentation and by the ability to communicate experimental protocols, results and analyses. To address these issues, we have developed a low-cost, yet sophisticated open-source scientific instrument designed to enable communities of researchers, plant breeders, educators, farmers and citizen scientists to collect high-quality field data on a large scale. The MultispeQ provides measurements in the field or laboratory of both, environmental conditions (light intensity and quality, temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, time and location) and useful plant phenotypes, including photosynthetic parameters-photosystem II quantum yield (FII), non-photochemical exciton quenching (NPQ), photosystem II photoinhibition, light-driven proton translocation and thylakoid proton motive force, regulation of the chloroplast ATP synthase and potentially many others-and leaf chlorophyll and other pigments. Plant phenotype data are transmitted from the MultispeQ to mobile devices, laptops or desktop computers together with key metadata that gets saved to the PhotosynQ platform (https://photosynq.org) and provides a suite of web-based tools for sharing, visualization, filtering, dissemination and analyses. We present validation experiments, comparing MultispeQ results with established platforms, and show that it can be usefully deployed in both laboratory and field settings. We present evidence that MultispeQ can be used by communities of researchers to rapidly measure, store and analyse multiple environmental and plant properties, allowing for deeper understanding of the complex interactions between plants and their environment.

AB The use of lasers to weld polymer sheets provides a means of highly-adaptive and custom additive manufacturing for a wide array of industrial, medical, and end user/consumer applications. This paper provides an open source design for a laser polymer welding system, which can be fabricated with low-cost fused filament fabrication and off-the-shelf mechanical and electrical parts. The system is controlled with free and open source software and firmware. The operation of the machine is validated and the performance of the system is quantified for the mechanical properties (peak load) and weld width of linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) lap welds manufactured with the system as a function of linear energy density. The results provide incident laser power and machine parameters that enable both dual (two layers) and multilayer (three layers while welding only two sheets) polymer welded systems. The application of these parameter sets provides users of the open source laser polymer welder with the fundamental requirements to produce mechanically stable LLDPE multi-layer welded products, such as heat exchangers.

AB The advent of massively interconnected objects, devices, and sensors raises equally substantial challenges regarding the resources that will allow makers to manage the complexity of such systems and to exploit the opportunities such technologies open up. Simplicity in management and a smooth, creative integration of everyday life objects empowered by digital technology in our own environment are two key factors for a successful penetration of Internet of Things (IoT). We present UDOO IoT, a combined set of open hardware (UDOO Quad, Blu and Bricks) and open software (UAPPI, an extension of MIT App Inventor) technologies that allow novices from their early steps in the maker's world to create their own digital objects connected to the cloud, easily defining custom behavior logic for sensors and actuators. UDOO IoT is illustrated through one of the field studies carried out along its design process.

AB The open design of disc brake and its location close to the road surface may lead the road particles of various sizes and shapes to enter in between brake pads and disc rotor. This study presents an experimental approach to determine the particle shape effect on friction and wear characteristics of OEM disc brake under different operating condition. Two types of external particles which are road particles and silica sand with two range of size of 200 mu m and 400 mu m were used. Testing was conducted for variable load and sliding speed. Presence of external particle with various size and shape affect the wear rate, friction coefficient and surface topography of the brake pad. Smaller particle generated more wear. Moreover, the particles which have sharped shape or high angularity resulted in higher weight loss of the pad and contribute to greater formation of compacted wear debris. Wear rate and friction coefficient also increase with contact pressure.

AB The commercial data acquisition systems used for seismic exploration are usually expensive equipment. In this work, a low cost data acquisition system (Geophonino) has been developed for recording seismic signals from a vertical geophone. The signal goes first through an instrumentation amplifier, INA155, which is suitable for low amplitude signals like the seismic noise, and an anti-aliasing filter based on the MAX7404 switched-capacitor filter. After that, the amplified and filtered signal is digitized and processed by Arduino Due and registered in an SD memory card. Geophonino is configured for continuous registering, where the sampling frequency, the amplitude gain and the registering time are user-defined. The complete prototype is an open source and open hardware system. It has been tested by comparing the registered signals with the ones obtained through different commercial data recording systems and different kind of geophones. The obtained results show good correlation between the tested measurements, presenting Geophonino as a low-cost alternative system for seismic data recording. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Scattering experiments are fundamental for structure analysis of matter on molecular, atomic and sub-atomic length scales. In contrast, it is not standard to demonstrate optical scattering experiments on the undergraduate level beyond simple diffraction gratings. We present an inexpensive Mie scattering setup manufactured with 3D printing and open hardware. The experiment can be used to determine the particle size in dilute monodisperse colloidal suspensions with surprisingly high accuracy and is, thus, suitable to demonstrate relations between scattering measurements and microscopic properties of particles within undergraduate lab course projects.

AB The miniaturization, sophistication, proliferation, and accessibility of technologies are enabling the capture of more and previously inaccessible phenomena in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, more information has not translated into a greater understanding of disease complexity to satisfy diagnostic and therapeutic needs. Challenges include noncompatible technology platforms, the need for wide-scale and long-term deployment of sensor technology (among vulnerable elderly patients in particular), and the gap between the big data acquired with sensitive measurement technologies and their limited clinical application. Major opportunities could be realized if new technologies are developed as part of open-source and/or open-hardware platforms that enable multichannel data capture sensitive to the broad range of motor and nonmotor problems that characterize PD and are adaptable into self-adjusting, individualized treatment delivery systems. The International Parkinson and Movement Disorders Society Task Force on Technology is entrusted to convene engineers, clinicians, researchers, and patients to promote the development of integrated measurement and closed-loop therapeutic systems with high patient adherence that also serve to (1) encourage the adoption of clinico-pathophysiologic phenotyping and early detection of critical disease milestones, (2) enhance the tailoring of symptomatic therapy, (3) improve subgroup targeting of patients for future testing of disease-modifying treatments, and (4) identify objective biomarkers to improve the longitudinal tracking of impairments in clinical care and research. This article summarizes the work carried out by the task force toward identifying challenges and opportunities in the development of technologies with potential for improving the clinical management and the quality of life of individuals with PD.

ID MANIPULATION
AB The maker movement has shown how off-the-shelf devices can be combined to perform operations that, until recently, required expensive specialized equipment. Applying this philosophy to microfluidic devices can play a fundamental role in disseminating these technologies outside specialist labs and into industrial use. Here we show how nanoliter droplets can be manipulated using a commercial DVD writer, interfaced with an Arduino electronic controller. We couple the optical setup with a droplet generation and manipulation device based on the "confinement gradients" approach. This device uses regions of different depths to generate and transport the droplets, which further simplifies the operation and reduces the need for precise flow control. The use of robust consumer electronics, combined with open source hardware, leads to a great reduction in the price of the device, as well as its footprint, without reducing its performance compared with the laboratory setup.

ID VELOCITY ANALYTICAL ULTRACENTRIFUGATION; SEDIMENTATION EQUILIBRIUM;
   PROTEIN INTERACTIONS; QUANTITATION; PRECISION; ACCURACY; DENSITY; SIZE
AB Analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) is a classical technique of physical biochemistry providing information on size, shape, and interactions of macromolecules from the analysis of their migration in centrifugal fields while free in solution. A key mechanical element in AUC is the centerpiece, a component of the sample cell assembly that is mounted between the optical windows to allow imaging and to seal the sample solution column against high vacuum while exposed to gravitational forces in excess of 300,000 g. For sedimentation velocity it needs to be precisely sector-shaped to allow unimpeded radial macromolecular migration. During the history of AUC a great variety of centerpiece designs have been developed for different types of experiments. Here, we report that centerpieces can now be readily fabricated by 3D printing at low cost, from a variety of materials, and with customized designs. The new centerpieces can exhibit sufficient mechanical stability to withstand the gravitational forces at the highest rotor speeds and be sufficiently precise for sedimentation equilibrium and sedimentation velocity experiments. Sedimentation velocity experiments with bovine serum albumin as a reference molecule in 3D printed centerpieces with standard double-sector design result in sedimentation boundaries virtually indistinguishable from those in commercial double-sector epoxy centerpieces, with sedimentation coefficients well within the range of published values. The statistical error of the measurement is slightly above that obtained with commercial epoxy, but still below 1%. Facilitated by modern open-source design and fabrication paradigms, we believe 3D printed centerpieces and AUC accessories can spawn a variety of improvements in AUC experimental design, efficiency and resource allocation.

AB Wireless Sensor and Actuators Networks (WSANs) constitute one of the most challenging technologies with tremendous socio-economic impact for the next decade. Functionally and energy optimized hardware systems and development tools maybe is the most critical facet of this technology for the achievement of such prospects. Especially, in the area of agriculture, where the hostile operating environment comes to add to the general technological and technical issues, reliable and robust WSAN systems are mandatory. This paper focuses on the hardware design architectures of the WSANs for real-world agricultural applications. It presents the available alternatives in hardware design and identifies their difficulties and problems for real-life implementations. The paper introduces SensoTube, a new WSAN hardware architecture, which is proposed as a solution to the various existing design constraints of WSANs. The establishment of the proposed architecture is based, firstly on an abstraction approach in the functional requirements context, and secondly, on the standardization of the subsystems connectivity, in order to allow for an open, expandable, flexible, reconfigurable, energy optimized, reliable and robust hardware system. The SensoTube implementation reference model together with its encapsulation design and installation are analyzed and presented in details. Furthermore, as a proof of concept, certain use cases have been studied in order to demonstrate the benefits of migrating existing designs based on the available open-source hardware platforms to SensoTube architecture.

DE 3D printing; computer-assisted design; prototyping; equipment
AB 3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, is the computer-guided process of fabricating physical objects by depositing successive layers of material. It has transformed manufacturing across virtually every industry, bringing about incredible advances in research and medicine. The rapidly growing consumer market now includes convenient and affordable desktop 3D printers. These are being used in the laboratory to create custom 3D-printed equipment, and a growing community of designers are contributing open-source, cost-effective innovations that can be used by both professionals and enthusiasts. User stories from investigators at the National Institutes of Health and the biomedical research community demonstrate the power of 3D printing to save valuable time and funding. While adoption of 3D printing has been slow in the biosciences to date, the potential is vast. The market predicts that within several years, 3D printers could be commonplace within the home; with so many practical uses for 3D printing, we anticipate that the technology will also play an increasingly important role in the laboratory.

AB The open-source release of self-replicating rapid prototypers (RepRaps) has created a rich opportunity for low-cost distributed digital fabrication of complex 3-D objects such as scientific equipment. For example, 3-D printable reactionware devices offer the opportunity to combine open hardware microfluidic handling with lab-on-a-chip reactionware to radically reduce costs and increase the number and complexity of microfluidic applications. To further drive down the cost while improving the performance of lab-on-a-chip paper-based microfluidic prototyping, this study reports on the development of a RepRap upgrade capable of converting a Prusa Mendel RepRap into a wax 3-D printer for paper-based microfluidic applications. An open-source hardware approach is used to demonstrate a 3-D printable upgrade for the 3-D printer, which combines a heated syringe pump with the RepRap/Arduino 3-D control. The bill of materials, designs, basic assembly, and use instructions are provided, along with a completely free and open-source software tool chain. The open-source hardware device described here accelerates the potential of the nascent field of electrochemical detection combined with paper-based microfluidics by dropping the marginal cost of prototyping to nearly zero while accelerating the turnover between paper-based microfluidic designs.

AB The combination of open-source software and hardware provides technically feasible methods to create low-cost, highly customized scientific research equipment. Open-source 3-D printers have proven useful for fabricating scientific tools. Here the capabilities of an open-source 3-D printer are expanded to become a highly flexible scientific platform. An automated low-cost 3-D motion control platform is presented that has the capacity to perform scientific applications, including (1) 3-D printing of scientific hardware; (2) laboratory auto-stirring, measuring, and probing; (3) automated fluid handling; and (4) shaking and mixing. The open-source 3-D platform not only facilities routine research while radically reducing the cost, but also inspires the creation of a diverse array of custom instruments that can be shared and replicated digitally throughout the world to drive down the cost of research and education further.

ID OPEN-SOURCE HARDWARE; POLYMER; REPRAP; COST
AB Additive manufacturing with 3-D printers may be a key technology enabler for entrepreneurs seeking to use disruptive innovations such as business models utilizing distributed manufacturing. Unlike centralized manufacturing, distributed manufacturing makes the parts and products (the prints) at (or closer to) the source of the demand, cutting out much of the traditional supply chain. Although many expect 3-D printing to take off at the household level and previous work has shown significant returns for those choosing to do so, there are still significant barriers to entry for typical consumers. Our analysis demonstrates that for an individual to make an abnormally high return on their investments in 3-D printers, they must serve others to achieve high utilization rates. The impetus to do so is created by a service that can undercut traditionally manufactured products due to affordability and customizability. Low-cost, open-source 3-D printers are now priced within range of individual entrepreneurs who can take advantage of the long tail of consumers with highly varied interests. The margin advantage, net present value, and return on investment (ROI) analysis provided herein could form the basis of thousands of new small-business ventures in the coming years.

AB This case study explores the opportunities for students of Industrial Design Engineering to engage with direct and indirect stakeholders by making their design process and results into open-ended designed solutions. The reported case study involved 47 students during a two-weeks intensive course on the topic of urban gardening. Observations were collected during three distinctive phases: the co-design phase, the creation of an open design, and the sharing of these design solutions on the online platform Instructables.com.
   The open sharing of local solutions triggered more global discussions, based on several types of feedback: from simple questions to reference to existing works and from suggestions to critiques. Also, some examples of re-appropriation of the designed solutions were reported. These feedbacks show the possibilities for students to have a global vision on their local solutions, confronting them with a wider and more diverse audience.
   The case study shows, on the other hand, the difficulty in keeping students engaged in this global discussion, considering how after a few weeks the online discussions dropped to an almost complete silence. It is also very difficult with such online platforms to follow the re-appropriation cycles, losing the possibility of exploring the new local context where the replication/modification of the designed product occurred. The course's focus on open design is interesting from both the design and educational points of view. It implies a deep change in the teaching approach and learning attitude of students, allowing unknown peers to take part in the design process and fostering a global discussion starting from unique and local solutions.

AB In this work, a new open hardware interface based on Arduino to read electromotive force (emf) from potentiometric detectors is presented. The interface has been fully designed with the open code philosophy and all documentation will be accessible on web. The paper describes a comprehensive project including the electronic design, the firmware loaded on Arduino, and the Java-coded graphical user interface to load data in a computer (PC or Mac) for processing. The prototype was tested by measuring the calibration curve of a detector. As detection element, an active poly(vinyl chloride)based membrane was used, doped with cetyltrimethylammonium dodecylsulphate (CTA(+)-DS-). The experimental measures of emf indicate Nernstian behaviour with the CTA(+) content of test solutions, as it was described in the literature, proving the validity of the developed prototype. A comparative analysis of performance was made by using the same chemical detector but changing the measurement instrumentation. Published by AIP Publishing.

AB The precision and repeatability offered by computer-aided design and computer-numerically controlled techniques in biofabrication processes is quickly becoming an industry standard. However, many hurdles still exist before these techniques can be used in research laboratories for cellular and molecular biology applications. Extrusion-based bioprinting systems have been characterized by high development costs, injector clogging, difficulty achieving small cell number deposits, decreased cell viability, and altered cell function post-printing. To circumvent the high-price barrier to entry of conventional bioprinters, we designed and 3D printed components for the adaptation of an inexpensive 'off-the-shelf' commercially available 3D printer. We also demonstrate via goal based computer simulations that the needle geometries of conventional commercially standardized, 'luer-lock' syringe-needle systems cause many of the issues plaguing conventional bioprinters. To address these performance limitations we optimized flow within several microneedle geometries, which revealed a short tapered injector design with minimal cylindrical needle length was ideal to minimize cell strain and accretion. We then experimentally quantified these geometries using pulled glass microcapillary pipettes and our modified, low-cost 3D printer. This systems performance validated our models exhibiting: reduced clogging, single cell print resolution, and maintenance of cell viability without the use of a sacrificial vehicle. Using this system we show the successful printing of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into Geltrex and note their retention of a pluripotent state 7 d post printing. We also show embryoid body differentiation of hiPSC by injection into differentiation conducive environments, wherein we observed continuous growth, emergence of various evaginations, and post-printing gene expression indicative of the presence of all three germ layers. These data demonstrate an accessible open-source 3D bioprinter capable of serving the needs of any laboratory interested in 3D cellular interactions and tissue engineering.

AB Supporting learners affectively while carrying out stressful educational activities is an open research issue. It requires the appropriate infrastructure for recognizing emotional states and reacting accordingly in runtime. In this paper, we describe the open platform that we have implemented (named AICARP v2) to detect changes in physiological signals that can be associated with stressful situations, and when this happens, it recommends the learner to relax by delivering modulated sensorial support in terms of light, sound, or vibration at a relaxation breath rate. In this way, by taking advantage of ambient intelligence, the learner can perceive the recommended action without interrupting the learning activity (in this case, practicing the oral exam of a second language). The signal acquisition of the system (which combines sensors from Libellium e-Health platform with others integrated ad hoc) has been compared with a commercial system (J&J Engineering I-330-C2), obtaining similar outcomes as to identifying significant changes in the physiological signals when the learner experiments an emotional reaction. However, the cost of AICARP v2 is much lower, and at the same time, it is open hardware and flexible and, thus, has the advantage of providing runtime data processing. User studies have served to evaluate participants' perception of the sensorial support, as well as to calibrate the delivery rule and to evaluate the effectiveness of the support provided to them.

AB Smart meters are an enabling technology for many smart grid applications. This paper introduces a design for a low-cost smart meter system as well as explaining fundamentals of smart metering. The smart meter platform, provided as open hardware, is designed with a connector interface compatible to the Arduino platform, thus opening the possibilities for smart meters with flexible hardware and computation features, starting from low-cost 8 bitmicro controllers up to powerful single board computers that can run Linux. The metering platform features a current transformer which allows a non-intrusive installation of the current measurement unit. The suggested design can switch loads, offers a variable sampling frequency, and provides measurement data such as active power, reactive and apparent power. Results indicate that measurement accuracy and resolution of the proposed metering platform are sufficient for a range of different applications and loads from a few watts up to 5 kW.

AB C-arm cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) offers CT-like 3D imaging capabilities while being appropriate for interventional suites. 3D images are reconstructed based on 2D projections gathered during the rotation of the C-arm around the object under investigation. It is mandatory to provide accurate geometrical projection parameters for each acquired 2D image, otherwise significant CT artifacts may be induced in the reconstructed 3D volume. Usually, a pre-calibration (offline calibration) using an X-ray phantom is preformed under the assumption that the C-arm motion is reproducible. Thereby, stochastic misalignments due to the open design of mobile C-arm CBCT systems are not considered. In this article we introduce a novel online calibration algorithm to compensate stochastic mechanical inaccuracies. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on simulated and real data.

SO ARTHROSCOPY TECHNIQUES

DT Article
ID FRACTURES; FIXATION
AB Open reduction internal fixation of proximal humerus fractures is often accomplished with proximal humerus locking plates. While these plates have a good track record, they can become symptomatic and require removal once the fracture has healed. Open hardware removal is associated with a number of additional risks to the patient, including infection, scarring, nerve damage, and blood loss. In addition, the recovery time after open hardware removal may be prolonged, thereby predisposing the patient to postoperative stiffness. The purpose of this article is to describe a technique for removing proximal humerus locking plates arthroscopically. Although technically demanding, the benefits of this technique include smaller incisions, quicker recovery time, decreased risk of infection, and reduced blood loss. Arthroscopy also provides the surgeon with the ability to address concomitant intra-articular pathology at the time of surgery. Additionally, we use a bone-void filler to reduce the risk of fracture through stress caused by previous screw holes.

AB The need for automated analyzers for industrial and environmental samples has triggered the research for new and cost-effective strategies of automation and control of analytical systems. The widespread availability of open-source hardware together with novel analytical methods based on pulsed flows have opened the possibility of implementing standalone automated analytical systems at low cost. Among the areas that can benefit from this approach are the analysis of industrial products and effluents and environmental analysis. In this work, a multi-pumping flow system is proposed for the determination of phosphorus in effluents and polluted water samples. The system employs photometric detection based on the formation of molybdovanadophosphoric acid, and the fluidic circuit is built using three solenoid micropumps. The detection is implemented with a low cost LED-photodiode photometric detection system and the whole system is controlled by an open-source Arduino Uno microcontroller board. The optimization of the timing to ensure the color development and the pumping cycle is discussed for the proposed implementation. Experimental results to evaluate the system behavior are presented verifying a linear relationship between the relative absorbance and the phosphorus concentrations for levels as high as 50 mg L-1.

AB The availability of free and open source hardware designs that can be replicated with low-cost 3D printers provides large values to scientists who need highly-customized low-volume production scientific equipment. Digital manufacturing technologies have only recently become widespread and the return on investment (ROI) was not clear, so funding for open hardware development was historically sparse. This paper clarifies a method for determining an ROI for the development of scientific free and open source hardware (FOSH). By using an open source hardware design that can be manufactured digitally, the relatively minor development costs result in enormous ROIs for the scientific community. A case study is presented of a syringe pump released under open license, which results in ROIs for funders ranging from hundreds to thousands of percent after only a few months. It is clear that policies encouraging FOSH scientific hardware development should be adopted by organizations interested in maximizing return on public investments for science.

AB OpenPET is an open source, modular, extendible, and high-performance platform suitable for multi-channel data acquisition and analysis. Due to the flexibility of the hardware, firmware, and software architectures, the platform is capable of interfacing with a wide variety of detector modules not only in medical imaging but also in homeland security applications. Analog signals from radiation detectors share similar characteristics-a pulse whose area is proportional to the deposited energy and whose leading edge is used to extract a timing signal. As a result, a generic design method of the platform is adopted for the hardware, firmware, and software architectures and implementations. The analog front-end is hosted on a module called a Detector Board, where each board can filter, combine, timestamp, and process multiple channels independently. The processed data is formatted and sent through a backplane bus to a module called Support Board, where 1 Support Board can host up to eight Detector Board modules. The data in the Support Board, coming from 8 Detector Board modules, can be aggregated or correlated (if needed) depending on the algorithm implemented or runtime mode selected. It is then sent out to a computer workstation for further processing. The number of channels (detector modules), to be processed, mandates the overall OpenPET System Configuration, which is designed to handle up to 1,024 channels using 16-channel Detector Boards in the Standard System Configuration and 16,384 channels using 32-channel Detector Boards in the Large System Configuration.

AB The complexity of a particle accelerator implies the remote control of very large numbers of devices, with many different typologies, either distributed along the accelerator or concentrated in locations, often far away from each other. Local and global control systems handle the devices through dedicated communication channels and interfaces. Each controlled device is practically a "smart node" performing a specific task. In addition, very often, those tasks are managed in real-time mode. The performances required to the control interface has an influence on the cost of the distributed nodes as well as on their hardware and software implementation. In large facilities (e.g. CERN) the "smart nodes" derive from specific in-house developments. Alternatively, it is possible to find on the market commercial devices, whose performances (and prices) are spread over a broad range, and spanning from proprietary design (customizable to the user's needs) to open source/design. In this paper, we will describe some applications of smart nodes in the particle accelerators field, with special focus on the power supplies for magnets. In modern accelerators, in fact, magnets and their associated power supplies constitute systems distributed along the accelerator itself, and strongly interfaced with the remote control system as well as with more specific (and often more demanding) orbit/trajectory feedback systems. We will give examples of actual systems, installed and operational on two light sources, Elettra and FERMI, located in the Elettra Research Center in Trieste, Italy.

AB This article considers the practice of hacking in terms of making and modifying three-dimensional objects. In line with the work of a number of prominent thinkers in the field, the practice is considered to be a deliberate act by end users to not only understand, make accessible, de-alienate, appropriate and personalise products but also to demystify what Latour refers to as the black box' effect of established product archetypes. Where hacking is typically considered a post-production process, it is argued here that upfront, design-led approaches intended to harness downstream end-user post-production hacking (pre-hack) are in line with Jones' call from over three decades ago for design divergence and continuity through collaborative processes - which we now find in the field of Open Design. This is discussed in light of the broader context of sustainability, which needs innovation from the ground up as well as top down.

   ABSTRACT Objective The current study aimed to compare the Philadelphia collar and an open-design cervical collar with regard to user satisfaction and cervical range of motion in asymptomatic adults.
   Design Seventy-two healthy subjects (36 women, 36 men) aged 18 to 29 yrs were recruited for this study. Neck movements, including active flexion, extension, right/left lateral flexion, and right/left axial rotation, were assessed in each subject under three conditionswithout wearing a collar and while wearing two different cervical collarsusing a dual digital inclinometer. Subject satisfaction was assessed using a five-item self-administered questionnaire.
   Results Both Philadelphia and open-design collars significantly reduced cervical motions (P < 0.05). Compared with the Philadelphia collar, the open-design collar more greatly reduced cervical motions in three planes and the differences were statistically significant except for limiting flexion. Satisfaction scores for Philadelphia and open-design collars were 15.89 (3.87) and 19.94 (3.11), respectively.
   Conclusion Based on the data of the 72 subjects presented in this study, the open-design collar adequately immobilized the cervical spine as a semirigid collar and was considered cosmetically acceptable, at least for subjects aged younger than 30 yrs.

ID MODEL
AB Due to the low cost of easy-to-use components of open-source hardware and software, the Internet of Things may be pervading through everything everywhere. The dependability of the Internet of Things is critical because the services will be concerned with real life. However, the inexpensive hardware provides limited resources for communication. In this paper, we present exact all-terminal reliability of the wireless networks of which the number of links of each node is bounded. First, we analyze the all-terminal reliability of the regular wireless network, where any two nodes are connected by a wireless link consisting of a pair of radio modules. The reliability polynomial is derived from the Tutte polynomial that is the seminal work of the algebraic graph theory. Second, we analyze the all-terminal reliability of the wireless network including the random mesh network under the assumption that if the module fails, all radio links connected through a radio module are cut off. We consider both the fault of the communication module and the fading of the wireless channel in the indoor channel condition. For improving the reliability, we also propose a fault-tolerant method giving redundant radio modules into each node. We also analyze cost-effectiveness. We also calculate the mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) for wireless networks. We show that the random mesh network of which each node includes three or more the radio-broadcast modules is more dependable than any other regular network of which each node comprises four point-to-point modules if it is the connected graph in the static environment.

AB Objectives
   Deprescribing has been proposed as a way to reduce polypharmacy in frail older people. We aimed to reduce the number of medicines consumed by people living in residential aged care facilities (RACF). Secondary objectives were to explore the effect of deprescribing on survival, falls, fractures, hospital admissions, cognitive, physical, and bowel function, quality of life, and sleep.
   Methods
   Ninety-five people aged over 65 years living in four RACF in rural mid-west Western Australia were randomised in an open study. The intervention group (n = 47) received a deprescribing intervention, the planned cessation of non-beneficial medicines. The control group (n = 48) received usual care. Participants were monitored for twelve months from randomisation. Primary outcome was change in the mean number of unique regular medicines. All outcomes were assessed at baseline, six, and twelve months.
   Results
   Study participants had a mean age of 84.3 +/- 6.9 years and 52% were female. Intervention group participants consumed 9.6 +/- 5.0 and control group participants consumed 9.5 +/- 3.6 unique regular medicines at baseline. Of the 348 medicines targeted for deprescribing (7.4 +/- 3.8 per person, 78% of regular medicines), 207 medicines (4.4 +/- 3.4 per person, 59% of targeted medicines) were successfully discontinued. The mean change in number of regular medicines at 12 months was -1.9 +/- 4.1 in intervention group participants and +0.1 +/- 3.5 in control group participants (estimated difference 2.0 +/- 0.9, 95% CI 0.08, 3.8, p = 0.04). Twelve intervention participants and 19 control participants died within 12 months of randomisation (26% versus 40% mortality, p = 0.16, HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.22) There were no significant differences between groups in other secondary outcomes. The main limitations of this study were the open design and small participant numbers.
   Conclusions
   Deprescribing reduced the number of regular medicines consumed by frail older people living in residential care with no significant adverse effects on survival or other clinical outcomes.

AB The deformation monitoring of structures and buildings is an important task field of modern engineering surveying, ensuring the standing and reliability of supervised objects over a long period. Several commercial hardware and software solutions for the realization of such monitoring measurements are available on the market. In addition to them, a research team at the University of Applied Sciences in Neubrandenburg (NUAS) is actively developing a software package for monitoring purposes in geodesy and geotechnics, which is distributed under an open source licence and free of charge.
   The task of managing an open source project is well-known in computer science, but it is fairly new in a geodetic context. This paper contributes to that issue by detailing applications, frameworks, and interfaces for the design and implementation of open hardware and software solutions for sensor control, sensor networks, and data management in automatic deformation monitoring. It will be discussed how the development effort of networked applications can be reduced by using free programming tools, cloud computing technologies, and rapid prototyping methods.

   THERAPY; HYPNOTHERAPY; BEHAVIOR; IMAGERY; PTSD
AB Objective > Hypnosis is classically presented as a useful psychotherapy for various psychiatric conditions, especially in the field of stress and anxiety. However, its place in therapeutic of chronic anxiety disorders remains unclear and questioned. Thus, the goal of this systematic review was to analyse the papers reporting clinical data on the efficacy of hypnosis in anxiety disorders.
   Methods > A literature search was conducted on Pubmed to retrieve all original papers, published between 1980 and 2015, reporting clinical information on the efficacy of hypnosis in six categories of anxiety disorders. Each paper has been assessed from a methodological point of view, and the results have been analysed.
   Results > Only three controlled studies have been identified, one in panic disorder and two in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The other papers related open-design studies (4 articles), or single case reports (20 articles). The controlled study conducted in panic disorder suggested that the combination of hypnosis with cognitive-behavior therapy was not an effective strategy, and this negative result was also obtained in one of the studies conducted in PTSD. The third study, including 48 Indonesian children with PTSD, showed a significant improvement with a specific hypnosis technique adapted to the local culture. Other papers related also positive results but in non-controlled studies or in case reports, their conclusions cannot be generalized.
   Conclusion > To date, evidence is negative or insufficient to support the efficacy of hypnosis in chronic anxiety disorders, in any categories whatsoever - including phobia or PTSD. Specific further studies are needed to identify some potential profiles predictive of response to hypnosis in these conditions.

AB A critical parameter to assess the environmental status of water bodies is the transparency of the water, as it is strongly affected by different water quality related components (such as the presence of phytoplankton, organic matter and sediment concentrations). One parameter to assess the water transparency is the diffuse attenuation coefficient. However, the number of subsurface irradiance measurements obtained with conventional instrumentation is relatively low, due to instrument costs and the logistic requirements to provide regular and autonomous observations. In recent years, the citizen science concept has increased the number of environmental observations, both in time and space. The recent technological advances in embedded systems and sensors also enable volunteers (citizens) to create their own devices (known as Do-It-Yourself or DIY technologies). In this paper, a DIY instrument to measure irradiance at different depths and automatically calculate the diffuse attenuation K-d coefficient is presented. The instrument, named KdUINO, is based on an encapsulated low-cost photonic sensor and Arduino (an open-hardware platform for the data acquisition). The whole instrument has been successfully operated and the data validated comparing the KdUINO measurements with the commercial instruments. Workshops have been organized with high school students to validate its feasibility.

AB Environmental data are critical to understanding environmental phenomena, yet their consistent collection and curation can be cost-prohibitive. This paper describes a recipe for the design, development, and deployment of a low-cost environmental data logging and transmission system for environmental sensors and its connection to an open source data-sharing network. The hardware is built using several low-cost, open-source, mass-produced components. The system automatically ingests data into HydroServer, a standards-based server in the open source hydrologic information system (HIS) created by the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Sciences Inc. (CUAHSI). By publishing data in this way, they are discoverable through the geographic information system (GIS)-based CUAHSI tools, HydroDesktop and HydroShare. In addition, because they follow WaterML encoding, open hardware data stored in the HIS can be included in international catalog such as the global earth observation system of system catalog. A recipe for building the system is provided. Multiple deployments used to test proof-of-concept of the system are described and their results are given. Ease of deployment and reliability of the logging and transmission system is also addressed.

ID PERIPHERAL-VISION; MANAGEMENT; FORESIGHT; CHOICE
AB Mass transport systems are vital for big cities and their disruption may have severe consequences for the economy, safety and security of the general public. Thus far, the attacks on mass transport have been about twice as lethal as terrorist attacks overall. Mass transport systems are typically of open design layout with multiple access points, and these characteristics make the process of screening challenging. Therefore, the early identification of an attack plan is the most efficient way to protect such systems. This paper aims to better understand the attack phenomenon and to develop a new approach for the systematic identification of possible weak signals and their sources. If such weak signals can be timely detected and correctly interpreted, this could improve awareness and thus possibilities for intervention. The developed approach is demonstrated by applying it to two well-known but different cases: the Tokyo satin attack of 1995 and the 2005 London bombings. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Several psychosocial, family-focused evidence-based treatments (EBTs) for youth with disruptive behavior have proven effective in practice settings. However, limited research has examined community implementation of EBTs for pediatric depression and bipolar disorder. This pilot open trial evaluated multi-family psychoeducational psychotherapy (MF-PEP) with 41 children ages 7 to 12 (54% male, 92% Caucasian) with mood disorders and their parents in an outpatient setting. MF-PEP is an 8-session, adjunctive EBT with parallel child and parent groups. Fourteen community therapists facilitated 6 MF-PEP groups at 3 agencies over 2 years. Developed checklists were used to evaluate adherence. Clinical outcomes were measured via clinician assessment and self-report questionnaires at pretreatment, posttreatment, 6-month follow-up, and 12-month follow-up, and analyzed via hierarchical linear modeling. Therapist group adherence ranged from 66.71% to 78.68% (M = 72.14%, SD = 4.85). Children experienced significant improvement in depressive and manic symptoms, and parents reported a significant increase in knowledge of mood disorders. Children with bipolar disorder and families with limited treatment history benefitted most from MF-PEP. Effect sizes (Cohen's d) ranged from small to large for mood outcomes (d = 0.34 to 1.18), knowledge (d = 1.02), and treatment beliefs (d = 0.04 to 0.41). Limitations included small sample, missing data, and open design. Results suggest that MF-PEP may be impactful for families affected by pediatric mood disorders in the community, especially among youth with bipolar disorder and families novice to treatment. Randomized controlled trials are needed to provide more definitive evidence for the effectiveness of MF-PEP in practice settings.

AB The smart e-bike monitoring system (SEMS) is a platform for the real-time acquisition of usage data from electrically-assisted bikes (also called pedelecs or e-bikes). It is autonomous (runs off the bike battery), replicable (open source and open hardware), scalable (different fleet sizes) and modular (sensors can be added), so it can be used for further research and development. The system monitors location (global positioning system), rider control data (level of assistance) and other custom sensor input in real time. The SEMS data feeds an online interface for data analysis, for riders to view their own data and for sharing on social media. The basic system can be replicated by other researchers and can be extended with modules to explore various issues in e-bike research. The source code and hardware design are publicly available, under the General Public License, for non-commercial use. SEMS was implemented on 30 bikes and collected data during 10 months of real-word trials in the UK. This study details the design and implementation of the hardware and software, discusses the system use and explores features for future design iterations. The SEMS turns singular e-bikes into a networked fleet and is an example of the internet of things in the cycling context.

AB From a transdisciplinary standpoint, we need to address the environmental, economic, social and cultural dimensions of sustainability by calling attention to the key role of social sciences in working with other experts and in engaging stakeholders. This article is focused on present and potential direct contributions from social scientists in the practical realms of designing, producing and using sustainable technologies, while also arguing that more active interventions are not only desirable, but considerably urgent from start to end in these realms. In addition, we argue that such interventions are now facing promising opportunities with upcoming technological trends that range from open design and new maker cultures to rapid prototyping or digital fabrication. These trends already offer several openness routes in technology creation, and consequently foster wider practical and conceptual transdisciplinary platforms to envision, build and share not only physical objects but also the ideas and discussions that constitute them.

AB Open source hardware has the potential to revolutionise the way we build scientific instruments; with the advent of readily available 3D printers, mechanical designs can now be shared, improved, and replicated faster and more easily than ever before. However, printed parts are typically plastic and often perform poorly compared to traditionally machined mechanisms. We have overcome many of the limitations of 3D printed mechanisms by exploiting the compliance of the plastic to produce a monolithic 3D printed flexure translation stage, capable of sub-micron-scale motion over a range of 8 x 8 x 4 mm. This requires minimal post-print clean-up and can be automated with readily available stepper motors. The resulting plastic composite structure is very stiff and exhibits remarkably low drift, moving less than 20 mu m over the course of a week, without temperature stabilisation. This enables us to construct a miniature microscope with excellent mechanical stability, perfect for time-lapse measurements in situ in an incubator or fume hood. The ease of manufacture lends itself to use in containment facilities where disposability is advantageous and to experiments requiring many microscopes in parallel. High performance mechanisms based on printed flexures need not be limited to microscopy, and we anticipate their use in other devices both within the laboratory and beyond. (C) 2016 Author(s).

AB This paper proposes the use of OSHW to successfully penetrate the Internet of Things (IoT) market by using a social platform with a new interdisciplinary perspective rather than through the use of existing technical approaches. Snowball sampling was used in this study to survey 300 people who work and have had experiences with online brand communities for open source hardware (OSHW) at Fab Lab Seoul. The findings of this study indicate that content, consumer support, user interface, and reward are among the five factors that trigger an online brand community to develop a social OSHW platform. However, this study also found that brand reputation was insignificant relative to activating a social media platform for open-source software. In addition, activating a social platform for OSHW can positively affect to the brand community's loyalty for OSHW, which means that social platform innovation for OSHW can help form the positive attitude necessary to develop and diffuse an OSHW culture in a rapidly changing ICT ecosystem. This can be an important strategy for OSHW business and can contribute to the growth of the IoT market in South Korea. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

An attitude controller is designed based on the robust servomechanism linear quadratic regulator. Sweeping the penalty function weight coefficient provides an optimized controller. Simulation results show that the closed system performs excellently in terms of the time and frequency domain. An open-source hardware is utilized to realize the controller design. Flight experiments depicts that the attitude control satisfies the demand and has an excellent performance.

DE swarm robotics; visual homing; robotics
AB The purpose of this paper is to articulate the need for an open, extensible robot platform to support swarm robotic research using vision and to propose one such platform. The platform proposed here is intended for research which trades smaller population size with more sophisticated individual robot capabilities. The validation of proposed swarm robotic algorithms using real-world hardware is essential, but is fraught with difficulty due to the expense and complexity of developing and maintaining multiple operational units. A number of open hardware platforms have been proposed, although most prioritize small size and low cost over advanced capabilities such as vision. We are interested in a number of different research directions which utilize vision as a core capability and find the existing open hardware platforms to be insufficient (and existing commercial platforms too expensive). In this paper we describe a set of desirable characteristics for an open, extensible visually-guided robot platform. We then present our solution, the BuPiGo (pronounced buppy-go), describing the hardware itself and a model developed for simulation purposes. We also present some initial results on using the BuPiGo for visual homing an individual navigation task that we hope to exploit for swarm tasks in the future.

AB Machines in general and robots in particular, appeal greatly to children and youth. With the widespread availability of low-cost open source hardware and free open source software, robotics has become central to the promotion of STEM education in schools, and active learning at college/university level. With robots, children in developed countries gain from technological immersion, or exposure to the latest technologies and gadgets. Yet, developing countries like India still lag in the use of robots at school and even college level. In this paper, an innovative and low-cost educational outdoor mobile robot is developed for deployment by school children during volunteer trash pickup. The wheeled mobile robot is constructed with inexpensive commercial off-the-shelf components, including single board computer and miscellaneous sensors. It is remote controlled by children using smart phone app or video game controller. The robot is also equipped with air quality sensors to display air pollution levels to the children and public. The project can improve STEM education, environmental literacy and civic engagement among school children, while providing interdisciplinary service learning opportunities for college and university students. Results of a prototype mobile robot design, development, and deployment are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.

AB Electrophysiology has recently evolved into an interactive, high-throughput endeavor. Recording from dozens to hundreds of electrodes is today routine; novel means of manipulating the system in real time, through electrical stimulation, optogenetics or sensory manipulation are allowing us to decipher neural circuit function at an unparalleled rate. To contribute to the wide dissemination of such techniques, we present an open hardware project, High-Channel Count Electrophysiology (HiCCE), aiming to produce low-cost, high-channel count (>= 128 channels) electrophysiology instrumentation capable of fast data acquisition rates, real-time processing and feedback capabilities. Our design is centered on an open standard, FPGA Mezzanine Card (FMC), which permits a varied choice of FPGA carrier architectures suited to different laboratory experimental needs. The HiCCE-128, a low-cost high-performance 128-channel data acquisition board for small voltage signals, is being introduced. It is a FMC module that can be operated from any FPGA carrier conforming to the FMC/VITA57 standard. This specialized board with a low input referred noise of about 3 mu V is capable of acquiring 128 channels simultaneously at 31.25 kS/s per channel with 16 effective bits of resolution. We present the global architecture and some preliminary measurement to illustrate its potential for electrophysiological and medical applications.

AB We have designed and developed a robotic car with simple architecture by assembling open source hardware, Bluetooth module and advanced sensors. We have also developed an android application running on a smart phone which monitors and controls the operation of the robot via Bluetooth and can also access the sensors data. The car is programmed with auto obstacle detection and prevention algorithm based on ultrasonic ranging sensor. For monitoring purpose we have considered only temperature and humidity in the present work. But there is provision to connect other sensors too, viz. explosive detector or nuclear radiation detector based on requirement. The digital one wire temperature and humidity sensors are mounted to monitor real time temperature and humidity of the surrounding medium. The data of these parameters are displayed on the android application running remotely. In addition to this, the car is capable of transmitting live streaming video through an IP based Webcam, which helps in remotely monitoring and controlling the movement. The system has a provision of storing the data and retrieving it from the online database for analysis. In this paper we have discussed the hardware design, software aspects and test results of the system.

AB This paper proposes a methodology for learning of languages programming using open hardware tools. It has chosen as study case, the teaching of Python language due to versatility, structure and robustness that this language provides in the design and construction of hardware and software elements in devices such as Arduino or Raspberry PI. However, this methodology can be employed in the teaching of other type of programming languages such as C, Java, or Dart. It has selected as educational framework of the methodology some sections of the model known as Stage Self Direct Learning (SSDL) which provides a conceptual base that serves as reference model allowing to build a methodology in which the students will be participant of their own educational process. In order to enhance the learning process in the students, in the structure of course, it has designed an e-learning course taking as platform to ILIAS (Integriertes Lern-, Informations-und Arbeitskooperations-System). It is an open source platform with some features such as Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) resources, forums, surveys, taxonomy services, exercises and assessment. During the development of course, different kinds of resources were created and shared through this platform, these were subject to discussion providing a space for the exchange of ideas and experiences associated with the main topics of this course. The methodology established allowed to encourage the interest of the students in the learning and use of programming languages as likewise using them in the design of projects that require the use of open hardware resources.

AB We present our recent work on the electrical and hardware design of the multi-robot mobile platform WeeMiK. The goal of this project was to develop a low-cost and robust but extensible platform for research and educational purpose especially in swarm robotics. WeeMiK structure enables large-scale innovative, new curriculum, multi-agent research and mobile robot outreach to artificial intelligent students. We introduce WeeMiK platform, which offers a balance between capabilities, accessibility, cost and an open-design with open source programing SDK. All of electrical structure include sensors, motor drive, wireless communication system and device communication manager (DCM), are designed based on a 8-Bit AVR micro-controller that runs under Real-Time Operating System (freeRTOS) with tasks scheduling. With a range of different sensors like inertia navigation system (INS), IR ring for both transceiver data besides proximity, wireless communication and omnidirectional locomotion system, not only WeeMiK can interact with environment in multiple ways, but it also able to communicate with the other WeeMiKs and or PC, therefore it can be used in various swarm robotic scenarios. We demonstrate the usability of our concept by quantifying the obstacle avoidance task and also briefly describe the software design based on Arduino and freeRTOS framework for educational usage.

AB Cyber-Physical Production System (CPSS) and Service Provisioning are two inevitable trends and challenges for factories of the future. Existing literature in the Internet of Things (IoT) landscape detail opportunities and difficulties, but performance data to evaluate the overheads and suitability of services provisioning for industrial applications is not readily available. So, we designed and developed a General Telematic Framework for Rapid Application Development using Service-Oriented Architectural (SOA) principles and then provisioned services used in typical CPSS environments on embedded Raspberry Pi hardware modules. Performance profiling demonstrates the suitability for Industry-grade CPSS applications. Other applications such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicle search and rescue, Vehicular Tracking, and distributed management systems are also possible with OSGi-based, embedded telematics system.

The proposed Raspberry Pi-Arduino-based model architecture ensures lower cost while allowing some scalability, inter operability, portability and interchangeability to the low-cost online laboratory. Remotely controlled lab provides training skills in bio-inspired robotics. Our previous studies had shown that the implementation of remotely controlled online labs in the curriculum improved active learning among students, collaboration, and augmented problem solving skills. The preliminary implementation involved proprietary software, as the remote experiment accessibility platform, which was later replaced with FOSS technology. The advantages with FOSS included a significantly lower cost and se:liability for concurrent usage. The paper also reports on usage analysis and common issues in both cases of implementations.

AB Technical progress in production technology, the advancement and spread of information and communication technologies (ICT) as well as the spill-over of the highly efficient and innovative open source principles to the world of physical products represent a new set of tools and concepts to address the challenges of sustainable economic development. Correspondingly, we can observe (new) modes of value creation that put into question traditional economic strategies and assumptions by stressing collaboration instead of competition and knowledge sharing instead of black box engineering. Open Source Ecology (OSE) is a famous example of a nonprofit organization which fosters worldwide participation and collaboration to jointly develop open source hardware for operation in both developing and industrialized countries. Based on the concepts open source appropriate technology (OSAT), the community aims at the free access to the knowledge and knowhow of low-cost and easy-to-build products to empower people to build and run a civilization. This case study describes and analyzes the value creation processes of OSE and derives new opportunities for business models based on openness.

The authors defined such activities as "ICT DIY" with the hopes of spreading and disseminating DIY culture, that will, in turn, further popularize the ICT-based maker ecosystem. In this sense, the authors have developed a number of ICT DIY standards since 2014 to provide guidance to makers especially nonprofessionals. We have also and had open discussions with international experts to share best practices and raise awareness on ICT DIY in ITU-T. In this paper, the empirical impact of ICT DIY standards towards the actual industry in South Korea is studied and analyzed. The analysis is followed by the discussion of the relationship between ICT DIY and IoT, and the general requirements for how ICT DIY can act as a facilitator to realize the hyper-connected society. The authors concluded by providing implications of the development of ICT DIY and its future impacts.

AB The growing availability of robotic platforms and open-source software presents a striking opportunity for the advancement of scientific instrumentation. Multirotors are particularly versatile platforms which offer some clear advantages for marine-based research missions including mapping and surveying of coastal, glacial, or marine features, photogrammetry, remote atmospheric or water sample collection, specimen tracking, and rare-event monitoring. The Olin College Intelligent Vehicle Laboratory has been actively developing on multirotor platforms to autonomously perform these missions, with special focus on photogrammetric and breath condensate sample collection from cetaceans.
   A critical part of our work is the design of an intelligent controller which will allow the multirotor to land on the deck of a research vessel or vessel of opportunity following the completion of a mission. A central control computer that may be located on the vessel will call the multirotor to return to the research vessel's deck, which has continued to travel during the mission. A global positioning system (GPS) attached to a specialized platform on the deck of the boat provides the current position of the landing platform to the multirotor. Once the multirotor arrives above the perceived location of the landing platform, a downward facing camera mounted onto the vehicle is used to identify a fiducial element that is located on the platform. Using the fiducial element and known state of the vehicle, a visual surveying methodology is used to allow the vehicle to land accurately on the specialized landing platform.
   Unlike in most simulated or controlled environments, the deck of a vessel of opportunity can move unpredictably in 5 axes (roll, pitch, yaw, longitudinal, latitudinal) due to oceanic characteristics and weather conditions. At present, trained multirotor pilots are the standard for controlling air vehicles, especially under these conditions. The scalability, risk, and cost of using a highly skilled human pilot limits the usefulness of these platforms in large-scale research missions. We are aiming to minimize the cost and risk associated with these platforms by making them accessible to untrained pilots as well as allowing for use of multiple platforms at one time and allowing for easy design of missions that the vehicle can conduct semi-supervised.
   Beyond obvious physical changes to the multirotor, including reinforcing structures or waterproofing, the multirotor itself must behave adaptively and sensitively to its environment. Our multirotors are equipped with the open hardware/software PixHawk autopilot system, which automatically rejects small environmental disturbances and provides telemetry data, such as GPS position and state of the vehicle which we use for our controller. A camera mounted to a stabilizing gimbal at the nose of the multirotor captures HD images, and a wireless video link transmits these images and the data from the autopilot to the vessel-mounted computer for processing. Our landing platform is also equipped with a GPS and streams information to the central computer.
   Two types of error are calculated by the computer: macro-error and micro-error. Macro-error refers to the gross positions of the landing platform and the vehicle using GPS signals. Microerror refers to the position of the vehicle in reference to the position of the landing platform fiducial element. These are used to determine the appropriate thrust and directional vectors to give to the vehicle to make a successful landing.
   In Spring of 2016, we implemented successful fiducial identification using computer vision techniques which extract vehicle state and image information to determine relative location of the vehicle to a known fiducial. Using this, we have developed a preliminary controller which allows for station-keeping of the vehicle above an identified fiducial on the ground. In the Summer of 2016, we will continue to develop the control scheme for fiducial identification, vehicle navigation, and landing procedure through field tests at locations including Buzzards Bay, Lake Waban, and the Gloucester Harbor.
   Our technology depends upon, and is itself, open-source. This allows for rapid iteration of controller design and means that what we develop can be made widely available to the marineresearch community for immediate use or customization. By putting these powerful tools in the hands of marine researchers, the need for completing missions manually can be eliminated. Landing on a vessel of opportunity is a significant step towards fully autonomous aerial instrumentation for marine-based research.

AB Precision Agriculture in conjunction with Variable Rate Technology aims at increasing productivity while reducing resource usage (water, fertilizers, pesticides and others). Within this context, the farm's management decisions include information from data collected about the crops health development, which need to be gathered in a timely basis. There are several means of obtaining information about the plants health, including manual data collection from sensors installed in the soil and/or its vicinity, mobile sensor systems, for example embedded sensors in UAVs, or aircrafts, or other vehicles, and satellite imagery, to name just a few examples. The adoption of UAVs in such applications has gaining a lot of attention in recent years due to ease of access, low cost and available flight control software. UAV systems may carry several sensors, which include RGB, infrared, multispectral and hyper-spectral cameras. These cameras are respectively more powerful, in terms of data quality, as well as more expensive. The current paper contribution include the platform model, design and characterization of a multispectral camera system made from two low cost, commercial of the shelf cameras that can be integrated in a small UAV. These aforementioned cameras are compatible with open source hardware, namely Raspberry Pi boards, that are used to collect, process and store information.

AB One of the most cost effective ways to make system control (automation) is by using open source hardware and software, in order to be cost oriented besides the price the systems need to be implemented in reasonable time frame and also needs to be reliable and safe. In this paper we will treat and justify the cases of using the Open Source Hardware and Software, in comparison to industry standard Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC). Also we will discuss about the point of system complexity where the cost reduction will not justify the time spend to build the interfacing of sensors, digital and analog I/O for the open source Hardware.

AB The standard requirement for FA Engineers needing to remove components from a board, prior to decapsulation or sample preparation, is shown to be greatly reduced, by the methods discussed here.
   By using a mechanical selected area preparation system with an open-design it is possible to reach all required areas of a large printed circuit board (PCB) or module to prepare a single component 'in situ'. This makes subsequent optical or electrical testing faster and often more convenient to accomplish. Electronic End-pointing and 3D curvature compensation methods can often be used in parallel with sample prep techniques to further improve the consistency and efficacy of the decapsulation and thinning uniformity and final remaining silicon thickness (RST).
   Board level prep eliminates the worry of rework removal of BGA packages and the subsequent risk of damage to the device. Since the entire board is mounted, the contamination is restricted to the die surface and can be kept from the underside ball connections unlike current liquid immersion methods of package thinning or delayering. Since the camera is in line with the abrasion interface, imaging is real time during the entire milling and thinning process.
   Recent advances in automated tilt-table design have meant that a specific component's angular orientation can be optimized for sample preparation. Improved tilt table technology also allows for improved mounting capability for boards of many types and sizes. The paper describes methods for decapsulation, thinning and backside polishing of a part 'in situ' on the polishing machine and allows the system to operate as a probe station for monitoring electrical characteristics while thinning. Considerations for designing board-level workholders are described for boards that that are populated with components on one or even both sides. Using the techniques described, the quality of sample preparation and control is on a par with the processing of single package-level devices.

AB Innovative and quality education for all is a major precondition for smart nations. Children and youth are fascinated by mechanisms, machines and robots. Therefore, robotics using inexpensive open source hardware and software is increasingly being used in innovative STEM education. But, developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America are well behind the curve in the use of robots in schools and colleges. An innovative and extremely affordable robotic system is developed in this paper, whereby school children anywhere can go online and race multiple indoor mobile robots over the Internet. Virtual reality and force feedback are used to make the racing realistic and interactive. Children will be introduced to building their own inexpensive mobile robots using commercial, off-the-shelf components and materials. Advanced learners, e.g., college and university students, can modify and improve the hardware and software for Internet-based teleoperation. The project can be used to introduce or improve robotics education at a low cost among school children, while providing opportunities in service learning for college/university students.

AB This paper is focused in the inclusion of open software tools and standard hardware devices into advanced mobility aids. Its urgency is due to the incorporation need of the numerous advances in mobile robotics to the area of the Assistive Technologies, and more specifically in the field of the so called Intelligent Wheelchairs (IW). In this paper we propose a common core for IWs based both on an open robotic platform and an open and a well extended software for robotics (ROS "Robotic Operating System"). Such an IW core has got a distributed architecture whose processing nodes are linked through a CAN standard bus, which connects the low level control functions based on low cost and highly portable Cortex platforms. This paper describes also the autonomous navigation algorithm developed for the Intelligent Wheelchair by using an Extended Kalman Filter. In the chosen approach the absolute position of the IW (a mobile robot) is estimated using sensor fusion which combines data from two of the sensory systems included in the described open platform: the dead-reckoning system and a visual system based on QR landmarks located on the ceiling. Within this context, the paper demonstrates the potential of the platform proposal in relation to the quick and easy incorporation of recent advances in mobile robotics.

AB Having a shared and accurate sense of time is critical to distributed Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the Internet of Things (IoT). Thanks to decades of research in clock technologies and synchronization protocols, it is now possible to measure and synchronize time across distributed systems with unprecedented accuracy. However, applications have not benefited to the same extent due to limitations of the system services that help manage time, and hardware-OS and OS-application interfaces through which timing information flows to the application. Due to the importance of time awareness in a broad range of emerging applications, running on commodity platforms and operating systems, it is imperative to rethink how time is handled across the system stack. We advocate the adoption of a holistic notion of Quality of Time (QoT) that captures metrics such as resolution, accuracy, and stability. Building on this notion we propose an architecture in which the local perception of time is a controllable operating system primitive with observable uncertainty, and where time synchronization balances applications' timing demands with system resources such as energy and bandwidth. Our architecture features an expressive application programming interface that is centered around the abstraction of a timeline -a virtual temporal coordinate frame that is defined by an application to provide its components with a shared sense of time, with a desired accuracy and resolution. The timeline abstraction enables developers to easily write applications whose activities are choreographed across time and space. Leveraging open source hardware and software components, we have implemented an initial Linux realization of the proposed timeline-driven QoT stack on a standard embedded computing platform. Results from its evaluation are also presented.

ID PERSPECTIVE
AB As the consumer individualization is becoming stronger and the customer demand is changing more frequently, the traditional manufacture-active design pattern cannot meet the demands of the present age. It is widely acknowledged by experts that the individualization can be really realized if the consumer could participate in the product design process. At present, the consumer participation in product design process through Internet is quite prevalent, but the design methodology and theoretical foundation have never been concerned by previous studies. This paper proposes the concept of Open Design and then investigates related design pattern, method and self-organization mechanism to enable efficient implementation of consumer participation. Aiming at the increasingly complexity and variety with random consumer participation, a reference framework of Internet Open Design which based on social network is established to realize self-organization. Meanwhile, a dynamic function model tool and a knowledge fusion method are proposed to enable efficient and effective consumer participation online. The effectiveness of proposed model, theory and method are validated by simulation. This research on the Internet Open Design Pattern, Method and its Self-organization Mechanism extends the current product design methodology. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) vision relies on reliable low-power wireless technologies and a complete standardized protocol stack that brings Internet connectivity to constrained end devices. Currently IEEE802.15.4-2015 TSCH provides reliability over low-power wireless technologies and the IETF has defined a protocol stack that is suitable to constrained devices. Open-source initiatives contributing to the development of network stacks for embedded devices, and the availability of open hardware platforms that facilitate prototyping IIoT applications contributes to the adoption of IIoT technologies.
   To realize the IIoT vision, this demo presents the Open-WSN and OpenMote projects, which provide both an open-source software implementation of the IEEE low-power wireless technologies and the IETF protocol stack, and an open-source hardware platform that meets the requirements to prototype IIoT applications.

AB In this paper, we introduce MagPDK, an open-source process design kit that represents a magnetic tunnel junction fabrication process. Based on the widely known open design kit FreePDK, MagPDK extends it by adding magnetic tunnel junction devices on top of the standard CMOS transistors. The core of this design kit includes physical design verification rules, connectivity and parasitic extraction decks and a set of parametric cells representing variations of the MTJ device. Electrical simulations can be performed by integrating MagPDK with external MTJ compact models. For this purpose, wrappers are provided for three open-source models available in the literature. A basic set of non-volatile standard-cells and memory bit-cells is supplied with the package to illustrate its capabilities. All of the elements in the PDK were developed using de-facto standard formats, such as OpenAccess, LEF and Spice, and can be seamlessly employed within industry-standard digital, analog or mixed-signal design flows. In addition, MagPDK is backward-compatible with any FreePDK-based layout. With MagPDK, which is the only open-source design kit for magnetic processes available to date, we provide a common environment for researchers, circuit designers and EDA developers, so that they can explore the MTJ-based circuit design space not only in the behavioral level, but in the physical implementation level as well.

AB The proliferation of ubiquitous computing has led to the development of various types of sensor devices for human-computer interaction (HCI). However, the availability of developer tools is lacking in comparison with the development of sensor devices. This shortcoming has been partially addressed by the introduction of open source hardware but it is difficult to develop applications using this alone. In this paper, a framework for sensor device application development has been illustrated by using a visual language and interconnections between the PC and target board.

AB This paper proposes a new cost-effective data acquisition system using open-source hardware and Matlab/Simulink. The proposed data acquisition (DAQ) system has features that it uses the framed data protocol based on hex encoding, it can acquire multiple data which are not of the same type at different sample rates, and the system receives data through USB communication or serial communication. The software of the proposed system consists of the firmware of a microcontroller and user-defined Simulink function block. The firmware of a microcontroller is in the form of a header file, and the data acquisition can be easily achieved by calling a few functions defined in the header file. The developed user-defined Simulink block can get multiple data at different sample rates by configuring the GUI parameters appropriately. For implementation of the system, we use the Arch Max, which is the open-source hardware with an ARM Cortex-M4 core, and also use a user-defined c-code S-function of Matlab/Simulink. For the demonstration of the superiority of the implemented system, we compare the proposed system's performance with that of the data acquisition system provided in Matlab/Simulink Instrument Control Toolbox. Finally we illustrate how presented system can be actually used by applying the proposed system to DC motor control.

AB Automated driving may lead to much higher road capacities, combined with increased road safety, increased driver comfort, and lower costs. Although this vision may hold ground in the long run, first a transitional period will take place in which increasing percentages of vehicles with many levels of automation will drive on the world's road networks. This transition poses a fundamental scientific challenge. The models used today to simulate and predict vehicular traffic are not valid to predict emergent properties of traffic flows under increasing amounts of vehicle automation. For example, there is no idea of how drivers of nonautomated vehicles will respond to other drivers reading their morning papers behind the steering wheel or the consequences of such interactions on traffic safety and capacity. In this paper, the authors do not propose a new behavioral theory with which the effects of increasing vehicle automation can be predicted. What the authors propose is an advanced open-source simulation framework, OpenTrafficSim, which makes it possible to extend microscopic models incrementally with explanatory mental models, such that new behavioral theories can be tested and shared within the community. Given the societal importance of predicting the effects on safety and efficiency of vehicle automation, the authors sincerely hope this paper will fuel the discussion on how both open-source and closed-source simulation software can be adapted and made ready for the next generation of traffic simulation models that are needed in the coming decades.

AB Biologically inspired vision systems, such as convolutional networks, have begun to rival humans in some vision tasks. A key difference between such systems and the human visual system is that the latter dedicates most of its resources to a small fraction of the visual field (the fovea), which it moves frequently and rapidly to acquire a series of rich representations of small parts of a scene. We are developing an artificial system to approximate this aspect of human vision on a robot. The main components are a novel foveating lens, and a novel gimbal that can perform rapid and precise stereo camera orientation. This paper focuses on the gimbal design, which we are releasing under an open hardware license. We expect that it will serve as both an advanced robot vision system, and a source of further insight into human vision.

AB Modern industry requires an improved motor performance and the permanent magnet brushless DC (BLDC) motors are especially appropriate for applications that require a high level of accuracy and performance. The advanced control strategies when applied into BLDC motor drive systems may further enhance their performance. However, these methods are relatively complex and computationally intensive, which may hamper the implementation. Fuzzy logic control algorithm has been developed in this investigation and embedded into a commercially available motion control system for the position control of BLDC motors. BLDC motor drives offered by PicoMotion Inc. and Motion Control Framework software platform have been selected for the experiments due to their compactness, flexibility and the open hardware and software concept they have been created upon. The obtained comparative results with respect to the built in PI control law have confirmed that the implementation of more advanced control strategies on inexpensive hardware and software platforms, nowadays available on the market for the control of BLDC motors, can be practically feasible and can enhance their performance.

AB This paper explains the design and implementation of a low cost Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) system. The system is designed using open source hardware and offthe-shelf components for a cost of below 8 USD. The device identification system makes use of the current-peak signature to uniquely identify devices turned ON at any instance in time. A current sensor is used at the utility service entrance for measuring the current drawn by the devices. The positive current peak data for different devices was used to obtain the devices' current-peak signature. The identification of devices is carried out by the device identification algorithm. An experimental test bench was developed to model, test and validate the system. The system underwent extensive testing for four hundred and twenty man hours over duration of twelve weeks.

AB Power Park comprised of multiple modular microgrids exhibits advantages including: better control flexibility, higher scalability, higher reliability, etc. The energy management system (EMS) of the Power Park can be divided into three layers, namely, converter layer, microgrid module layer and Power Park layer. In order to realize system control objectives in different layers, Beaglebone Black (BBB) is implemented for both microgrid module controller and Power Park Controller. BBB is a low-power open-source hardware single-board computer. Different control algorithms are implemented in each layer to realize respective control objectives. In converter layer control, converter controllers are scheduled to operate based on local information to realize systematic coordination in distributed control. In microgrid module layer, BBB coordinates various converters based on the Field-Area Network (FAN) communication. Functions like secondary voltage/frequency regulation, contingency analysis, etc. are executed to enhance control accuracy within the module. In Power Park layer, Park-Area Network (PAN) is implemented for communication between the central controller and multiple module controllers. Unit Commitment (UC), Economic Dispatch (ED) and Optimal Power Flow (OPF) are executed to schedule the coordination among modules as well as power exchange with utility grid to realize economic optimization.

AB Molded Injection Device (MID) technology enables the fabrication of 3D metalized plastic structures opening a new open design space for antenna applications. Even if in the past years this technology has reached a high degree of process maturity in various industries as well as academic areas, the use of it for macro cellular antenna applications still remain not fully explored. In this work, the use of MID technology for Ultra Wideband (UWB) base-station antenna applications is investigated. Simulation results and measurements show the feasibility of the use of MID in the base station antenna domain in terms of RF-design and performance.

AB In the world of water resource management, commercially available hydroclimatic monitoring systems are large, expensive, and disconnected. The current technology is inaccessible to smaller community groups, citizen scientists, teachers, and even university researchers needing to collect real time or high density data. The HydroSense project aims to build an open-source hardware and software framework to enable hydroclimatic monitoring in a more cost effective manner. At present, several prototype system components have been designed, fabricated, and tested. Our design demonstrates that a complete hydroclimatic monitoring system can be deployed at 1/8th the cost of modern commercially available systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability to interface with existing water quality sensors, allowing stakeholders the ability to use instruments they may already own.

AB As power grids transition from a centralized distribution model to a distributed model, maintaining grid stability requires real-time power quality (PQ) monitoring and visualization. As part of the Open Power Quality (OPQ) project, we designed and deployed a set of open source power quality monitors and an open source cloud-based aggregation and visualization system built with the utility customer in mind. Our aim is to leverage a flexible privacy model combined with inexpensive and easy to use PQ meters in order to deploy a high density power quality monitoring network across the Hawaiian islands. In this paper we describe OPHub, a privacy focused open source PQ visualization along with results of a small scale deployment of our prototype PQ meter across the island of Oahu. Our results demonstrate that OPQ can provide useful power quality data at an order of magnitude less cost than prior approaches.

This paper describes the development of new models for underwater haptic actuation and the ongoing prototype development process necessary for creating this tool. Our objective is to create a system that detects underwater topographies to assist the location of sunken objects in flooded areas by sending haptic signals to wearer's fingertips produced by micro-pumps that propel water of varying pressures. This feedback system extends current haptic technologies by providing hybrid actuation including pressure and vibration underwater, while preserving the wearer's natural ability to grasp objects. This technology has many potential applications beyond underwater echo-haptic location, such as new interfaces for virtual reality object simulation in aqueous environments.

AB The electrocardiographic signal (ECG) reflects the electrical behavior of the human heart. The ECG signal is composed by different waveforms: P, Q, R, S and T. The R wave is normally the easiest waveform to identify on the ECG. The R wave is also the component with the highest amplitude and its detection allows the estimation of the heart rate. This paper is devoted to present the design of a digital filter implemented on an open hardware platform called Arduino to detect the R wave of the ECG signal. The filter design is based on the integration of a smooth filter and the first order derivative. The implemented digital filter has been tested using different ECG signals generated by a patient simulator. Finally, this paper shows a positive performance of the implemented filter in tests related to R wave detection even in the presence of unwanted noise components.

AB The professional courses like Engineering education evolves, based on the courses learnt in that four years duration. Computer Science and Engineering discipline comprises the core courses like mathematics, system, database, networks and programming language courses, etc according to ACM standards. The curriculum is designed in such a way that the core courses are related to each other in one or the other way. Since the related core courses are not handled by the same faculty in successive semesters because of instability of staff in the department of many Engineering Colleges, most of the time courses are taught in an isolated way. So the students are unable to correlate the core courses during their studies. Courses like the Mini and Capstone projects require the concept of core courses that time students are unable to use and correlate the concepts in carrying out these courses. This motivates the authors to select connectivity of courses as a topic to write this article. Object Oriented Modeling and Design course is focused on OO design techniques like Class model, State model, Interaction model and the students are studying this course in the final year. The authors conducted two pedagogy activities to model capstone project design through OOMD course. OO design techniques are explored using Unified Modeling Language constructs. First activity focuses on the model design manually and second designing activity is carried out using open source design tools like StarUML, E-Draw etc. to design their capstone project. Assignments considered in OOMD course are based on capstone project design. Using OO design concepts students are able to design system design, layered architecture and component designs for their capstone project and are also capable to provide alternative design solutions. These activities explore the students to use modeling concepts to develop real world applications involved in their project.

AB This paper presents prototype implementation of low-cost, open hardware, static - gesture recognition system. The implemented system has three major components: A Glove and Sensor Unit (GSU) - consisting of a pair of gloves embedded with custom made, low-cost flex and contact sensors, a Primary Supporting Hardware (PSH) that maps change in input values from GSU, a Secondary Supporting Hardware (SSH) that processes the input values and recognizes the gesture accurately. When a gesture is signed, the GSU tracks the change in orientation of the fingers, which results in a change in voltage levels of the sensors. This change is mapped by the PSH and passed on to SSH which comprises of two ATmega328P microcontrollers, one connected to each of the glove. The two microcontrollers are connected in a master-slave configuration and communication between them is facilitated through an XBee module. The performance of this gesture recognition system is evaluated using a data set comprising of 36 unique gestures. These gestures represent a total of 120 gestures that include all gestures across five globally used sign languages. A gesture recognition engine that resides in the master microcontroller processes the input and identifies the gesture. The gesture recognition engine comprises of a two stage selection-elimination embedded intelligence algorithm that is used to enhance the system efficiency from 83.1% to 94.5% without any additional hardware. The cost of the system is USD 30, which the authors believe on commercialization, could be brought under USD 9.

AB Open source hardware (OSHW) has been created by the design movement and is a promising technology as it applies a compatible concept to a variety of components. Also, OSHW is intended to enable anyone to study specific hardware, makes modifications, and share hardware changes with peers. In this paper, we present the sensor interface application of OSHW. To develop embedded systems using the concept of OSHW, we developed and tested a monitoring module based on the Beaglebone Black for a chip inspection system. The developed module can be used in low power monitoring, and can obtain a more flexible sensor interface in the on-line chip fault inspection and isolation process.

AB The deformation monitoring of structures and buildings is an important task field of modern engineering surveying, ensuring the standing and reliability of supervised objects over a long period. Several commercial hardware and software solutions for the realization of such monitoring measurements are available on the market. In addition to them, a research team at the Neubrandenburg University of Applied Sciences (NUAS) is actively developing a software package for monitoring purposes in geodesy and geotechnics, which is distributed under an open source licence and free of charge. The task of managing an open source project is well-known in computer science, but it is fairly new in a geodetic context. This paper contributes to that issue by detailing applications, frameworks, and interfaces for the design and implementation of open hardware and software solutions for sensor control, sensor networks, and data management in automatic deformation monitoring. It will be discussed how the development effort of networked applications can be reduced by using free programming tools, cloud computing technologies, and rapid prototyping methods

AB To distinguish the classes of unknown data, classification is an important technique. If implemented on hardware these techniques provide more accuracy, faster response in real time predictions than any software implementation. Existing hardware implementations are not at all cost effective, and require specific knowledge of hardware platform. In this paper a cost effective implementation of a statistical classifier has been proposed on Raspberry Pi, an open source hardware platform. This proposed implementation provides on board training of the classifier and real time class prediction. Moreover, it does not require knowledge about the hardware platform to classify the data.

AB Firstly, a complex network model of participants in the open source design community OpenIDEO is built, and the network index such as degree and degree distribution of complex network model are analyzed. By clustering analysis based on the network index, participants are divided into three categories, respectively the core users, information dissemination users and ordinary users. In addition, we assume that the proportion and activeness of information transmission users plays a key role for the evolution of the network. Then, by clustering participants of each project and analyzing the performance of each project, the assumption is verified. The study result is helpful to optimize the mechanism construction of the open source design community and to promote the benign development of the community, which lay the foundation of improving the efficiency and quality of group development.

AB Spectrophotometry is a cross-cutting analytical technique, which finds use in disciplines ranging from chemistry to pharmacy, biochemistry, food science and physics. The SpecUP (Spectrophotometer of the University of Pretoria) is an educational spectrophotometer which was developed so that students could build their own instruments from components in a kit, and then utilise it to generate analytically useful results. This initiative allows for institutions to have more spectroscopy equipment available, as the SpecUP costs less than $40 as opposed to similar to$2 000 which is the cost of an entry-level commercial instrument. This is of particular importance in a developing country context, where student numbers are typically high and resources are scarce. In addition, the SpecUP has moving parts and an open design which allows users to understand what is inside the "black box" of commercial instruments and to discover what happens when they adjust components, allowing for active, inquiry-based learning. The SpecUP user network currently spans South Africa, Tunisia, Namibia, Lesotho, Botswana, Kenya, Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Ivory Coast, Egypt, Turkey and Italy.

AB This paper explores Downloadable Assistive Technologies (DAT) and the possibilities as well as the limitations of publishing and fabricating DAT through online 3D printing communities. A design probe was used for this research within the context of Thingiverse, in the form of a 3D printed dog wheelchair design probe - the FiGO Dog Wheelchair. FiGO enabled an exploration of co-customization of tools and processes for DAT, issues of design and communication around modification and personalisation, with several other themes emerging from the research. It is concluded that implementing communication guidelines for publishing DAT on Thingiverse by involving both end users as well as health professionals in the research process is vital to the process of co-fabrication and modification in an open design context.

AB This paper describes the design work being conducted as part of the OutsideTheBox project. Within the time-frame of eight months, we engaged four children with autism in a participatory design process to develop their own smart object. We re-interpreted Future Workshops and Co-operative Inquiry to demonstrate that a) autistic children can lead processes with a deliberately open design brief and b) this leads us to explore design spaces that are un-imaginable for neuro-typical, adult designers. To capture these four design cases, we have developed Design Exposes, a concept that is inspired by annotated portfolios and Actor-Network Theory. We apply this concept to our cases and present four exposes that subsequently allow us to draw out intermediate-level design knowledge about co-creating technology with autistic children. We close by critically reflecting on the design processes as well as our concept of capturing them.

AB Membrane-based water treatment processes often require sophisticated control and monitoring that is not possible through manual operation. Automated regulation of pressure or flux through a membrane is required to minimize membrane fouling, thus maximizing efficiency and lifespan. Myriad automation tools exist, ranging from single purpose-built solutions to numerous linked sensors and hardware controls, all analyzed and controlled though commercially-available proprietary hardware and software. This paper outlines a way to design control systems for membrane-based filtration that utilize open source hardware and software, increasing the flexibility of a system to changing performance requirements while simultaneously minimizing the expense in time and resources to implement the control scheme. The method presented here can reduce the capital requirement for system control by one to two orders of magnitude while enhancing flexibility for system expansion and process sharing.

AB This article discusses perspectives and principles of R. Buckminster Fuller's philosophy and possible implications on the future role of industrial design. The article challenges professional designers and students of design to look at their philosophical basis for design practice. The point of departure is an existentialist question for the design profession. What one should design towards in general terms and what rationale can back up designing in general?
   A literature review introduces Fullers concepts and perspectives followed and also more recent concepts, like Open Desiign. In the second part of the article, contemporary concepts in technology and design practice are discussed and related to Fullers perspectives and predictions.
   Finally, we remind ourselves that the future of our planet (spaceship earth) depends on our actions and dispositions.

AB In order to support the remote training of Mission Critical Operators, a standard interface and interconnection architecture had to be developed. While many others have created schemes for remote operation of equipment, many tend to either be customized to a target hardware, lack the requisite security protocols, or not be scalable. We have created such an architecture, leveraging existing commercial or open source hardware and software, and creating customizations where necessary to integrate the parts into an entire system. The result is an experience that connects students with industrially relevant hardware and software in a manner that approximates an industrial operator involved in remotely troubleshooting or configuring a networked remote resource.

AB There are some data centers that are located far from the main data center for ensuring continuity of company's Information Technology operations in case the main data center encounters a serious downtime especially for companies engaged to work in distributed manner to increase quality-of-service to their customers. Environmental downtime is a significant cost to organizations and makes them unable to do business because what happens in the data center affects everyone. In addition, the amount of electrical energy consumed by data center increases with the amount of computing power installed. One strategy of reducing energy consumption in data centers is to adjust the temperature and humidity data. Installation of physical Information Technology and facilities related to environment on monitoring temperature, humidity, power, flood, smoke, air flow, room entry is the most proactive way to reduce the unnecessary costs of expensive hardware replacement or unplanned downtime and decrease energy consumed by servers. In this paper, we present remote system for monitoring auxiliary data centers implemented using open-source hardware platforms, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and the Gobetwino. The objective of collecting temperature and humidity data allows monitoring server's health and gets alerts if things start to go wrong. When the temperature hits 50 degrees C., the supervisor at remote headquarters would get a SMS, then take appropriate actions that make sense to reduce electrical costs and preserve functionality of servers in auxiliary data centers. The data center environmental monitoring represents a step forward towards addressing awareness monitoring of energy efficiency and data centers located far with ability to receive a notification by email.

AB The inclusion of people with disabilities and their circle of stakeholders in the design and deployment of digital assistive technology is increasingly being recognized as important. The Do-It-Yourself Assistive Technology (DIY-AT) approach investigates methodologies and tools to support accessible making practices. In prior work, we successfully used a DIY-AT approach to develop TalkBox, an open-source direct-selection communication board for those with little or no functional verbal communication. In this paper, we describe a follow-up project in which we use TalkBox as a prototyping platform to facilitate co-design and co-fabrication of DIY-AT. We present results from (1) a workshop in which users with disabilities and their parents/caregivers fabricated their own TalkBoxes, and (2) a collaborative co-design session with a nonverbal child and his mother wherein the potential for TalkBox variants led to novel design decisions. We illustrate the outcome of our process by describing the multi-vocabulary variant called Hot Swappable TalkBox, in which RFID technology is used to afford easy switching among different vocabulary sets.

DE BCI; EEG; Amplifiers Comparison; P300 Speller; Workload Classification
AB Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) are promising communication devices between humans and machines. BCI based on non-invasive neuroimaging techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG) have many applications, however the dissemination of the technology is limited, in part because of the price of the hardware. In this paper we compare side by side two EEG amplifiers, the consumer grade OpenBCI and the medical grade g. tec g. USBamp. For this purpose, we employed an original montage, based on the simultaneous recording of the same set of electrodes. Two set of recordings were performed. During the first experiment a simple adapter with a direct connection between the amplifiers and the electrodes was used. Then, in a second experiment, we attempted to discard any possible interference that one amplifier could cause to the other by adding "ideal" diodes to the adapter. Both spectral and temporal features were tested - the former with a workload monitoring task, the latter with an visual P300 speller task. Overall, the results suggest that the OpenBCI board - or a similar solution based on the Texas Instrument ADS1299 chip - could be an effective alternative to traditional EEG devices. Even though a medical grade equipment still outperforms the OpenBCI, the latter gives very close EEG readings, resulting in practice in a classification accuracy that may be suitable for popularizing BCI uses.

AB Nowadays, many services and applications need to be secured. In this paper we present the design and the initial development of a new security-oriented open hardware and software platform easy to be integrated and capable of hiding significant complexity behind a set of simple high-level APIs. This SoC platform is called SEcube (TM) (Secure Environment cube). It is a single-chip design that embeds three main cores: a highly powerful processor, a Common Criteria certified smartcard, and a flexible FPGA. The SEcube (TM) platform provides several functional entry levels, ranging from the hardware to software APIs amenable to become service-ready in a near future. This way, developers who do not feel comfortable on security aspects can use the easy-to-use API abstraction layer and experience the Cube as a high-security black box. Conversely, security experts can avail of the open source character, and verify, change, or write from scratch the entire system, starting from the elementary low-level blocks.

AB The Internet of Things promises an always-connected future where the objects surrounding us will communicate in order to make our lives easier, more secure, etc. This evolution is a research opportunity as new solutions must be found to problems ranging from network interconnection to data mining. In the networking community, innovative solutions are being developed for the Device Layer of the Internet of Things, which includes the IoT wireless protocols. In order to study their performance, researchers turn more often to real world platforms, commonly designated by the term "testbeds", on which they may implement and test the protocols and algorithms. This is even more important in the Industrial IoT field, where environments are perturbed by industrial systems like automated production systems. In this paper, after a brief presentation of the context of testbeds, we introduce WiNo and OpenWiNo, an open hardware and software framework for fast-prototyping in the field of the Internet of Things. Compared to existing platforms, the solution WiNo+OpenWiNo offers a wide array of Physical layers and easy integration of various sensors as it is developed as part of the Arduino ecosystem. It also allows research teams to easily and quickly deploy their own testbed into real environments.

AB In order to cope with the challenges of sustainability, systematic methods have been developed for improving the ratio between usefulness and environmental impact of products. These necessary efforts are however constrained if the surrounding business model patterns are not challenged at the same time. In this article, open source design (OSD) is presented as a potential concept leading towards alternative and eco-efficient production and consumption patterns. Potential advantages of OSD for environmental sustainability are hypothesized and confronted with the analysis of the environmental friendliness of four open source products. Two synergies between sustainable design and OSD are identified (product modularity and design for local manufacturing) as well as corresponding challenges for further research.

AB Objectives: To compare the analgesic effect of breastfeeding and 30% glucose on pain induced in term newborns during a single painful procedure. Study Design and Setting: We conducted an open design trial, from January to October 2013, at the maternity of the Yaounde Gynaeco-Obstetric and Paediatric Hospital. Patients and Methods: We included healthy term newborns of at least 24 h of life; a heel prick was done, using a 23-gauge syringe, after an analgesic with breastfeeding or 30% glucose. The newborns were divided into two groups by drawing of lots. The pain was evaluated using the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale. Results: Fifty newborns were recruited per group. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) pain scores, during pricking, were 2 (1.5-3.5) and 3 (2.5-4.5), in the groups of breastfeeding and 30% glucose respectively, with a signiicant statistical difference (P < 0.001). We found a median (IQR) pain score of 3 (2.5-4), in newborns weighing between 2500 and 3000 g, against 2 (1-3) in those weighing above 3000 g with a signiicant statistical difference (P = 0.02). Conclusion: The analgesic effect of breastfeeding is greater than that of 30% glucose solution, in newborns undergoing a single painful procedure. Term newborns weighing between 2500 and 3000 g express pain more than those weighing more than 3000 g.

AB In this paper we use a locally developed adaptive watering system as an example of a remote controlled laboratory (RCL) developed with standard open hardware and using libraries taken from the e-lab. This experiment is a particular case that could benefit from a large number of RCLs proposing different water budget strategies, allowing the studies of the best controller algorithm to save water. The water consumption log can be monitored in real-time and served to any user as a distributed remote laboratory with support of a Raspberry PI and a web connection, using an open source Arduino board and custom made shield. The ultimate goal of RCLs will be achieved when anyone can easily publish their own experiment in the WWW.

AB Remote Controlled Laboratories (RLCs) are expanding everywhere and there is a need for an accessible, yet robust and affordable framework to convey private experiments to the Internet based on the "Internet of Things". In this article we shall introduce a framework based on ready available open hardware and software that can be used in schools, or even at home by anyone with elementary programming skills. In a simple way we discuss how to connect a microcontroller capable of handling an experimental apparatus to the Internet based on a Raspberry Pi, and how to connect the latter using the Go-Lab framework. Moreover remote maintenance for this distributed apparatus can be provided on-line namely for update the firmware when needed. An example of an experiment provided within this technology is given showing the possibilities of this approach.

AB We describe an autonomous, fully functional implementation of the BB84 quantum key distribution protocol using open source hardware microcontrollers for the synchronization, communication, key sifting and real-time key generation diagnostics. The quantum bits are prepared in the polarization of weak optical pulses generated with light emitting diodes, and detected using a sole single-photon counter and a temporally multiplexed scheme. The system generates a shared cryptographic key at a rate of 365 bps, with a raw quantum bit error rate of 2.7%. A detailed description of the peripheral electronics for control, driving and communication between stages is released as supplementary material. The device can be built using simple and reliable hardware and it is presented as an alternative for a practical realization of sophisticated, yet accessible quantum key distribution systems.

ID COLLECTIVE INVENTION
AB Intellectual property rights protection is one of the major strategies of publishing, printing, and packaging companies. It strengthens competitive advantages in a highly competitive environment, particularly, in the digital age. New packaging structure, and packaging content and visual design are valuable targets to be protected under IPR mechanisms. Under IPR mechanisms, not only IPR costs are high for R&D but also the high risk being charged with IPR infringement. For small and mid-size design service companies, it is too complicate to treat IPR issues and difficult to reduce IPR costs. Is there any IPR mechanism that small and mid-size design companies could follow to reduce intellectual property costs and the cost of being charged with IPR infringement? "Technology and knowledge sharing" has developed since the last decade of the 20th century. The open-source movement philosophy has developed to several mechanisms, such as, Open Design, Science Commons, and Creative Commons. This paper is focused on "Creative Commons and IP sharing", to discuss the value of IP sharing for design fields. "Increasing marginal utility" is a major economic theory in this paper used to describe what benefits Open Design And Creative Commons could contribute to the design, publishing, printing, and packaging industries. Expert interviews and case studies are major research methods of this article.

DE Android security; Malware; Smartphone
AB Mobile malware performs malicious activities like stealing private information, sending message SMS, reading contacts and can even harm by exploiting data. Malwares are spreading around the world and infecting not only for end users but also for large organizations and service providers. Malware classification is a vital component and works together with malware identification to prepare the right and effective malware antidote. Not only malware classification but also malware characterization is also important to inform the user and install the malware application, because user are not aware to install the several application of their device. Android application requires several permissions to work. An essential step to install an Android application into a mobile device is to allow all permissions requested by the application. An application is being installed; the system prompts a list of permissions requested by the application and asks the user to confirm the installation. Although Google announced that a security check mechanism is applied to each application uploaded to their market, the open design of the Android operating system still allows a user to install any application downloaded from an unsafe source. Nevertheless, the permission list is still the minimal defense for a user to detect whether an application could be harmful. Therefore in my research work, characterization is still needed to be completed. Malware characterization will also be performed to identify different features from the manifest file. The proposed system can be used to improve the efficiency of Android permission system for informing the user about the risks of Android permissions and applications.

AB In this paper, we present a technology assisted flat learning environment, Teaching to Learn (TeatoL), where all participants have dual roles as students and instructors. The main objective of this work is to investigate how peer-to-peer information exchange aids in bridging knowledge gap in a flat-learning environment. We present our TeatoL implementation that was developed to enhance ill-structured problem solving skill along with its assessment. The participants in the learning environment were given an open design problem related to sheet metal forming. A short lecture about 35 minutes (Phase 0) was given and then student teams were asked to make an instructional video (Phase I) describing their approach for solving the open-ended problem. The videos were viewed by peers, using their computers and mobile devices. The students then critiqued and provided feedback on the posted videos (Phase II). The final step of the process had students write short reports on their problem solving approach (Phase III) that was modified based on peer-to-peer interactions. Student learning in all three phases was assessed to understand the effects of different modes of learning in TeatoL. Our findings indicate that TeatoL is an effective flat online learning environment. Correlation analysis suggests that learning gains are dependent on the level of knowledge on the topic for the learning community (class) and the number of meaningful comments provided by peers. The findings from this work can be utilized to develop technology based online peer learning environments to improve learning outcomes through active collaborative learning. Such an environment can be particularly useful for open course delivery.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to design intelligent robots operating in such dynamic environments like the RoboCup Middle-Size League (MSL). In the RoboCup MSL, two teams of five autonomous robots play on an 18- x 12-m field. Equipped with sensors and on-board computers, each robot should be able to perceive the environment, make decision and control itself to play the soccer game autonomously.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents the design of our soccer robots, participating in RoboCup MSL. The mechanical platform, electrical architecture and software framework are discussed separately. The mechanical platform is designed modularly, so easy maintainability is achieved; the electronic architecture is built on industrial standards using PC-based control technique, which results in high robustness and reliability during the intensive and fierce MSL games; the software is developed upon the open-source Robot Operating System (ROS); thus, the advantages of ROS such as modularity, portability and expansibility are inherited.
   Findings - Based on this paper and the open-source hardware and software, the MSL robots can be re-developed easily to participate in the RoboCup MSL. The robots can also be used in other research and education fields, especially for multi-robot systems and distributed artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the main designing ideas proposed in the paper, i.e. using a modular mechanical structure, an industrial electronic system and ROS-based software, provide a common solution for designing general intelligent robots.
   Originality/value - The methodology of the intelligent robot design for highly competitive and dynamic RoboCup MSL environments is proposed.

Qualitative research methods were mainly employed to gather and analyse the data. Work in the open design community is collaborative; it is a symbiosis of interests between profit-making companies and members of the community resulting in win-win situations. A word spin in the title of this paper indicates fast turns in the practices of the open design community. The study also proposes a potential direction for the future development of self-sufficient design and production of artefacts, platforms and services in an almost untouched area of scientific research.

ID MOTIVATION; INCENTIVES; STUDENTS
AB Many senior level capstone design courses encourage students to develop innovative solutions to open design projects from industry partners. Student teams that function at a high level are more likely to develop innovative solutions. Prior researchers have proposed that there are four stages to the development of groups: forming, storming, norming, and performing. It has been seen that students often get "stuck" in the storming stage and only after they coalesce as a team and set common goals (Norming Phase) can they perform at the highest level to achieve said goals (Performing Phase). The research presented in this paper, focuses on two main areas: (1) understanding what motivates undergraduate engineering students when working on design projects and (2) determining the effects of goal alignment interventions on design teams. A study of senior-level mechanical engineering students was conducted to determine if the effects of setting common goals could be quantified. Five of the total eighteen design teams were selected and guided to set common goals during their design project. Each team was composed of four or five mechanical engineering students. It was found that the teams that received "interventions" had an increase in level of performance (p-value = 0.14) and motivation (p-value = 0.19) when compared to teams that were left to their own devices. The main conclusions are summarized as: (1) interventions can be effectively used to explicitly set common goals for the group, (2) interventions have immediate positive effects on the levels of performance and levels of motivation, and (3) a positive correlation between performance and motivation is found.

ID OPTIMIZATION; DESIGN
AB Energy harvesting systems that couple solar panels with supercapacitor buffers offer an attractive option for powering computational systems deployed in field settings, where power infrastructure is inaccessible. Supercapacitors offer a particularly compelling advantage over electrochemical batteries for such settings because of their ability to survive many more charge discharge cycles. We share UR-SolarCap a versatile open source design for such a harvesting system that targets embedded system applications requiring power in the 1-10 W range. Our system is designed for high efficiency and controllability and, importantly, supports auto-wakeup from a state of complete energy depletion. This paper summarizes our design methodology, and the rationale behind our design and configuration decisions. Results from the operation and testing of a system realized with our design demonstrate: 1) an achievable harvester efficiency of 85%; 2) the ability to maintain sustained operation over a two week period when the solar panel and buffer are sized appropriately; and 3) a robust auto-wakeup functionality that resumes system operation upon the availability of harvestable energy after a period in which the system has been forced into a dormant state because of a lack of usable energy. To facilitate the use of the system by researchers exploring embedded system applications in environments that lack a power infrastructure, our designs are available for download as an archive containing design schematics, Printed Circuit Board (PCB) files, firmware code, and a component list for assembly of the system. In addition, a limited number of pre-assembled kits are available upon request.

AB Recent developments in open source hardware and software platforms (Android, Arduino, Linux, OpenCV etc.) have enabled rapid development of previously expensive and sophisticated system within a lower budget and flatter learning curves for developers. Using these platform, we designed and developed a Java-based 3D robotic simulation system, with graph database, which is integrated in online and offline modes with an Android-Arduino based rubbish picking remote control car. The combination of the open source hardware and software system created a flexible and expandable platform for further developments in the future, both in the software and hardware areas, in particular in combination with graph database for artificial intelligence, as well as more sophisticated hardware, such as legged or humanoid robots.

AB Health monitoring is nowadays one of the hottest markets due to the increasing interest in prevention and treatment of physical problems. In this context the development of wearable, wireless, open-source, and nonintrusive sensing solutions is still an open problem. Indeed, most of the existing commercial architectures are closed and provide little flexibility. In this paper, an open hardware architecture for designing a modular wireless sensor node for health monitoring is proposed. By separating the connection and sensing functions in two separate boards, compliant with the IEEE1451 standard, we add plug and play capabilities to analog transducers, while granting at the same time a high level of customization. As an additional contribution of the work, we developed a cosimulation tool which simplifies the physical connection with the hardware devices and provides support for complex systems. Finally, a wireless body area network for fall detection and health monitoring, based on wireless node prototypes realized according to the proposed architecture, is presented as an application scenario.

TI Soldercubes: a self-soldering self-reconfiguring modular robot system
SO AUTONOMOUS ROBOTS
LA English
DT Article
DE Cellular and modular robots; Self-reconfiguration; Design for
   manufacturability
AB Soldercubes are a self-reconfiguring modular robot (MR) system whose modules are light weight, low cost, and designed with manufacturability for large batch production in mind. The frequently cited promises of modular robotics-versatility, robustness, and low cost-assume the availability of large numbers of modules. However, modules in most MR prototypes are large, mechanically complex, expensive, and difficult to manufacture. Soldercubes partially overcome this contradiction through optimizing some components for volume manufacturing processes. With the integration of a soldering connector which weighs only 2 g and has no moving parts, Soldercubes are among the cheapest, lightest and smallest among comparable self-reconfiguring MR systems. This paper describes the Soldercube module design in detail, reports on experiments in a lattice configuration, explores non-lattice applications of the system, and discusses the effects of utilising volume manufacturing processes in module production. All Soldercubes design files are released as open source hardware.

AB This paper summarises progress made towards the radiation hardening of LED emergency luminaires for evacuation and emergency response within the underground areas of the CERN accelerator complex. The objective has been to radiation harden existing Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) emergency luminaires to maximise lighting performance, without compromising IEC 60598-2-22 compliance. A systems level approach has been adopted, leading to the development of a diode bridge based AC/DC power converter. Modified COTS luminaires including this converter design have been irradiated (to 100 kGy TID using a Cobalt-60 source), with results of a subsequent photometric analysis presented. Following encouraging tests results, a reference design for the power converter has been released under the CERN Open Hardware License to encourage manufacturer adoption. The paper concludes with areas of interest for future research in further improving the radiation hardness of LED emergency lighting for accelerators with detailed studies at the component level for high power white LED devices and associated optical components.

The important design considerations for the CubeSat include availability and performance. The essential contribution of this paper is the requirement elicitation and specification of system-wide qualities such as availability, performance, and security using quality attribute scenarios. The effect of using the quality-based scenarios is that it allows more rigorous treatment of non-functional requirements and hence proper selection of an architecture modeling to satisfy these requirements.

This study introduces a design approach for CW-SPM machines for traction application, presenting the new parametric design plane x, b, where x accounts for the rotor on stator radius split and b summarizes the share between copper and iron in the stator. The proposed design method aims at covering the important area of design of PMSMs with flux weakening capability, with a simple methodology. Analytical and finite-element (FEA) models are used jointly. The design flowchart is illustrated and the output designs are validated by FEA. All presented results are obtained through open-source design resources available online.

AB Open Hardware and Free Software have both active communities. Open source software projects have helped many companies launch their products, but that has not happened in the same proportion for hardware. Assistive technology industry is known to be extremely restricted to proprietary solutions, which may lead to slower development cycles as there is a smaller community of device developers. This paper details how an Arduino-based open hardware project can be improved to become an industrial product with the same quality level of existing available devices. The resulting product is scheduled to be released to the public this year and will expand the use of power wheelchairs in Brazil so that people with disabilities have access to such electronic equipment.

AB Acoustic recorders are the primary tool used in marine bioacoustics; however, available devices are either expensive or lack self-calibration capabilities that are critical for high-quality measurements. Moreover, the software used in proprietary designs can be inflexible and may involve unknown processing steps. To address this, we have designed a miniature low-cost yet high-performance acoustic recorder that features open-source hardware and software. Circuitry is included for self-calibration, making it possible to evaluate device performance in situ. Our intention is that the design will develop in conjunction with the needs of the bioacoustics community.

DE WSN teaching; Arduino; sensory platform design; open source
AB Dynamic development of information and communication technologies nowadays lead to arising the new solutions in monitoring and sensing applications. The most significant solution in that area are Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). These networks consist of a large number of small devices, each with different kinds of sensors. Sensor network nodes are arranged near or inside the potentially dangerous environment, which may cause the damage of the node. However, due to the small size and low cost nodes, these networks have a very broad application. The use of the WSN is dependent on the type of application used. Typical applications for this type of network can be: environmental monitoring, detection and tracking of people and vehicles, to detect various types of threats, machine monitoring or even health monitoring.
   The ability of the design and implement of the Wireless Sensor Networks is very important for today's engineers. The subject of the paper is issue related to the way of teaching Wireless Sensor Networks with the use of Arduino open source development board. The review of the learning path, which starts from the design and finishes on the implementation, was made. The advantages of the use of the open source hardware platform as also as open source software were determined. The way of design of Wireless Sensor Network using XBee protocol was explained.

AB This paper describes an open source hardware and software platform devised specifically to allow high school and undergraduate instructors to prepare new laboratory demonstrations and projects for kinematics and dynamics in an easy, affordable and extensible way. The platform consists of a computing portable station with static sensors and a microcontroller based mobile device small sensors embedded. The whole platform rely heavily on wireless technologies so the students could operate the platform with their own tablets or smartphones.
   To meet the open source requirements, all the components comply with open source restrictions and also the design documents and the source code are made publicly available to the education community. Therefore, there is not only an economical sensing alternative to current configurations of laboratories but an extensible system in which new requirements and sensors could be added covering new areas such as electronics, magnetism and thermodynamics. A user friendly web client permits the students to configure and perform measurements using an Internet connected smartphone or any portable computing device in a way that makes possible to the instructor to broaden the type and intensity of experiments.

ID DESIGN
AB Haptic technology has the potential to expand and transform the ways that students can experience a variety of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) topics. Designing kinesthetic haptic devices for educational applications is challenging because of the competing objectives of using low-cost components, making the device robust enough to be handled by students, and the desire to render high fidelity haptic virtual environments. In this paper, we present the evolution of a device called " Hapkit": a low cost, one-degree-of-freedom haptic kit that can be assembled by students. From 2013-2015, different versions of Hapkit were used in courses as a tool to teach haptics, physics, and control. These include a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), two undergraduate courses, a graduate course, and a middle school class. Based on our experience using Hapkit in these educational environments, we evolved the design in terms of its structural materials, drive mechanism, and mechatronic components. Our latest design, Hapkit 3.0, includes several features that allow students to manufacture and assemble a robust and high-fidelity haptic device. First, it uses 3-D printed plastic structural material, which allows the design to be built and customized using readily available tools. Second, the design takes into account the limitations of 3-D printing, such as warping during printing and poor tolerances. This is achieved at a materials cost of approximately US $ 50, which makes it feasible for distribution in classroom and online education settings. The open source design is available at http://hapkit. stanford. edu.

AB Robot development could benefit from reuse of hardware and software components. One of the most successful example is the Robot Operating System (ROS), which aims at supporting robot development and research in robotics by providing a modular and general purpose software framework; yet, at a lower level, i.e., mechanics, electronics, and firmware, component-based robotics is still in its early stages. Moreover, basic functionalities, such as robust odometry and pose tracking, seem to be solved on an ad-hoc basis, while no generic solution can be plugged in a system as an off-the-shelf component. This paper presents two modular tools for the development of robotics applications and how these can be deployed on different robot platforms as off-the-shelf, open hardware and open software, components at the hardware, firmware, and core software levels. A case study based on two mobile platforms is described showing how it is possible to reuse physical components in the building of a mobile robot and provide an off-the-shelf architecture which sports multi-sensor fusion for robust odometry and pose tracking, requiring a fraction of the effort with respect to ad hoc techniques.

AB The definition of an efficient scheduling policy is an important, difficult and open design problem for the implementation of applications based on dynamic dataflow programs for which optimal closed-form solutions do not exist. This paper describes an approach based on the study of the execution of a dynamic dataflow program on a target architecture with different scheduling policies. The method is based on a representation of the execution of a dataflow program with the associated dependencies, and on the cost of using scheduling policy, expressed as a number of conditions that need to be verified to have a successful execution within each partition. The relation between the potential gain of the overall execution satisfying intrinsic data dependencies and the runtime cost of finding an admissible schedule is a key issue to find close-to-optimal solutions for the scheduling problem of dynamic dataflow applications.

AB This work presents Dimitri, an open-software & open-hardware robot torso equipped with modular low cost compliant joints, built to allow advanced research on human-robot interaction, force-aware object manipulation and environment exploration. The robot has 13 DOFs: 4 DOFs with series elastic actuators in each arm, 3 DOFs for roll, pitch and yaw of the waist, and 2 DOFs for head pan and tilt. Our main innovation is in the employment of a polyurethane based compliant spring system attached to conventional robotics servo motors, turning them into low-cost series elastic actuators (SEAs). To demonstrate the robot's capabilities in the context of cognitive robotics research and goal-directed behavior, we successfully employed a multiple timescale recurrent neural network (MTRNN), enabling the robot to reproduce combined prototypical movement patterns previously trained via interactive demonstration.

By that time there were neither research space nor resources available for undergraduate students to practice problem solving by applying theoretical concepts to real life problems. The Laboratorio Experimental was proposed on mid 2013 as a research initiative where students and faculty could engage together in projects powered by low cost open hardware and free software. This article shares the experiences learned by the proponents of the lab after two years of operation.

TI Using an Arduino Seismograph to Raise Awareness of Earthquake Hazard

AB We implemented an educational program, based on the use of free software and low-cost open hardware, to excite high school students' curiosity about seismic-hazard issues and to engage them in the process of learning the best practices of seismic safety. This program was developed in a senior class at the high school Liceo Paschini in Tolmezzo (northeast Italy). The students under the supervision of their physics teacher and seismologists, used an Arduino board, ADXL345 accelerometers, and open-source software to create a low-cost seismometer able to record local strong motion. In this article, we provide a "how-to" (instructional) guide to enable other students to reproduce the experiment. Certain introductory lessons in computer sciences and electronics were required for the students to acquire the necessary skills and to fill gaps in their background knowledge. In addition, lectures by seismologists and specific laboratory activities allowed the class to explore different aspects of the physics of earthquakes, particularly of the seismic waves, and to become familiar with seismic-hazard topics through inquiry-based learning. We believe that this exercise is a good example of how earthquake issues can be taught through a multidisciplinary approach in subjects traditionally covered by scientific and technological disciplines.

AB Selective openness allows a firm to sell a systemic innovation that combines both open and proprietary technologies. Such firm strategies are now common for open source software and other information goods. However, they pose conceptual and practical uncertainties for hardware-focused companies, particularly as research on open hardware has emphasized community rather than firm success. Here we study firm openness in 3D printing, with a case study of how MakerBot Industries leveraged external communities and selective openness become the consumer market leader. After reviewing the literature on systemic innovation and selective openness, we document the proprietary strategies of a dozen startup companies during the first two decades of the 3D printing industry. We contrast this to the open hardware, software and content strategy that MakerBot's founders used to enter and grow the consumer market from 2009 onward. We show how MakerBot shifted to a selectively open, systemic innovation strategy that complemented proprietary hardware and software with open user-generated content from its Thingiverse online community. From this, we suggest the inherent complementarity of selective openness strategies between open and proprietary components, and conclude with predictions as to when and how a startup or incumbent firm will combine open and proprietary elements.

DE Smart buildings; Indoor localization; nodes placement
AB UPDATED-July 14, 2016. Many Smart Building systems, such as indoor localization or occupancy monitoring systems, require the installation of several transmitting and receiving nodes. The quantity and the positioning of these devices heavily affects the accuracy and the total cost of the system, but tools to automate the nodes configuration currently lack. We propose an open-source design tool for the specification of the building floor plan. The tool is able to suggest a near optimal allocation of sensor nodes, depending on hardware characteristics and prices, in order to maximize the coverage area while minimizing the total cost.

We argue that there is a need for HCI research to engage with the whole lifecycle of sharing services, from inception and design to operation and use. In particular, we motivate the need for an open design approach for IoT-enabled sharing services that fosters intelligibility, accountably and control with respect to the mechanisms and algorithms that govern a sharing service.

AB This paper introduces swarm user interfaces, a new class of human-computer interfaces comprised of many autonomous robots that handle both display and interaction. We describe the design of Zooids, an open-source open-hardware platform for developing tabletop swarm interfaces. The platform consists of a collection of custom-designed wheeled micro robots each 2.6 cm in diameter, a radio base-station, a highspeed DLP structured light projector for optical tracking, and a software framework for application development and control. We illustrate the potential of tabletop swarm user interfaces through a set of application scenarios developed with Zooids, and discuss general design considerations unique to swarm user interfaces.

AB This study provides an in-depth investigation into low-cost and no-cost substrate release mechanisms that allow gas metal arc weld 3-D printed ER4043 aluminum and ER70S-6 steel parts to be removed from a reusable print substrate with minimal energy. Aluminum oxide, boron nitride, and titanium nitride coatings were evaluated as possible substrate release agents for aluminum printing. Additionally, the in situ formation of substrate release agents such as intermetallics and oxides were tested for both aluminum and steel printing. Testing was performed with a modified Charpy impact tester to remove 3D printed metal parts from an 1100 aluminum or A36 low carbon steel print substrate to assess the impact energy required for removal. Specimen porosity was measured prior to sectioning and microstructural analysis, hardness traverses were measured across the specimens, and the elastic and shear moduli of the parts were analyzed via ultrasonic methods. All of the employed substrate release mechanisms minimized weld penetration and, in some instances, formed a brittle phase with the print substrate that allowed the specimens to be removed with minimal impact energy. These results thus provide methods with the removal of metal 3-D printed parts from print substrates with no specialized tooling or equipment conducive to distributed manufacturing.

AB To provide process optimization of metal fabricating self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) 3-D printers requires a low-cost sensor and data logger system to measure current (I) and voltage (V) of the gas metal arc welders (GMAW). This paper builds on previous open-source hardware development to provide a real-time measurement of welder I-V where the measuring circuit is connected to two analog inputs of the Arduino that is used to control the 3-D printer itself. Franklin firmware accessed through a web interface that is used to control the printer allows storing the measured values and downloading those stored readings to the user's computer. To test this custom current and voltage monitoring device this study reports on its use on an upgraded all metal RepRap during the printing of aluminum alloy (ER1100, ER4043, ER4943, ER4047, and ER5356). The voltage and current data were analyzed on a per alloy basis and also layer-by-layer in order to evaluate the device's efficacy as a monitoring device for 3-D printing and the results of the integrated design are discussed.

AB We present a robotic platform based on the open source RepRap 3D printer that can print and maintain chemical artificial life in the form of a dynamic, chemical droplet. The robot uses computer vision, a self-organizing map, and a learning program to automatically categorize the behavior of the droplet that it creates. The robot can then use this categorization to autonomously detect the current state of the droplet and respond. The robot is programmed to visually track the droplet and either inject more chemical fuel to sustain a motile state or introduce a new chemical component that results in a state change (e.g., division). Coupling inexpensive open source hardware with sensing and feedback allows for replicable real-time manipulation and monitoring of nonequilibrium systems that would be otherwise tedious, expensive, and error-prone. This system is a first step towards the practical confluence of chemical, artificial intelligence, and robotic approaches to artificial life.

AB The collector ring is a dedicated ring for fast cooling of ions coming from separators at the FAIR project. To accommodate optimal technical solutions, a structure of a magnet lattice was recently reviewed and modified. Consequently, more appropriate technical solutions for the main magnets could be adopted. A general layout and design of the present machine is shown. The demanding extraction schemes have been detailed and open design issues were completed.

AB Electronic systems are not widely used for measuring biological variables in beehives despite the importance that honeybees have for both the environment and humans. A better understanding of bee colonies is needed in order to prevent certain dangers that threaten the bee population. In this study, we have developed an electronic system based on the Arduino Open Hardware platform, to which we have added temperature and humidity sensors to adapt the system to the particular conditions of beehive management. The system has been used to record changes in temperature and humidity inside hives and assess bees' thermoregulation adaptability within colonies in hives with opened-screened bottom boards; an interesting management tool for controlling the harmful Varroa destructor mite as compared to beehives with conventional closed bottom boards. The results revealed that bee colonies were able to thermoregulate in hives with open anti-Varroa bottom boards to the same degree as those in conventional bottom board hives even under winter conditions in a mediterranean climate, thus indicating that there are no additional risks associated with the use of open-screened bottom board models.

AB The article describes the design phase, development and practical application of a low-cost control system for a forced circulation solar plant in an outdoor test cell located near Milan. Such a system provides for the use of an electric pump for the circulation of heat transfer fluid connecting the solar thermal panel to the storage tank. The running plant temperatures are the fundamental parameter to evaluate the system performance such as proper operation, and the control and management system has to consider these parameters. A solar energy-powered wireless-based smart object was developed, able to monitor the running temperatures of a solar thermal system and aimed at moving beyond standard monitoring approaches to achieve a low-cost and customizable device, even in terms of installation in different environmental conditions. To this end, two types of communications were used: the first is a low-cost communication based on the ZigBee protocol used for control purposes, so that it can be customized according to specific needs, while the second is based on a Bluetooth protocol used for data display.

AB Phenotyping has become the rate-limiting step in using large-scale genomic data to understand and improve agricultural crops. Here, the Bellwether Phenotyping Platform for controlled-environment plant growth and automated multimodal phenotyping is described. The system has capacity for 1140 plants, which pass daily through stations to record fluorescence, near-infrared, and visible images. Plant Computer Vision (PlantCV) was developed as open-source, hardware platform-independent software for quantitative image analysis. In a 4-week experiment, wild Setaria viridis and domesticated Setaria italica had fundamentally different temporal responses to water availability. While both lines produced similar levels of biomass under limited water conditions, Setaria viridis maintained the same water-use efficiency under water replete conditions, while Setaria italica shifted to less efficient growth. Overall, the Bellwether Phenotyping Platform and PlantCV software detected significant effects of genotype and environment on height, biomass, water-use efficiency, color, plant architecture, and tissue water status traits. All similar to 79 000 images acquired during the course of the experiment are publicly available.

AB We describe a completely randomizable flow-through outdoor mesocosm for climate change and ecotoxicology studies that was built with inexpensive materials. The 16 raceway tanks allow up to 6x water renewal per hour, avoiding changes in natural abiotic seawater conditions. We use an open-source hardware board (Arduino) that was adapted to control heaters and an innovative CO2 injection system. This system reduced seawater pH up to -0.9 units and increased temperature up to +6 degrees C in three treatments and a control. Treatments can be continuously compared with the control and vary according to diel fluctuations, thus following the diel range observed in the sea. The mesocosm facility also includes an integrated secondary system of 48 aquaria for ecotoxicology studies. We validated the reproducibility and relevance of our experimental system by analyzing the variation of the total DNA of the microbial community extracted from corals in three elevated temperature scenarios during a 40-day experiment. We also present data from temperature, acidification, and copper contamination trials, which allowed continuous, reliable, and consistent treatment manipulations.

SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
LA English
DT Article
AB We demonstrate the additive manufacturing of complex three-dimensional (3D) biological structures using soft protein and polysaccharide hydrogels that are challenging or impossible to create using traditional fabrication approaches. These structures are built by embedding the printed hydrogel within a secondary hydrogel that serves as a temporary, thermoreversible, and biocompatible support. This process, termed freeform reversible embedding of suspended hydrogels, enables 3D printing of hydrated materials with an elastic modulus <500 kPa including alginate, collagen, and fibrin. Computer-aided design models of 3D optical, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging data were 3D printed at a resolution of similar to 200 mm and at low cost by leveraging open-source hardware and software tools. Proof-of-concept structures based on femurs, branched coronary arteries, trabeculated embryonic hearts, and human brains were mechanically robust and recreated complex 3D internal and external anatomical architectures.

AB Today, open source software plays a significant role in information technology and consumer electronics. Open source hardware, which is the free exchange of a product's design information, is gaining popularity as well. Both ideologies are motivated by trading away competition against collaboration. In this paper we suggest the application of the open source movement to space technology. In the focus of our discussion are CubeSats, considered as an ideal playground for the introduction of technological and methodological novelties. We examine the legal background of open source designs and contrast the advantages of open source products for developers and users against closed source products. We then present an open source initiative for CubeSat technologies with the intention to encourage the CubeSat community to move towards open design. (C) 2015 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB We described an open approach to the use of the computing for exploring science and engineering that is not predetermined or prescribed. Rather, its use is intended to be emergent, where change is a byproduct of teachers, children, and their parents learning together, discovering new possibilities, and sharing those discoveries. These open designs-both hardware and software-empower students and the communities in which they live. They are free to shape the tools that they use to experiment and to engage in projects that are authentic in their design. When students and communities are given control over their learning we postulate that they are more effective learners.

AB Precision agriculture combines the use of information and technology to ensure the best agricultural practices. Obtaining real-time non-invasive information to monitor crops or make yield predictions is a challenge. An approach is to use crop yield models in combination with real-time data used as input in such models. It was demonstrated that it is possible to design an accurate system using open source hardware and open systems to record the input for these models and monitor crops. The system presented has two main components: a device that records environmental parameters and a smartphone application (software) that links this device to a data server in order to process and analyse the information. The solution is scalable in terms of the type of sensors used (i.e. temperature and relative humidity of the air or soil), the rate of information retrieval and so on, so it can be used in various scenarios, including environmental or land policy monitoring. Moreover, this open source hardware can be used by a broad variety of users and is an alternative in poor rural areas because of its low cost compared to other solutions. It can enable increased agricultural production and management of the local environment, bringing new agricultural practices to these areas. Furthermore, progress in the use of this type of technology can help to develop new capabilities for growers. Results of calibration tests and measurements to demonstrate the usefulness of this system in precision agriculture are presented. (C) 2015 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An embedded model predictive controller (eMPC) based on the linear MPC module in Statoil Estimation and Prediction Tool for Identification and Control has been developed, and it is intended to facilitate the MPC application on embedded hardware. The control design approach illustrates a viable way of migrating from an industrial PC-based MPC technology to an embedded platform. This work also provides the transformations and the real-time considerations necessary to achieve a functional high-performance predictive controller on a low-cost embedded hardware, with limited computational resources. The eMPC was implemented for rapid prototyping on the Ethernut 5 open-source hardware, and its performance was tested for a simulated process. The concept was tested using a real MPC application developed for a prototype of a new industrial process that requires an advanced embedded multivariable, constraint handling control solution. The results confirm the viability of the embedded MPC design approach. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB From the rising number of hackerspaces to an increase in hardware start-ups, maker culture is envisioned as an enabler of the next industrial revolutiona source of unhindered technological innovation, a revamp of broken economies and educational systems. Drawing from long-term ethnographic research, this article examines how China's makers demarcate Chinese manufacturing as a site of expertise in implementing this vision. China's makers demonstrate that the future of makingif to materialize in the ways currently envisioned by writers, politicians, and scholars of the global tech industryrests on taking seriously the technological and cultural fabrics of professional making outside familiar information technology innovation hubs like Silicon Valley: making-do, mass production, and reuse. I trace back to China's first hackerspace, documenting how a collective of makers began to move away from appropriating Western concepts of openness toward promoting China as source for knowledge, creativity, and innovation. This article demonstrates that when China's makers set up open hardware businesses and articulate a unique culture of hacking with Chinese characteristics, they draw boundaries between the professional making they saw embodied in Chinese industrial production and the hobbyist making embodied in Western histories and cultures of hacking. In so doing, they position China as site of both technological and cultural expertise, intervening in dominant conceptions of computing that split manufacturing and innovation along geographical lines. This article contributes to critical scholarship of innovation and making cultures, technological expertise, and authorship.

AB Nitrate, the most oxidized form of nitrogen, is regulated to protect people and animals from harmful levels as there is a large over abundance due to anthropogenic factors. Widespread field testing for nitrate could begin to address the nitrate pollution problem, however, the Cadmium Reduction Method, the leading certified method to detect and quantify nitrate, demands the use of a toxic heavy metal. An alternative, the recently proposed Environmental Protection Agency Nitrate Reductase Nitrate-Nitrogen Analysis Method, eliminates this problem but requires an expensive proprietary spectrophotometer. The development of an inexpensive portable, handheld photometer will greatly expedite field nitrate analysis to combat pollution. To accomplish this goal, a methodology for the design, development, and technical validation of an improved open-source water testing platform capable of performing Nitrate Reductase Nitrate-Nitrogen Analysis Method. This approach is evaluated for its potential to i) eliminate the need for toxic chemicals in water testing for nitrate and nitrite, ii) reduce the cost of equipment to perform this method for measurement for water quality, and iii) make the method easier to carryout in the field. The device is able to perform as well as commercial proprietary systems for less than 15% of the cost for materials. This allows for greater access to the technology and the new, safer nitrate testing technique.

AB We present a novel approach to developing a vehicle communication platform consisting of a low-cost, open-source hardware for moving vehicle data to a secure server, a Web Application Programming Interface (API) for the provision of third-party services, and an intuitive user dashboard for access control and service distribution. The CloudThink infrastructure promotes the commoditization of vehicle telematics data by facilitating easier, flexible, and more secure access. It enables drivers to confidently share their vehicle information across multiple applications to improve the transportation experience for all stakeholders, as well as to potentially monetize their data. The foundations for an application ecosystem have been developed which, taken together with the fair value for driving data and low barriers to entry, will drive adoption of CloudThink as the standard method for projecting physical vehicles into the cloud. The application space initially consists of a few fundamental and important applications (vehicle tethering and remote diagnostics, road-safety monitoring, and fuel economy analysis) but as CloudThink begins to gain widespread adoption, the multiplexing of applications on the same data structure and set will accelerate its adoption.

This article shows the development and evaluation process of VISIGNET, a prototype open hardware interoperable vital signs monitoring system that captures data of clinical variables from a patient and sends them to a cloud-based service for their remote visualization. The article first presents a synthesis of the system design, which consists of a WBAN that captures data from three sensors, namely heart rate, body temperature, and blood pressure. Then, it explains the WBAN operation and the data transmission process to Xively, a cloud service. Finally, this article shows the findings of the evaluation of the system, analyzing parameters like coverage, the Frame Error Rate (FER), end-to-end delay, and the battery life of the sensors. It also shows the implementation of a case study with 100 patients from two health centers.

AB Background: To evaluate the effectiveness of an experimental intervention based on standard diet recommendations plus free Smartphone application (app) and wearable device for weight loss, compared with the standard diet intervention alone, in primary care patients aged 18 years or older who are overweight or obese.
   Methods/design: Multicentre randomized, controlled clinical trial. Location: Primary health care centres in the city of Tarragona and surrounding areas. Subjects: 70 primary care patients, aged 18 years or older, with body mass index of 25 g/m2 or greater who wish to lose weight. Description of the intervention: 12 months of standard diet recommendations without (n = 35) or with (n = 35) assistance of a free Smartphone app that allows the participant to maintain a record of dietary intake and a bracelet monitor that records physical activity. The outcomes will be weight loss at 12 months (primary outcome), changes in physical activity and cardiometabolic risk factors, frequency of app use, and participant satisfaction after 12 months.
   Discussion: The results of our study will offer evidence of the effectiveness of an intervention using one of the most popular free apps and wearable devices in achieving weight loss among patients who are overweight or obese. If these new technologies are proven effective in our population, they could be readily incorporated into primary care interventions promoting healthy weight.
   The open design and study characteristics make it impossible for the participants and researchers to be blinded to study group assignment. Researchers responsible for data analysis will be blinded to participant allocation.

AB The new open-source quadrotor platform called X4-MaG presented here was developed for academic and research applications. X4-MaG is a small, low-cost open quadrotor of only 307-grammes which offers two levels of controllers providing a manual mode and an automatic mode thanks to powerful Linux-based controller embedded onboard. The experiments presented here show the reliability of the open hardware and software embedded onboard the quadrotor. To estimate the robot s attitude, a quaternion-based complementary filter requiring very few computational resources was developed and implemented on an 8-bit Arduino board. It was also established that the stabilization feedback system based on quaternions tracks the attitude setpoints with precision up to twice greater than a classical cascaded PI controller. The controllers and estimators were designed in the Matlab/Simulink environment and directly implemented onboard the tiny Linux-based autopilot board using a custom made toolbox (RT-MaG toolbox). The autopilot was tested in the brand-new Marseilles Flying Arena with various 3-D flight trajectories and found to be highly accurate with errors of only 0.7cm in hover and less than 3.2cm at 1.2m.s(-1). The X4-MaG quadrotor was able to reach speeds greater than 2m.s(-1) and reject attitude disturbances of 20' within 0.8s.

   DYNAMICS; TOOLBOX; NEURONS; REPLAY; CODE
AB One often-overlooked factor when selecting a platform for large-scale electrophysiology is whether or not a particular data acquisition system is 'open' or 'closed': that is, whether or not the system's schematics and source code are available to end users. Open systems have a reputation for being difficult to acquire, poorly documented, and hard to maintain. With the arrival of more powerful and compact integrated circuits, rapid prototyping services, and web-based tools for collaborative development, these stereotypes must be reconsidered. We discuss some of the reasons why multichannel extracellular electrophysiology could benefit from open-source approaches and describe examples of successful community-driven tool development within this field. In order to promote the adoption of open-source hardware and to reduce the need for redundant development efforts, we advocate a move toward standardized interfaces that connect each element of the data processing pipeline. This will give researchers the flexibility to modify their tools when necessary, while allowing them to continue to benefit from the high-quality products and expertise provided by commercial vendors.

AB Sustainability has become a major concern in many countries and is leading to strict regulations regarding the impact of products and services during their manufacturing, use, and disposal. Power consumption monitoring in manufacturing companies can lead to a reduction of machine tools energy wastes and consequently to lower expenses. To this end, a complete transparency of energy usage among the entire manufacturing facilities is required. Despite the small volume of material processed, micro manufacturing processes are energy intensive and the optimization of energy usage becomes critical for manufacturing sustainability. Electrical discharge machining (EDM) is considered an attractive solution for the manufacturing of microcomponents. In this paper, a low cost and modular data acquisition system, based on open-hardware and open-source software, for online energy consumption monitoring, is presented. The system described is applied for energy efficiency analysis of the micro EDM milling process by using a state of the art commercial machine tool. A number of sensors is connected to the data acquisition system to measure the energy consumption of the main sub-systems of the machine tool, data is recorded through a microcontroller, and sent to the main computer via Wi-Fi for data storage and analysis. Results show that the process efficiency depends on machine parameters but it is always far below 0.01 %. Solutions are suggested to improve the energy efficiency of the machine tool considered in this work.

AB Objective: 3-D printing technologies have the potential to improve both Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education and Career and Technical Education (CTE), as well as integrating these two educational emphases and providing opportunities for cross-curriculum engagement. The objective of this study is to investigate the potential of open-source (OS) technologies in an educational setting, given the combination of economic constraints affecting all educational environments and the ability of OS design to profoundly decrease the cost of technological tools and technological innovation.
   Methods: This paper reports on a 3-day workshop augmented with online instructional and visual tools designed for middle school and high school level educators from a wide array of disciplines (including traditional science, math, and engineering as well as computer, shop, and art). Teachers (n=22) submitted applications to participate in the workshop, the workshop was observed for both evaluation and research, teachers participated in focus groups (n=2) during the workshop in order to discuss their interest in OS 3-D printing technology and its potential role in their classrooms, and teachers completed a voluntary post-workshop survey and responded to follow-up after printers were in the classroom for one year.
   Results: During the workshop teachers built 3-D printers using OS technologies that they were then able to take back to their schools and into their classrooms.
   Conclusion: Through workshops augmented with online instructional and visual tools designed to provide facilitated yet self-directed engagement with a new, relatively unknown, and relatively complex technology, paired teacher teams were able to successfully build and use RepRap 3-D printers based on OS design in just three days. Practice: Here, we discuss both what the teachers learned and what we learned from the teachers regarding the potential for educators to construct OS 3-D printing technologies as a tool of empowering and transformative education.
   Implications: Open-source 3-D printing technologies have the potential to improve education through a sense of empowerment resulting from active participation, as well as through cross-curriculum engagement. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) refers to the quality of the environment in relation to the health and well-being of the occupants. It is a holistic concept, which considers several categories, each related to a specific environmental parameter. This article describes a low-cost and open-source hardware architecture able to detect the indoor variables necessary for the IEQ calculation as an alternative to the traditional hardware used for this purpose. The system consists of some sensors and an Arduino board. One of the key strengths of Arduino is the possibility it affords of loading the script into the board's memory and letting it run without interfacing with computers, thus granting complete independence, portability and accuracy. Recent works have demonstrated that the cost of scientific equipment can be reduced by applying open-source principles to their design using a combination of the Arduino platform and a 3D printer. The evolution of the 3D printer has provided a new means of open design capable of accelerating self-directed development. The proposed nano Environmental Monitoring System (nEMoS) instrument is shown to have good reliability and it provides the foundation for a more critical approach to the use of professional sensors as well as for conceiving new scenarios and potential applications.

The results confirm the design claims, with the device delivering uniform coatings with a constant quality from experiment to experiment. The robustness in combination with the open design allows developing and sharing of matrix deposition and sample preparation protocols between labs. This tool therefore enables researchers to enter the field of MALDI MSI without previous experience in matrix coating.

AB A majority of black carbon (BC) emitted to the atmosphere in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) region is from burning biomass fuel used in traditional, open-design cookstoves. However, BC and particulate matter (PM) household emissions are not well characterized. Household emission information is needed to develop emission profiles to validate regional climate change models and serve as a baseline for assessing the impact of adopting improved stove technology. This paper presents field-based household PM and BC exfiltration (amount exiting) estimates from village homes in rural Nepal that utilize traditional, open-design cookstoves. Use of these stoves resulted in a 26% mean PM exfiltration, ranging from 6% to 58%. This is a significant departure from an 80% estimate cited in previous reports. Furthermore, having a window/door resulted in an 11% increase in exfiltration when an opening was present, while fuel type had a marginally significant impact on emission. Air-exchange rates (AER) were determined with average (95% CI) AER of 12 (10-14) per hour, consistent with previous studies. In addition, BC to PM2.5 mass-ratio composition during cooking was ascertained, with an average (95% CI) of 31% (24-39), agreeing with previous biomass fuel emission composition literature.

ID ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK
AB Determination of moisture content of soil is absolutely crucial and must be performed frequently to assure the quality of construction work. In a view to suppress the limitations and inaccuracies of the existing methods, a new concept is successfully implemented. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and state-of-the-art electronic circuitry are embedded to realize an automatic measurement system based on an open-source computing platform. Moreover, to facilitate user interaction with the system, a sophisticated graphical user interface (GUI) is created. This system, from both the hardware and software perspective, brings new ideas in, not only the moisture content determination test, but in geotechnical engineering laboratory and field instrumentation in terms of accuracy, automation, and machine intelligence. It will be obvious from this work that open-source hardware and software embedded in test equipment can automate the whole test procedure for almost all types of tests in geotechnical engineering using appropriate sensor, and data-acquisition and processing routines. This paper presents the technical know-how of the system setup, hardware, and software development, workflow, and system validation for the determination of moisture content of subgrade soil in two distinct test modes-supervised and unsupervised. This work will demonstrate that, not only the test procedure can be automated, but time optimization is also possible, which results in at least 50 % test time reduction.

AB The RepRap 3D printer development project is a fast growing, open-hardware initiative relying on the input of hobbyist designers. One of its key components is the printer nozzle. The performance and reliability deficiencies of currently available nozzle designs are common topics in the RepRap community, and our own experience with a RepRap 3D printer has identified a need for improvement in a few particular areas. We set out to eliminate melt leakage, improve thermal isolation, and develop a more effective method of nozzle assembly attachment. Here, we review the issues, describe design efforts, and report results.

AB Non-contacting acoustic and ultrasonic measurements are of interest in applications ranging from nondestructive evaluation to rock physics and medical imaging. The fundamental workings of the detector-the interferometer-are easily explained in undergraduate physics courses, but practical implementations are dominated by specialized, and commercial, devices. We present a robust and relatively inexpensive detector, which consists of a heterodyne interferometer and phase locked loop frequency demodulator, as an open-source alternative. We illustrate the broadband capabilities with the detection of ultrasonic waves in a mudstone sample, and low-frequency (100 Hz) vibrations of a piston.

SO Scientific Reports

ID HIPPOCAMPAL-THETA; LOCOMOTION; BEHAVIOR
AB Conventional deep brain stimulation (DBS) applies constant electrical stimulation to specific brain regions to treat neurological disorders. Closed-loop DBS with real-time feedback is gaining attention in recent years, after proved more effective than conventional DBS in terms of pathological symptom control clinically. Here we demonstrate the conceptualization and validation of a closed-loop DBS system using open-source hardware. We used hippocampal theta oscillations as system input, and electrical stimulation in the mesencephalic reticular formation (mRt) as controller output. It is well documented that hippocampal theta oscillations are highly related to locomotion, while electrical stimulation in the mRt induces freezing. We used an Arduino open-source microcontroller between input and output sources. This allowed us to use hippocampal local field potentials (LFPs) to steer electrical stimulation in the mRt. Our results showed that closed-loop DBS significantly suppressed locomotion compared to no stimulation, and required on average only 56% of the stimulation used in open-loop DBS to reach similar effects. The main advantages of open-source hardware include wide selection and availability, high customizability, and affordability. Our open-source closed-loop DBS system is effective, and warrants further research using open-source hardware for closed-loop neuromodulation.

AB What does open source mean for culture? For knowledge? As cultural production has come to be characterized by contribution as well as consumption and as alternative modes of intellectual property transfer challenge the dominant paradigm' that knowledge and information should be protected and monetized, the logic of open sourcing' has extended into many cultural spheres. This article positions openness' as a value that intermediates between re-usable software code, institutional transparency, and expanded opportunities for participation in knowledge production cultures. By observing and analyzing the expansion of openness' from computer software to electronics hardware, we can develop a framework that identifies the tensions between socio-cultural visions of knowledge commons and the realities of governing those commons. This research focuses in particular on the knowledge related to electronics hardware and other material objects governed by open hardware licenses. The insights in this article are valuable for anyone studying open source and peer production processes and the knowledge claims surrounding them.

AB Technology is changing at a rapid rate, opening up new possibilities within the health care domain. Advances such as open source hardware, personal medical devices, and mobile phone apps are creating opportunities for custom-made medical devices and personalized care. However, they also introduce new challenges in balancing the need for regulation (ensuring safety and performance) with the need to innovate flexibly and efficiently. Compared with the emergence of new technologies, health technology design standards and regulations evolve slowly, and therefore, it can be difficult to apply these standards to the latest developments. For example, current regulations may not be suitable for approaches involving open source hardware, an increasingly popular way to create medical devices in the maker community. Medical device standards may not be flexible enough when evaluating the usability of mobile medical devices that can be used in a multitude of different ways, outside of clinical settings. Similarly, while regulatory guidance has been updated to address the proliferation of health-related mobile phone apps, it can be hard to know if and when these regulations apply. In this viewpoint, we present three examples of novel medical technologies to illustrate the types of regulatory issues that arise in the current environment. We also suggest opportunities for support, such as advances in the way we review and monitor medical technologies.

AB Addressing the gap between global open educational resource (OER) proliferation and the slow adoption of OER and open educational practices (OEP) in Australian higher education, this paper focuses on a capacity-building project targeting academics, academic support staff and educational developers. The conception, design, development, piloting and evaluation of an open, online professional development micro course are detailed, highlighting key aspects of the open design and considerations for sharing and reuse across higher education institutions. The open micro course introduces five key OEP concepts through five contemporary curriculum design topics, using knowledge co-creation activities which engage learners in iterative shaping of the course, and generate artefacts for demonstration and recognition of learning. Opportunities for short to longer term capacity-building which leverage the micro course are also discussed, in response to significant shifts underway in higher education funding and professional development priorities.

AB In recent times innovation has become the most important source of value creation and competitiveness. Some authors have described the innovation process as Engineering Innovation. Currently the software is no longer a technology support, hidden and invisible, to become the driver of value-creating process. Consequently, the challenge of software engineering and engineering innovation should be integrated and complement in order creates new ways to create value. To encourage innovation, in addition to understanding tools and practices of the innovation process, the innovation skills are required. These skills can be grouped into: technical, creativity, collaboration, critical thinking, and management. This paper proposes a strategy based on the use of open source hardware and software to address the development of skills to innovate. The strategy is presented by narrating academic experiences. The aim of these experiments is the conception of new technological products.

AB The need for constant monitoring of environmental conditions has produced an increase in the development of wireless sensor networks (WSN). The drive towards smart cities has produced the need for smart sensors to be able to monitor what is happening in our cities. This, combined with the decrease in hardware component prices and the increase in the popularity of open hardware, has favored the deployment of sensor networks based on open hardware. The new trends in Internet Protocol (IP) communication between sensor nodes allow sensor access via the Internet, turning them into smart objects (Internet of Things and Web of Things). Currently, WSNs provide data in different formats. There is a lack of communication protocol standardization, which turns into interoperability issues when connecting different sensor networks or even when connecting different sensor nodes within the same network. This work presents a sensorized platform proposal that adheres to the principles of the Internet of Things and the Web of Things. Wireless sensor nodes were built using open hardware solutions, and communications rely on the HTTP/IP Internet protocols. The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) SensorThings API candidate standard was used as a neutral format to avoid interoperability issues. An environmental WSN developed following the proposed architecture was built as a proof of concept. Details on how to build each node and a study regarding energy concerns are presented.

AB The concept of the Internet of Things is rapidly becoming a reality, with many applications being deployed within industrial and consumer sectors. At the thing' leveldevices and inter-device network communicationthe core technical building blocks are generally the same as those found in wireless sensor network implementations. For the Internet of Things to continue growing, we need more plentiful resources for building intelligent devices and sensor networks. Unfortunately, current commercial devices, e.g., sensor nodes and network gateways, tend to be expensive and proprietary, which presents a barrier to entry and arguably slows down further development. There are, however, an increasing number of open embedded platforms available and also a wide selection of off-the-shelf components that can quickly and easily be built into device and network gateway solutions. The question is whether these solutions measure up to built-for-purpose devices. In the paper, we provide a comparison of existing built-for-purpose devices against open source devices. For comparison, we have also designed and rapidly prototyped a sensor node based on off-the-shelf components. We show that these devices compare favorably to built-for-purpose devices in terms of performance, power and cost. Using open platforms and off-the-shelf components would allow more developers to build intelligent devices and sensor networks, which could result in a better overall development ecosystem, lower barriers to entry and rapid growth in the number of IoT applications.

DE psychiatric unit design; seclusion; restraint; assault
AB Objective: The psychiatric emergency room is a dynamic and sometimes volatile environment. Its design may be an important variable in patient care, but most design decisions are based on models of thought and treatment with a minimal evidence base.
   Background: The concept of open design, increasing access of patients to nursing staff, for inpatient psychiatric units has recently gained widespread acceptance, despite a dearth of empirical data.
   Methods: We examined rates of seclusion and restraint before and after a design change that reduced the openness of the unit in a dedicated emergency psychiatric service in a general university hospital. Quality assurance data regarding the census, occurrence of assaults, and the use of seclusion and restraint were queried. Two independent analyses utilizing a test of proportional data were performed to replicate the findings.
   Results: After placement of a door to restrict patients' access to the waiting area of the unit, the rate of the use of seclusion and restraint went from 0.03 (44/777) to 0.0185 (27/1,514; z = 2.02, p < .04). Replication over a separate time period saw reduction from 0.029 (67/2,277) to 0.018 (44/2,431), z = 2.44, p < .02).
   Conclusion: A design change that reduced the openness of the unit resulted in the reduction of seclusion and restraint.

ID PUPIL CENTER
AB ExpertEyes is a low-cost, open-source package of hardware and software that is designed to provide portable high-definition eyetracking. The project involves several technological innovations, including portability, high-definition video recording, and multiplatform software support. It was designed for challenging recording environments, and all processing is done offline to allow for optimization of parameter estimation. The pupil and corneal reflection are estimated using a novel forward eye model that simultaneously fits both the pupil and the corneal reflection with full ellipses, addressing a common situation in which the corneal reflection sits at the edge of the pupil and therefore breaks the contour of the ellipse. The accuracy and precision of the system are comparable to or better than what is available in commercial eyetracking systems, with a typical accuracy of less than 0.4A degrees and best accuracy below 0.3A degrees, and with a typical precision (SD method) around 0.3A degrees and best precision below 0.2A degrees. Part of the success of the system comes from a high-resolution eye image. The high image quality results from uncasing common digital camcorders and recording directly to SD cards, which avoids the limitations of the analog NTSC format. The software is freely downloadable, and complete hardware plans are available, along with sources for custom parts.

AB The introduction of affordable, consumer-oriented 3-D printers is a milestone in the current "maker movement," which has been heralded as the next industrial revolution. Combined with free and open sharing of detailed design blueprints and accessible development tools, rapid prototypes of complex products can now be assembled in one's own garage-a game-changer reminiscent of the early days of personal computing. At the same time, 3-D printing has also allowed the scientific and engineering community to build the "little things" that help a lab get up and running much faster and easier than ever before.

AB From 2012 to 2016 all teachers of mathematics, in primary through to upper secondary and adult education, in Sweden are to be given the opportunity of receiving state-coordinated professional development (PD), generally involving around one meeting per week for a year. We examine the ways in which this programme and its content are research-based by analysing the design principles of the PD and its content via a review of the underlying documents. We find that the research base for the design of the PD decisions is formulated only partly explicitly in the documentation, as is the case for the content. Nevertheless, the principles still largely conform to internationally recognised research-based models for PD and teacher change. In the discussion we propose that a relatively open design process, involving many stakeholders with knowledge of both theory and practice rather than an analytical examination of previous research, has contributed to the adoption of this format for the PD programme.

ID FREE-STALL; LYING BEHAVIOR; CLEANLINESS; CATTLE; HEALTH
AB Freestall housing for dairy cows was created to reduce the amount of bedding and labor needed to keep stalls clean. However, some aspects of stall design may restrict stall usage by cows. The aim of this study was to assess dairy cow preference and usage of a conventional stall (with a neck rail and metal stall dividers) and an alternative stall design with no neck rail or stall dividers other than a wooden board protruding slightly (8 cm) above the lying surface. In the no-choice phase of the study, 48 cows were randomly assigned to 8 groups (of 6 cows each); groups were alternately allocated to the 2 treatments. Each group was observed for 7 d on one treatment and then switched to the alternate treatment for 7 d. For the choice phase (also 7 d), groups in adjacent pens were merged (to form 4 groups, each with 12 cows) and cows had free access to both treatments within the merged pen. In the no-choice phase, cows spent more time standing with 4 hooves in the alternative versus conventional freestall (0.60 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.05 +/- 0.06 h/d), but stall designs had no effect on time spent lying down (13.2 +/- 0.4 vs. 12.9 +/- 0.4 h/d). In the choice phase, cows spent more time lying down in the conventional freestall (9.4 +/- 0.8 vs. 4.1 +/- 0.8 h/d) and more time standing with all 4 hooves in the alternative stall (0.24 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.02 +/- 0.03 h/d). These results illustrate how different stall design features can affect different types of stall use; the more open design facilitated standing fully in the stall, but the protruding partitions likely made the stall less suitable for lying.

AB We describe a flexible, simple to build, low-cost, and computer-controlled optical mirror actuator system, developed for undergraduate research laboratories. Geared motors for hobby robotics are controlled by an Arduino microcontroller in combination with an H bridge to finely position mirror mount actuators. We present a graphical user interface based on the Python script language. The price of the fully controlled actuator system is only a small fraction of the price of a commercial system. It can be quickly implemented due to the use of open-hardware electronics. We discuss the performance of the system and give an outlook for future expansions and use in advanced optical setups.

AB The aim of this paper is to present the new, innovative teaching approach and tinkering pedagogy towards developing the students skills in STEM domains (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) with aim to the designing the laboratory for radiation detector development. Involving from one side concept of social situatedness and connectedness, and from another the concept of independent, self-directed and self-regulated student learning, the project was based on assembling the mini-lab, Radiation Sensor Board for Arduino, that was originally designed to help people in Japan to measure levels of radiation in their everyday life after the Fukushima accident. As it was reported elsewhere, this product was an example of crowdsourcing. When Libelien designed the Radiation Sensor Board for Waspmote, the idea was simple: with the Arduino platform people will be able to have easily running their own detector at home while on the other hand with Waspmote platform authorities will be able to deploy autonomous sensor networks to send the radiation levels from dangerous areas using wireless sensor platform ZigBee and GPRS technologies. This paper present students developing project where the Sensor Board for Arduino was used as assembling, teaching tool. The Do-It-Yourself and Internet of Things can be used both in educational, and in the research and development purposes. Owning their own mini-lab at their disposal anytime, students worked at their learning speed. It also boosted the interest, confidence of students and highly affected three domains of learning: cognitive domain (activities like instrumentation, modeling, experimentation, data analysis and design, psychomotor domain (activities like manipulating the apparatus, sensory awareness) and affective domain (behavior and attitudes to learn from failure, creativity, collaborative communication, safety and ethics in the laboratory). We show that networking learning, supported by hands-on labs on chip, and an open source electronics prototyping platform as Arduino and Raspberry Pi, give great opportunities for teaching and learning the tinkering and inventing skills, an request we have to deal with it at the University of Montenegro. Such project support exploratory and serendipitous learning. It moved teching from an emphasis simply on linear logic and programmed instruction, towards non-linear, networked, branching, hypertext views of learning, in which connections between knowledge are made and developed. It is based on principle of situated cognition and Vigotskian thought: situatedness, commonality, interdependency and infrastructure where learning is fascinated by an activity. The presented project integrate a Virtual Learning Environment, networking knowledge and student-owned movable laboratory on the chip, where radiation was used as a topic and where electronics was embedded and embodied.

AB In 2015 NASA plans to launch a payload to 280 Km altitude on a sounding rocket from the Wallops Flight Facility. This payload will contain several novel technologies that work together to demonstrate methodologies for space sample return missions and for nanosatellite communications in general. The payload will deploy and test an Exo-Brake, which slows the payload aerodynamically, providing eventual de-orbit and recovery of future ISS samples through a Small Payload Quick Return project. In addition, this flight addresses future Mars mission entry technology, space-to-space communications using the Iridium Short Messaging Service (SMS), GPS tracking, and wireless sensors using the ZigBee protocol. SOAREX-8 is being assembled and tested at Ames Research Center (ARC) and the NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC) is funding sensor and communications work. Open source Arduino technology and software are used for system control. The ZigBee modules used are XBee units that connect analog sensors for temperature, air pressure and acceleration measurement wirelessly to the payload telemetry system. Our team is developing methods for power distribution and module mounting, along with software for sensor integration, data assembly and downlink. We have demonstrated relaying telemetry to the ground using the Iridium satellite constellation on a previous flight, but the upcoming flight will be the first time we integrate useful flight test data from a ZigBee wireless sensor network. Wireless sensor data will measure the aerodynamic efficacy of the Exo-Brake permitting further on-orbit flight tests of improved designs. The Exo-Brake is 5 m(2) in area and will be stored in a container and deployed during ascent once the payload is jettisoned from the launch vehicle. We intend to further refine the hardware and continue testing on balloon launches, future sounding rocket flights and on nanosatellite missions. The use of standards-based and open-source hardware/software has allowed for this project to be completed with a very modest budget and a challenging schedule. There is a wealth of hardware and software available for both the Arduino platform and the XBee, all low-cost or open-source. Along with the Exo-Brake hardware and deployment discussion, this paper will describe in detail the system architecture emphasizing the successful use of open-source hardware and software to minimize effort and cost. Testing procedures, radio frequency interference (RFI) mitigation, success criteria and expected results will also be discussed. The use of Iridium short messaging capability for space-to-space links, standards-based wireless sensor networks, and other innovative communications technology are also presented.

AB Increasing design complexity, skyrocketing fabrication costs for modern digital systems coupled with an unacceptably large number of silicon respins led to growing importance of comprehensive and automated design verification. Akin to software configuration management, it is becoming commonplace to maintain large hardware design code-bases with hardware configuration management tools. A missing piece of crucial technology in this approach is to manage design verification across evolving hardware designs. In this paper, we propose an efficient methodology for automatically localizing design errors across design versions. The proposed technique, EvoDeb, can be easily integrated into a hardware configuration management framework and is scalable for large designs. We demonstrate the efficacy of EvoDeb on a couple of bugs on open-source hardware designs across multiple evolving variants.

AB Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are well suited for both research and teaching. In this paper the architecture for the design of CPS controllers based on free hardware and software is presented. The advantages of this system include its flexibility, its modular structure facilitating concurrent development and its robustness, with easy evolution of existing systems.
   An application case study that highlights the potential of this model is detailed. Low cost modules have been chosen. As they are largely utilized they have a large community of developers and plenty related technical information can be found. They are based on free hardware and operating systems widely available. Modularity allows implementing them on existing systems, allowing easy evolution. Another significant advantage of the proposed model for both research and teaching is that, due to its low cost, it allows building more mobile robots.

AB Wearable robotics is strongly oriented to humans. New applications for wearable robots are encouraged by the lightness and portability of new devices and the progress in human-robot cooperation strategies. In this paper, we propose the different design guidelines to realize a robotic extra-finger for human grasping enhancement. Such guidelines were followed for the realization of three prototypes obtained using rapid prototyping techniques, i.e., a 3D printer and an open hardware development platform. Both fully actuated and under-actuated solutions have been explored. In the proposed wearable design, the robotic extra-finger can be worn as a bracelet in its rest position. The availability of a supplementary finger in the human hand allows to enlarge its workspace, improving grasping and manipulation capabilities. This preliminary work is a first step towards the development of robotic extra-limbs able to increase human workspace and dexterity.

AB Laboratory practices are very important activities in BSc (Bachelor of Science) and MSc (Master of Science) engineering courses involving concepts of Measurement Science, because they give to both undergraduate and graduate students the unique opportunity to verify with hands-on experiences the arguments introduced in theoretical lessons. Today there are truly uncountable different possible hardware/software low cost choices available for University teaching which could be complementary or alternative to the commonly used teaching tools (LabVIEW (R), MATLAB (R), etc.). In effects, the use of open-source and open-hardware platforms can offer different advantages with respect to traditional ones; first, they assure a bottom-up approach, which guarantees a pleasant and constructive learning with a gradual comprehension of concepts from the simple ones to more complex ones. Then, these cheap and readily available platforms permit to verify (also at home) the theoretical concepts and the proposed exercises with low cost devices rather than with expensive ones. Finally, the learning outcomes of the basic courses are indispensable to advanced courses where sensors, wireless networking and embedded systems converge, encouraging students to explore and realize new applications, preparing them for successful careers as engineers.

AB Nowadays embedded systems have reached a great level of maturity and diffusion thanks to their small size, low power consumption, large connectivity and variety of application in everyday contexts. These systems, if properly structured and configured, can significantly increase the smartness of the environments where they are deployed, monitoring and continuously collecting data to be processed and elaborated. Such operations can be correctly executed, especially in large locations, if several embedded systems nodes are deployed under the design of an intelligent network. This paper presents SMuNe, a Smart Multisensor Network based on the BeableBone Black platform, a complete open hardware and software embedded computer; the challenge is to create a multi-purpose hierarchical network composed by smart nodes able to gain and manage heterogeneous data and spaces according to the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. As a proof of the effectiveness of SMuNe we conducted an experimentation within the Cultural Heritage domain; in detail we deployed SMuNe within a sculptures exhibition named "The Beauty or the Truth" in the monumental site of San Domenico Maggiore in Naples, Italy.

AB During a disaster, conventional communications infrastructures are often compromised, which prevents local populations from contacting family, friends, and colleagues. The lack of communication also impedes responder efforts to gather, organize, and disseminate information. This problem is made worse by the unique cost and operational constraints typically associated with the humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) space. In response, we present a low-cost, scalable system that creates a wide-area, best-effort, ad-hoc wireless network for emergency information. The Communication Assistance Technology over Ad-Hoc Networks (CATAN) system embraces the maker and do it yourself (DIY) communities by leveraging open-source and hobbyist technologies to create cheap, lightweight, battery powered nodes that can be deployed quickly for a variety of operations. CATAN enables geographically separated users to share information on standard interfaces, i.e. web and SMS, over commonly-used communication interfaces, i.e. GSM and Wi-Fi. These interfaces enable CATAN to accommodate a variety of digital devices while leveraging the global ubiquity of cellular devices. By emphasizing simple, mature, technologies, CATAN avoids many problems that hinder many general purpose ad-hoc technologies. We have tested our infrastructure in a variety of environments and have open-sourced the entire project to encourage collaboration with the greater HADR community.

AB The design and implementation of Smart Grids takes usually into account the participation of LV electrical energy consumers (through techniques such as Demand Response). However, there is still a lack of cost effective hardware and software solutions that would allow these consumers to monitor their installation, comprehend their electrical energy consumption, take action towards achieving energy efficiency, and effectively participate in Demand Response programs. This paper aims to address this issue, presenting a complete, open source hardware and software solution, which enables measurements of electrical voltages and currents at the installation main distribution panel, the transmission and storage of the respective data in a personal computer, and their subsequent processing by the Cassandra open source software platform. The analysis of the proposed solution components is followed by results obtained by the implementation in a residential installation.

An experimental system was designed for the optimization of the parallel manipulator control based on a selected optimal configuration. This system is an open design for variation different configurations and controllers to support parallel manipulator research and applications. A parameters space investigation (PSI) algorithm with the Pareto optimal set was used to optimize parallel manipulator configuration with limited survey workspace. A tradition PID control and a self-tuning Fuzzy PID control algorithm were applied for real-time motion control of parallel manipulator. Quality system standards will be analyzed with different controllers. The system can be a useful tool for research and training purposes.

DE Distributed Measurement and Control; Precision Clock Synchronization;
   IEEE 1588; Reference Clock Connection
AB Clock and/or frequency synchronization is a common requirement in modern distributed measurement and control systems, such as Internet of Things (IoT). The required precision is application dependent; however, the possibility of sub 1 microsecond precision provided by low-cost advanced IEEE 1588 implementations sets the industry standard today. The performance and price of IEEE 1588 implementations are primarily defined by the master clocks and their actual installation and configuration. The paper investigate how master clock architectures, i.e., how the master clock is connected to the reference clock, influence price and performance; and in addition, it also details how the architecture effects installation and configuration requirements. The primary factors of investigation are ambient temperature and delay compensation required due to signal transmission time. The paper also introduces the architecture and performance of a Linux based open source/hardware prototype master clock developed by the author.

AB Timing is critical when trying to engage students in various engineering career paths. While many "National Engineers Week" programs exist for primary and middle school students, there is a lack of hands on activities for students in the 9th-12th grades. It is often difficult to devise experiments for this age group that are interesting and not juvenile. Yet, it is during these crucial years that most students are lost to science, math and engineering. Engaging students and presenting opportunities for invention and excitement is important in the teen years, when peer pressure and the distractions of friends, social events, and activities are particularly high.(1). There are a number of open source programming and affordable hardware platforms that can be used to implement low cost and interactive programs to promote innovation with various age groups. In this paper we share our work, as well as our learnings on how to make the workshops more effective. We have created various Arduino projects that can be customized to grade levels ranging from grades 7-12, and even college undergraduate students. The various projects we describe in this paper have been used to interact with students of different grade levels to engage in basic elements of engineering and computer programming. The classes should be set up to work in groups to promote shared innovation, teamwork and collaboration with peers. The open source and hardware experimenting exposed the students to various career paths ranging from software engineer, to electronic engineers and basic elements of various other engineering paths. This paper is designed to demonstrate the promotion of the engineering profession in schools through the use of Arduino Uno, Raspberry Pi Gemma kits, and Flora kits. The programs are also designed to accommodate classroom setting, workshops, or as an in-class field trip.

AB During last years unmanned ground and aerial vehicles captured the attention of researchers and companies, while the available set of Unmanned Surface Vehicle platforms is smaller. In many scenarios an integrated approach is required considering a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles. In this paper we focus on the development of a low-cost unmanned surface platform for digital surveys. The boat has been designed to navigate also in shallow water owing to a low draft design. An embedded system with Robot Operating System (ROS) onboard has been deployed on the surface vehicle. One of the main advantages of the proposed solution is its reduced cost owing to open-hardware/software solutions. In particular, an open-hardware solution is responsible for the interfacing of an RTK GPS with a bathymetric ultrasound sensor to map the sea/lake / river floor. The boat can be either remotely controllable or fully autonomous. An Augmented Reality (AR) application has been also developed to show the path and the set of survey blocks that are mapped/not mapped. The AR application is particularly useful when the user remotely controls the boat, but also for supervising the autonomous survey. The performances achieved in the first trials are satisfactory and the AR application produces significant maps.

AB This paper presents the design of a Detection System Crisis Episodes of depression in older adults. The system allows monitoring wirelessly through two modules: movement patterns and physiological markers of the patient. The first module is open technology based as is Raspberry Pi and Open CV to process images to identify movement patterns. The second module uses an Arduino pro mini with temperature and pulse sensor to logging information of the physiological data (heart rate and temperature). The information obtained is processed on a Web server through an application for viewing in a Web page or mobile device. With this information the attending physician or can correlate the variability of heart rate, temperature and movement pattern and determine by monitoring the state of the Depression in Elderly. This system is designed to send alert messages via MSN to physician and family in emergency situations such as extreme temperatures, irregular heartbeat, and absence or excess movement.
